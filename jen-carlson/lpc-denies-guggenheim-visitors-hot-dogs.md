<p>What better to pair up with your trip to the Guggenheim than a nice packaged portion of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170223/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/04/mechanically-separated-meat-chicken-mcnugget-photo_n_749893.html">meat paste</a>, or hot dogs, or whatever. Well, dream on carnivorous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170223/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/13/kandinsky.php">Kandinsky lovers</a>, because the Landmarks Preservation Commission just denied the museum its Andre Kikoski designed food kiosk&#x2014;a move that shocked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170223/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/10/20/no_hotdogging_for_the_guggenheim_as_snack_bar_gets_skewered.php">Eater</a>. According to the website&#x2014;which posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170223/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/10/18/the_guggenheim_museum_sheds_a_tear_for_hot_dog_fans.php">these renderings</a> earlier this week&#x2014;&quot;the commissioners said the tiny teardrop-shaped stand underneath the Fifth Avenue overhang was too intrusive and distracted from Frank Lloyd Wright&apos;s landmark.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it shouldn&apos;t be that surprising since this is the same LPC that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170223/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/16/painting_the_gu.php">agonized over shades of paint</a> for the museum&apos;s exterior.</p>
