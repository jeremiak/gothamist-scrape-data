The 19-year-old was the only person listed on her Last Will and Testament, which Houston signed in 1993, a month before her daughter was born, and amended in April 2000. While Houston was still with Bobby Brown at the time she amended it, and he <em>is</em> mentioned in the will, he&apos;ll receive nothing. <p></p>

<p>Houston&apos;s money troubles have been well publicized, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730233151/http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/07/whitney-houston-will-bobbi-kristina/#.T1i0ZpdSRoA">according to TMZ</a> her estate is still valued at $20 million (this includes all &quot;furnishings, clothing, personal effects, jewelry and cars&quot;). This will be put into a trust, &quot;which Bobbi will have access to in stages... earning a portion when she turns 21, another chunk when she turns 25, and the rest when she turns 30.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730233151/http://insideedition.com/news/7791/whitney-houstons-will-revealed.aspx">Inside Edition</a> had a first look at the will, and has a two-page PDF from the 19-page document&#x2014;Houston&apos;s mother Cissy is the executor.</p>

<p>Bobbi Kristina has been silent since the death of her mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730233151/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/11/whitney_houston_has_died_at_age_48.php">on February 11th</a>, although there have been plenty of rumors about family members wanting to send her to rehab. Tomorrow she&apos;ll break her silence when she records an interview with Oprah Winfrey, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730233151/http://www.tmz.com/2012/03/06/whitney-houston-bobbi-kristina-oprah/#.T1YCJtGXRoA">she says she trusts</a>, that will air on Sunday.</p>
