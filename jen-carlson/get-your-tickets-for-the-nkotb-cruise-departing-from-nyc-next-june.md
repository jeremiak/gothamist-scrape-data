<p>The cruise itself won&apos;t happen until next June (the 5th through the 9th), and if you decide to hop aboard you&apos;ll be sailing from New York City to Bermuda on a Carnival Cruise ship. The ticket price (which isn&apos;t listed, but you know: priceless) will include four nights on the ship, parties, &quot;face time&quot; with the guys, a NKOTB concert, all meals and snacks, a free day in Bermuda, full use of the ship facilities (spa, casino, fitness center, pools, etc), and all the screaming your ears can handle.</p>
