Last year the Queens Supreme Court ruled the board had the right to ban pets, but the Appellate Division rejected their ruling this week, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130850/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/11/2010-11-11_appellate_court_rejects_2009_ruling__queens_condo_board_cant_boot_cute_quiet_can.html">the Daily News</a>. </p>

<p>The Appellate Court argued that a ban must be written into the bylaws and approved by 80% of the condo owners&#x2014;the Middle Village board <em>did</em> get the approval, but neglected to write it into the bylaws. While they do have a no-nuisance provision which bans pets that disturb other residents (this can sometimes lead to an owner turning to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130850/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/03/debarking.php">controversial debarking</a>), the teacup pup Charlie (pictured) has never had any complaints filed against him.</p>

<p>Yesterday Charlie&apos;s owner&#x2014;52-year-old Donata Forman&#x2014;said after the 2009 ruling she decided, &quot;I&apos;m going all the way with [the case]. I need him because he&apos;s a part of the family.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428130850/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/in-the-case-of-a-terrier-no-pets-allowed-is-overruled/">she <em>also</em> said</a>, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s not one of those yapping little dogs. I would get rid of him if he was.&quot; Ah, just like a real family.</p>
