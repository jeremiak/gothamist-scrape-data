Earlier this month, the duo (friends of O&apos;Neal&apos;s) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025343/http://video.staged.com/allendaniels/opie_and_anthony_patrice_oneal_announcement">announced</a> that it was uncertain if O&apos;Neal, a diabetic, would recover, and today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025343/https://twitter.com/#!/OpieRadio/status/141572977442562048">Opie Tweeted</a>: &quot;Yes it&apos;s true that our pal Patrice O&apos;Neal has passed away. The funniest and best thinker I&apos;ve ever known PERIOD.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this year O&apos;Neal, who had been living in NYC since 2002, roasted Charlie Sheen, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025343/http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2011/10/charlie-sheen-sends-best-wishes-to-patrice-oneal/">this to say</a> about the comedian after his stroke shortly thereafter: &quot;[Patrice] is a gentle giant, a brilliant comedian, and a noble dude. Wishing him nothing but recovery, healing and laughter.&quot;</p>
