<p>In 1975, a year before the show as you know it premiered on television, a half-hour variety show titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171403/http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show:_Sex_and_Violence"><em>The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence</em></a> piloted on ABC. It was meant to &#x201C;parody the proliferation of sex and violence on television.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171403/http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/sex_violence_the_very_first_muppet_show_pilot_1974">Dangerous Minds</a> revisited the old pilot on YouTube, and note, &quot;watching this pilot it&#x2019;s clear that Henson and co. were aiming for a more adult-orientated, risqu&#xE9; edge to the material, akin to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171403/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/22/jason_segel_1.php">the sketches they provided in the very early years of Saturday Night Live</a> (and which were deemed, in the end, not to work.)&quot;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171403/http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show:_Sex_and_Violence">Muppet Wiki</a> page, it aired on March 19th, 1975, and was shot on December 10-16, 1974. &quot;It was one of the two pilots produced for The Muppet Show. The other pilot, The Muppets Valentine Show, aired in 1974.&quot;</p>
