</div></div>					<p>Recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231073556/http://planetoddity.com/vintage-new-york-photographs/">PlaneOddity</a> posted a slew of old New York photos, all taken between the 1920s and 1960s. This one of the swastika-adorned Hindenburg zeppelin flying over Manhattan caught our eye. The Hindenburg flew over New York City on May 6th, 1937... just before meeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231073556/http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/disaster">its fiery end</a> in New Jersey (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231073556/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/himhindenburg1.htm">more video</a>). Surprisingly, of the 97 souls onboard, 62 survived the crash (though many suffered serious injuries).</p>
