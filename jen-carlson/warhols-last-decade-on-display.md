</div></div><p>Move over soup cans, The Brooklyn Museum is bringing Andy Warhol&apos;s later works to their walls this year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164405/http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/andy_warhol/">Andy Warhol: The Last Decade</a> (June 18th through September 12th) is the first major Warhol survey in New York since the 1989 exhibition at MoMA. It will include nearly 50 paintings that the artist created during his 15 minutes; the museum notes that &quot;during this time Warhol produced more works, in a considerable number of series and on a vastly larger scale, than at any other point in his forty-year career.&quot;</p>

<p>The exhibit is currently stationed in Forth Worth, but here&apos;s a sneak peak. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164405/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32778/joseph-ketner-on-andy-warhols-last-decade/">Art Info</a> talked to curator Joseph D. Ketner II, he told them: &quot;Warhol had two sides to his work: his business and painting. The business side we know: making society portraits, being a male model, producing television programs, but what he was quietly doing in his studio, unbeknownst to most everyone in his last decade, were personal, monumental paintings, completely different than anything he had done before.&quot;</p>
