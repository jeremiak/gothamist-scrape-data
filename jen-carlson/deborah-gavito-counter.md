Now, years later, she has a well-established (certified green) roof over her head, but still gives back to the market where her success took root. This Saturday Counter hosts NYC&apos;s second annual Organic Beer Bash, pouring over 30 organic beers and ciders from around the world. Admission is $30 (all beer samples and appetizers are included), and proceeds go to the Greenmarket.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about the history of Counter?</strong> Counter came about from selling vegan pastries and baked goods at the Union Square Greenmarket starting in 1993.  I still have my stand Body &amp; Soul at the market.  I had $300 and bartered with a restaurant called Manhattan Plaza Caf&#xE9;, which closed many, many years ago.  In exchange for the use of the restaurants kitchen once a week, I provided them with desserts. At first I prepped all day, baked all night, sold pastries the next day, and then went straight to a part-time job at the Village Voice pasting up their classified ads.  I worked 48 hours straight and then slept for two days. I can&#x2019;t imagine selling frozen muffins in a blizzard at this point in my life, but I spent so many years selling pastries in all kinds of ridiculous weather conditions, that I&#x2019;m extremely grateful to have a roof over my head and bathroom facilities at Counter.            </p>

<p><strong>What can people expect at the Beer Bash?</strong> They can expect to taste 35 all organic beers, along with appetizers made with beer, such as, Wolaver&apos;s Wit beer phyllo purse with spiced apples; Peak Nut Brown ale pecan pie; and Orlio Common Ale Beer Battered Corn Fritters.</p>

<p>All of the proceeds go to the Greenmarket and Food Systems Network of NYC. I wouldn&#x2019;t have my restaurant Counter without the Greenmarket.</p>
