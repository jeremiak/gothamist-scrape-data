<p>For some people (me), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110622/http://gothamist.com/tags/1990s">the 1990s</a> feel like the decade that happened before this current decade. My brain completely skips the first decade of the aughts, and brings me back to the era of flannel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110622/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/19/grunge.php">olive green fuzz, wack slacks</a>, and glorious youth. For this reason, it&apos;s very disorienting when I see things on Etsy labeled &quot;vintage&quot; when they are just from the 1990s. A Hole T-shirt is vintage now! That&apos;s crazy, because I just saw them at Lollapalooza on a bill with Sonic Youth and Pavement.</p>

<p>Anyway, this also means that I never expect footage showing 1990s NYC to look so vastly different from today&apos;s NYC, and yet here we are. Above, Japanese rock duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110622/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%27z">B&apos;z</a> brings you around Manhattan in their early-&apos;90s music video for &quot;Hot Fashion,&quot; and even the New Yorkers look different from today&apos;s&#x2014;maybe it&apos;s the rollerblades.</p>

<p>As one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110622/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/4pm64v/back_in_like_1990_or_91_this_japanese_band_bz/">Redditor</a> noted today, &quot;This music video is part of a larger mini movie called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110622/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Risky"><em>Film Risky</em></a> that was essentially a music video compilation. A cassette tape falls through a portal or something in Japan and a woman in NYC finds it, and Koshi Inaba has to track it down for... reasons.&quot;</p>
