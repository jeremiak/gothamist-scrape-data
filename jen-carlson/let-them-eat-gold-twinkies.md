<p>At last, a gold-encrusted dessert fit for a working class budget. Unlike the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507054903/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/18/super_expensive.php">$26 pancakes</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507054903/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/07/save_room_for_d.php">$25,000 frrrozen haute chocolate</a>, these little sweets still have a single-digit price tag.</p>

<p>They used to be called Tweenkees, but Brooklynite and organic culinary creator Sarah Magid has changed the name to: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507054903/http://www.sarahmagid.com/tweenkees.html">The Goldies</a>. Magid tells us they&apos;re made from &quot;organic dark chocolate sponge cake filled with organic vanillla or espresso whipped buttercream, then covered in organic dark chocolate ganache.&quot; And of course, gold metallic powder. </p>

<p>How much will they set you back? Just a smidge more than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507054903/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/21/soda_prices_on.php">$5 soda</a>; they&apos;re $6 each, or a dozen for $68. Pick some up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507054903/http://janandaya.com/">Jan &amp; Aya</a> in Greenpoint (they&apos;re only available on weekends).
