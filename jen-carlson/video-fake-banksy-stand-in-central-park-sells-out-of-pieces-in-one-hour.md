                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="FAKESYSTAND.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083153im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/FAKESYSTAND.jpg" width="640" height="387" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>On October 12th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083153/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/13/video_banksy_set_up_a_pop_up_booth.php">Banksy set up a stand</a> at Central Park South and 59th Street, selling original artwork for $60 a pop (even though each piece is worth hundreds of thousands)&#x2014;at the end of the day, he made $420, selling work to just three people. He stated on his website that this was a one-off thing, and he would not be setting up a stand again... so naturally, someone else did. </p>

<p>One week later a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083153/https://fakebookfriends.squarespace.com/blog/fake-banksy-sells-out">group got together</a> and sold replicas of the works at the same price, from the same location as Banksy&#x2014;&quot;everything was the same,&quot; except that they loudly advertised the pieces as FAKE. Each was even delivered with a certificate of inauthenticity. They posted a video today from their experiment (which they made $2,400 off of), saying: &quot;we saw an opportunity for a little mischief, and a chance to make a statement about the nature of hype, public personas, and the value of art.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though they were open about the pieces being fakes&#x2014;&quot;our sign said &apos;Fake Banksy,&apos; Mike assured every customer that it was fake&quot;&#x2014;they sold out in less than an hour. Unless, of course, the video is fake. And don&apos;t forget that &quot;reality&quot; itself is a bogus construct created by our deceitful senses and enslaved minds. </p>
