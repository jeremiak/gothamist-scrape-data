</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326162704/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedakota">The Dakota</a> was the city&apos;s first luxury apartment building, and it&apos;s now a historic icon&#x2014;something we doubt we&apos;ll be saying in 100 years about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326162704/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/101_bedford_speedo_ready.php">101 Bedford</a>. And now is your chance, multimillionaire, to purchase a piece of history. </p>

<p>A 4-bedroom has come <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326162704/http://www.sothebyshomes.com/nyc/sales/00110340">on the market</a>, featuring a library, a gallery, two wood burning fireplaces, &quot;elegantly proportioned rooms&quot; (important), and a bunch of other rooms that will eventually become your prison. Because money and an apartment at the Dakota won&apos;t make you happy. The 12-foot ceilings do open up the place nicely for a late in life hoarding habit, however.</p>

<p>Click through for a look at the apartment as it looks now&#x2014;that dope carpet probably isn&apos;t included.
