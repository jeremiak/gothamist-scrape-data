<p>The people at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520041142/http://www.skylinebooks.com/">Skyline Books</a> emailed us to let us know they&apos;d be closing up shop January 31st, 2010 &#x2014; after being in business since September of 1990. <em>Sigh.</em> They say they&apos;re just one of many independent bookstores folding under the pressures of increasing rents, online bookselling, and the city&apos;s changing landscape. They also believe they are one of the last bookstores to have a cat! (Our own John Del Signore points out that &quot;Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown has a 3 legged cat who will outlive us all.&quot;) The shop told us the owner may not be able to take her home due to other pets, saying: &quot;Linda is a territorial cat. She&apos;s had complete run of that bookstore her entire life, she&apos;s 8 years old, and for 8 years any dog that&apos;s intruded on her domain has been sent packing and she&apos;s pretty good at it. Ideally if another bookstore could take her. She&apos;s a book store cat, and there just aren&apos;t any left, book stores or book store cats. it&apos;s very sad.&quot;</p>
