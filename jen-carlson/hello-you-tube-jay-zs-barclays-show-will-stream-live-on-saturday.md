<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200118/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay-Z</a>&apos;s ending his eight-night (sold out) stint at Brooklyn&apos;s Barclays Center tomorrow night, and if you got shut out you can still watch it live. The show will be live-streamed on the rap mogul&apos;s new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200118/http://youtube.com/JAYZsLifeandTimes">Life+Times YouTube channel</a> starting at 9:30 p.m. tomorrow.</p>

<p>According to the press announcement, The Life+Times channel will &quot;focus on the new global cosmopolitan elite, [and] will be an expression of a man who has become an international cultural ambassador. The channel is a platform for JAY&apos;s many passions and interests, while serving as a hub for music, art, and cultural trendsetters.&quot; </p>

<p>When the party ends tomorrow night, the docu-series &quot;The Road To Brooklyn&quot; will play on the channel, which tracks the Nets&#x2019; journey to Atlantic Avenue. </p>
