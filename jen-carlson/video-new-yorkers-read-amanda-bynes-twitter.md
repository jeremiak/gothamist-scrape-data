title: Video: New Yorkers Read Amanda Bynes' Twitter
---

<p>Amanda Bynes recently quit acting and took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051529/http://twitter.com/chicky">to Twittering</a> <em>full time</em>. She has since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611051529/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/07/26/amanda-bynes-unretirement/">unretired</a>, but the good news is she can juggle both creative outlets. With lexical gems like: &quot;Let&apos;s all just mutually agree that Felicity was the best show ever,&quot; let&apos;s all just mutually agree that this is a good thing. Someone recently went around the streets of New York City to have locals read her Tweets aloud... enjoy!:</p>
