On June 8th you can attend the eco-friendly Gala for anywhere from $325 to $10,000, which includes a reserved seat to the concert (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135929/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/14/david_byrne_mus.php">Mr. David Bryne</a>), cocktails, dinner, and a dance party, and they ask that you wear summer cocktail attire (that sounds so Gatsby!). Those pinching their pennies can pay $0 to $3 (suggested donation) for non-reserved seats to the concert portion of the evening. Not a bad deal!</p>

<p>Many of the shows they put on at the Bandshell are free (again, there&apos;s a $3 suggested donation), and in order to keep it that way a number of &quot;benefit shows&quot; are thrown. This year those include MGMT, Animal Collective, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Rait and Taj Mahal (tickets to most of these are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135929/http://www.ticketmaster.com/search?tm_link=tm_homeA_header_search&amp;q=celebrate+brooklyn&amp;search.x=0&amp;search.y=0">currently on sale</a>). More will be announced when Celebrate Brooklyn! releases the full summer lineup in the next few weeks. </p>

<p>Stay tuned for a full guide to all of the outdoor shows when they&apos;re fully announced&#x2014;we&apos;re keeping our eye on the always fantastic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135929/http://seaportmusicfestival.com/">Seaport Music Festival</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135929/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/03/m_ward_others_p.html">Brooklyn Vegan</a> has a partial list of Central Park&apos;s Summerstage. On top of that, passes to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135929/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/18/northside_festival_announced.php">Northside Festival</a> in June <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135929/http://www.northsidefestival.com/2009/04/bands-announced-badges-on-sale/">just went on sale</a> (they&apos;ll be blocking off part of Bedford Avenue for it). Rejoice! Summer concert season is upon us!</p>
