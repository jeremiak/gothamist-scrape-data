<p>That was fast. The MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153857/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2010/06/17/from-fml-to-something-mundane/">has already changed</a> their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153857/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/14/fml.php">new subway signage</a> (representing the F, M and L lines at 14th Street) so that it doesn&apos;t read as an internet meme meaning: &quot;Fuck My Life.&quot; So... time to think of a fun meaning for LFM. Anyone?</p>

<p>Some ideas bantered around the office include: &quot;Lord, Fuck Me&quot; and &quot;Lick Fabio&apos;s Mullet&quot; (this would also make for a great single-serving site a la <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153857/http://selleckwaterfallsandwich.tumblr.com/">Selleck Waterfall Sandwich</a>).</p>
