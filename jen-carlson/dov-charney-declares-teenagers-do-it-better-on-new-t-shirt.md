<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005857/http://gothamist.com/tags/americanapparel">American Apparel</a> has teamed up with Electric Youth Magateen, which celebrates &quot;the magnificent vitality, energy and power of young male adulthood.&quot; The product of their collaboration: a t-shirt that reads &quot;Teenagers Do It Better,&quot; which comes with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005857/http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm2xt4pAdJ1qic21qo1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&amp;Expires=1313159889&amp;Signature=5%2FqUIQpUWn%2BU7dT4BJHlbVHNK7s%3D">this souvenir JPEG</a> of a scantily clad teen in undies and a cut-off version of the conversation tee. (Just in time for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005857/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/10/sex_ed_will_be_mandatory_in_nyc_sch.php">mandatory sex ed classes</a> in NYC!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005857/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/09/american-apparel-teenagers-do-it-better_n_922160.html">HuffPo</a> calls this Dov Charney&apos;s &quot;first foray into sartorial pedophilia, creating a shirt that glorifies teens engaging in sex.&quot;</p>

<p>You can get the shirt by ordering the mag&apos;s 124-page Spring/Summer issue, which features &quot;sexy pics of boys ages 16 to 21&quot; and 18 &quot;sexy stickers&quot;! You can also buy it online at American Apparel&apos;s store <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005857/http://store.americanapparel.net/2001spey.html?cid=200">for $24</a>, but you might look a little bit more than creepy walking around in it if you aren&apos;t in high school.</p>
