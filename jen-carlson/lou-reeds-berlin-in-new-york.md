This December Lou Reed will do a four night run at St. Ann&apos;s Warehouse, performing his 1973 album, <em>Berlin</em>. Though it quickly became a cult favorite upon it&apos;s release, this is the first time the record has ever been performed live. The concept album is a follow up to his prior hit record, <em>Transformer</em>. 

</p><p>According to the press release, this will be &quot;a theatrically realized concert version of Reed&#x2019;s stylized rock paean to life outside the circle, the orchestrations filled with the lyrics of the broken hearted and willfully disabled...the drifting tormented addicts of love formalizing their own downfalls in the outskirts of the divided city.&quot;</p>

<p>Tickets are $65 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515213637/http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=xxx&amp;query=search&amp;category=misc&amp;search=lou+reed+berlin&amp;searchregion=xxx&amp;genre=none&amp;beginmonth=08&amp;beginday=24&amp;beginyear=2006&amp;endmonth=08&amp;endday=24&amp;endyear=2007&amp;sortorder=0">and available now</a>), expensive yes, but worth it. At least, we hope so. Above is a clip of Reed performing &quot;Wild Side&quot; in 1983 at the Bottom Line, NYC. Sort of unimpressive, but we&apos;ll give him the benefit of the doubt. Since he&apos;s, like, Lou Reed and all.  </p>
