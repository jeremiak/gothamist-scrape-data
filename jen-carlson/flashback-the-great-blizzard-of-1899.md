</div></div>					<p>Could we learn something from the blizzard survivors of 1899? Or at least, images of them walking through a seemingly <em>functional</em> city after getting at least 16 inches of snow? It can be done, people! Mayor! MTA! Just look, their snow removal process seemed to clear the streets <em>and</em> sidewalks&#x2014;albeit, the job was likely tedious (it mostly consisted of men shoveling snow into a horse drawn cart). And their public transportation was somehow magically up and running! Click through to see how New Yorkers handled the snow back then.</p>

<p>A little history: the Great Blizzard of 1899 (which started on February 11th of that year) mostly affected the southern United States, but even in NYC it was a powerful storm. Central Park recorded 16 inches, which at the time was its third-biggest snowfall, and surrounding areas recorded 2-3 feet!</p>

<p>One of the oldest New York movies was made during that time, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151850/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230326/plotsummary"><em>In the Grip of the Blizzard</em></a>&#x2014;which according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151850/http://updateslive.blogspot.com/2006/08/union-square-under-blizzard-one-of.html">this blog</a> was an early work of Dziga Vertov... who according to Roger Ebert, was the inspiration for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151850/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/video_oscar-worthy_short_film_docum.php">this Blizzard of 2010 short</a>. We&apos;re searching for video of the 1899 film, and will update if we find it...</p>
