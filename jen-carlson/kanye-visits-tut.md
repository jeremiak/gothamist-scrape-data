<p>Kanye West just did a better job at visiting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230943/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/23/here_comes_tut.php">King Tut exhibition</a> than you. Seriously, what did <em>you</em> wear when you went to pay your respects to Tutankhamun? The exhibit&apos;s organizers tell us West came in &quot;wearing some great Egyptian bling&#x2014;including a pyramid ring [we hear it&apos;s a 4-finger $3,000 ring] and a pendant of Horus, the Egyptian god of the sky.&quot; Here he is pictured stealing the thunder of King Tut&apos;s great-grandmother Tjuya in her paltry golden coffin. (And if you haven&apos;t stopped by the Times Square exhibit yet, you have until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131230943/http://www.kingtut.org/home">January 2nd</a>.)</p>
