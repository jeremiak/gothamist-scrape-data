                            <p><em>Playboy</em> magazine is unloading a ton of artwork on the auction block this December 8th, with a Christie&apos;s event titled The Year of the Rabbit. This includes a Salvador Dali watercolor that&apos;s been hanging in Hugh Hefner&apos;s bedroom (and appeared in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926011025/http://www.55max.com/proddet.asp?ProdID=1774&amp;CM=0">a 1967 issue</a>), 80 photographs, 24 cartoons and a dozen contemporary works, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926011025/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iGQ1T6TwH7R_EdyStRRfEIgsIhOQ?docId=d0c6edd3e78a458baff4183aa4d6a57e">the AP</a>. </p>

<p>Nearly all of the items going up for auction have appeared in the magazine, and Christie&apos;s Cathy Elkies says because of that, &quot;there&apos;s a link between the collection and the ethos of the publication itself.&quot; Even after the auction, <em>Playboy</em> will have a lot of original works on hand, they reportedly have 20 million photographs in a storage building, and 5,000 contemporary artworks in their archives. In the below video, Heffner says, &quot;<em>Playboy</em> helped to change the very direction of commercial art&#x2014;breaking down the wall between fine art and commercial art.&quot;</p>

<p>If you&apos;re more a <em>Playboy</em> fan than art aficionado, you&apos;ll appreciate some of the other items on the block, like layout boards from old issues. One example of this is a 1996 cover photograph of Playmate of the Year Stacy Sanchez, with Hefner&apos;s sign off and editorial comments like &quot;move leg to this position&quot; and &quot;missing eye shadow.&quot; Amongst the cover girls to go on auction are Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, and even Anna Nicole Smith.</p>
