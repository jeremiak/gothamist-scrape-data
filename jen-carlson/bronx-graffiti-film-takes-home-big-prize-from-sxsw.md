<p>New York-based writer/director Adam Leon&apos;s first feature, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200634/http://gimmethelootmovie.com/"><em>Gimme Some Loot</em></a>, took home the big prize (the Grand Jury Prize for best narrative feature) at SXSW&apos;s film festival this year. The story follows a pair of teenage Bronx graffiti artists throughout two summer days, and stars Tysheeb Hickson and Tashiana R. Washington. On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200634/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/872587601/get-gimme-the-loot-to-sxsw-and-nd-nf-this-spring">their Kickstarter</a>, they describe the plotline:</p>

<blockquote>When Malcolm and Sofia&apos;s latest graffiti masterpiece is buffed by a rival gang, these two determined Bronx teens must hustle, steal, and scheme to get spectacular revenge and become the biggest writers in the City.</blockquote>  

<p>The film was shot last summer all over New York City, and Leon says, &quot;&apos;we wanted to do hits, B-sides and rarities,&apos; with some scenes in iconic New York City locations, and others in places that have been mostly unexplored on the big screen. &apos;We were in 50 locations. We wanted to be all over the city, in a rich person&#x2019;s home, in a bodega, in the middle of Queens in the rain. We wanted to be this kind of low-budget epic.&apos;&quot; And for the graffiti aspect, they brought in the legendary SP1 as an adviser, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200634/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/competing-narratives-at-sxsw/?pagewanted=all">ArtsBeat</a> says &quot;the film contains very little graffiti writing.&quot;</p>
