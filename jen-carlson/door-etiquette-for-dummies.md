										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="elevatorbuttons.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522135502im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/elevatorbuttons.jpg" width="275" height="163" class="image-left"> </span>Sometimes it can be really annoying if someone holds the door for you when you are still like 20 feet away, but are New Yorkers equally annoyed when a door <em>isn&apos;t</em> held for them? NY1&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522135502/http://www.patspapers.com/story_stack/item/door_etiquette/">Pat Kiernan</a> points to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522135502/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/family/sc-fam-0401-lifeskills-revolving-door-20100401,0,6102807.story">an article</a> on door etiquette, which explains how to handle two door-holding scenarios. You know, in case you needed help with that.</p>

<p>The author of <em>Etiquette for Dummies</em> explains that gender is no longer an issue, rather whoever arrives at the door first should hold it open, unless that person is elderly. No shocking revelations there... but did you know if you are a junior at your company you should be holding the door open for senior execs... and if it&apos;s a revolving door the higher ranking person should go first so you can push it for them?!</p>

<p>Sadly, the article doesn&apos;t get in to elevator doors, which is really the most juicy door option to discuss if one <em>must</em> discuss door etiquette. Be honest, do you push the &quot;door close&quot; button more often than you push the &quot;hold door&quot; button?</p>
