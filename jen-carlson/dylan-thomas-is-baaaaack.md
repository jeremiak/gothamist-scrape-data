She was with her boyfriend, but he slept soundly through the sighting. She reports back from Room 114:</p><blockquote>I am not a complete believer in ghosts... the entire night was too vivid and the details too accurate and fresh in my mind for me to 100% believe that it was a dream.<br>
 <br>
That night, we ended up going to bed around 1:30 am. My boyfriend fell asleep immediately. It was not the same for me. I had a strange feeling, not a good feeling at all. Nothing had happened, but this overwhelming feeling crept over me, and I felt my heart beating nearly out of my chest. I began sweating profusely. I suddely heard a door slam extremely loudly and a man yelling with the sound of frantic footsteps running down the hallway. I froze. The running continued for another three minutes or so and then was gone. I then heard the sound of footsteps creeping in the room behind me. This continued the entire night.<p></p>

<p>Somewhere during the course of two hours, I suddenly looked up and right in front of the bedroom mirror, I saw a head in mid-air. The head seemed to grimace at me, and I will never forget the eyes staring me down, almost bug-eyed. The face seemed to be wearing some kind of theatre make-up, bright red lips drawn on very carefully, white face paint, and ear-length tightly coiled black hair. I have an idea of who this man was after looking at images of the famous that lived there and departed to the afterlife. The picture I observed made my stomach sink..it was the same face, that same grimace, and those same sad and large eyes. It looked like Dylan Thomas&apos; face.</p></blockquote>Perhaps this is proof that there is whiskey in the afterlife. But the story is sort of chills-inducing, no? Thomas was living in Room 206 of the hotel at the time of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202423/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas#Death">his death</a>.<p></p>
