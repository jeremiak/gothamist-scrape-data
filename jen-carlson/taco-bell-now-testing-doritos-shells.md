                            <p>Taco Bell may be thinking outside the bun, but they are thinking <em>inside</em> the minds of stoned college kids nationwide! The chain is currently testing out Doritos flavored taco shells, which... how has this not already happened? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901213039/http://www.slashfood.com/2011/04/13/taco-bell-tests-nacho-cheese-doritos-taco-shells/">Slashfood</a>, the Doritos Locos Tacos are only being served up in select test markets, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901213039/http://www.grubgrade.com/2011/04/08/doritos-locos-tacos-from-taco-bell/">one town in Ohio</a> (warning: link contains incredibly bright neon orange colors, you may want to put on your sunglasses). </p>

<p>Perhaps one day soon, however, every American will have the right to crunch into these unnatural wonders. Watch as one brave, young citizen accepts his role as one of Taco Bell&apos;s test monkeys.</p>
