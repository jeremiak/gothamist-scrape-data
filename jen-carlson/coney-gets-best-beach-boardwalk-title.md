<p>Summer&apos;s here, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213148/http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-best-beach-boardwalks/1">Travel + Leisure</a> is looking at the best oceanside attractions nationwide, or as they label it: America&apos;s Best Beach Boardwalks. Coming out on top: our very own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213148/http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-best-beach-boardwalks/2">Coney Island</a>!</p>

<p>The mag doesn&apos;t make note of the fact that part of the iconic 2.7-mile long boardwalk is being replaced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213148/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/coney_island_boardwalk_to_become_co.php">with concrete slabs</a> (as the old wood gets an afterlife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213148/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/03/coney_island_boardwalk_becomes_furn.php">as furniture</a>), and instead focuses on all the shiny things the shoreline has to offer, namely: the Tickler (and other rides, new and old), Nathan&apos;s hotdogs, and all the sword-swallowing sideshow freaks. </p>

<p>One expert told the magazine that boardwalks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213148/http://gothamist.com/tags/coneyisland">Coney</a>&apos;s are making a comeback, and that &quot;visiting one is a quintessentially American summer experience.&quot; But what about the area&apos;s recent history? The struggle between locals and Joe Sitt stayed out of the travel publication&apos;s pages, where they simply note that &quot;in a desire to appeal to families, New York City planners want to expand amusement parks here to 12 acres and return the boardwalk, which has slowly deteriorated over the decades, to its former carnival glory.&quot;</p>
