<p>If we&apos;re to believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128163200/http://hudsonvalley.craigslist.org/cto/2777951764.html">this Craigslist posting</a> (spotted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128163200/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/01/early-buzz-wilco-starbucks-tina-fey-and-more-news/1">Pop Candy</a>), then Sarah Michelle Gellar bought a new car right before embarking on her <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> journey in 1996. This &apos;95 Chrysler Le Baron convertible is said to have been purchased by Gellar when it was new, and now the current owner is letting it go for just under $3,000. A Le Baron? This all sounds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128163200/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mom_%26_Pop_Store">very familiar</a>! They write:</p>

<blockquote>1995 CHRYSLER LE BARON GTC CONVERTIBLE. ALL ORIGINAL. BOUGHT NEW BY ACTRESS SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER). BLUISH GREEN WITH TAN TOP. ALL OPTIONS. MOVING AND MUST SELL. TAN LEATHER INTERIOR. 6 CYL. AUTOMATIC.</blockquote> 

<p>The car is right here in New York, in Rockland County (about an hour from Manhattan) for any interested parties. But you really may want to verify that it&apos;s Gellar&apos;s car first, maybe check the glove compartment for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128163200/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm2iNNqj2fQ&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLE9DA999D956B85CE">a chewed up pencil</a>.</p>
