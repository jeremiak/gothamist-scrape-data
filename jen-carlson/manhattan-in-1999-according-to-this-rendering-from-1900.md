<p>It&apos;s fun to look back at how people envisioned New York City in &quot;the future,&quot; now that we&apos;re living said future. Just like that plan to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226225638/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/16/1924_traffic_congestion_solution_dr.php">drain the East River</a> never happened, neither did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226225638/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/23/flashback_time_to_bring_in_the_dept.php">depthscrapers</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226225638/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/20/2level_streets.php">two-level streets</a>. The latest rendering to pop up online (we DO have the internet here in the future) is from 1900, and originally ran in Joseph Pulitzer&apos;s New York World newspaper. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226225638/http://www.skyscraper.org/EXHIBITIONS/FUTURE_CITY/NEW_YORK_MODERN/walkthrough_1900.php">Skyscraper Museum</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>At the turn of the twentieth century, one of the World&apos;s most popular illustrators, Louis Biedermann, speculated on the future New York in 1999 in a lavish two-page spread that pictured Manhattan solidly packed with skyscrapers, including behemoth towers at least a hundred-stories tall, sporting landing platforms of airships.

<p>At a time when there were no controls on high-rise development, Biedermann&apos;s illustration exaggerated present trends and technologies and reflected both the fascination and fears of unconstrained growth.</p></blockquote>While we don&apos;t quite have the spaceship type crafts Biedermann included in his illustration, his vision doesn&apos;t look to far off from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226225638/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/18/flashback_swastika_adorned_hindenburg.php#photo-1">this photo</a> of the Hindenburg over Manhattan, in 1936. It also didn&apos;t look that far off from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226225638/http://walkinnewyork.blogspot.com/2009/10/lower-manhattans-financial-district.html">Manhattan skyline in 1900</a>.
