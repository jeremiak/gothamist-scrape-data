According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204353/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/6/33_06_sb_missing_chicken.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, Rebecca Lax and her two daughters just procured two of the feathered friends to provide them with fresh eggs from their backyard on 6th Avenue and 1st Street&#x2014;but upon getting them home, one flew the coop!<p></p>

<p>Area residents, and Lax herself, have spotted the missing chicken over the past few days&#x2014;roaming through backyards and roosting in trees at night&#x2014;but no one has been able to catch it yet. They suspect she&apos;ll be making her way to 5th Avenue soon if she continues in the same direction... or maybe she&apos;s already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204353/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/27/video_chicken_on_the_6_train_no_big.php">found the subway</a>?</p>

<p>Back at the homestead, the remaining hen has been too nervous without her partner in crime that she hasn&apos;t been able to produce any eggs. If you catch her stray friend before a raccoon does, there&apos;s 20 bucks in it for you.</p>
