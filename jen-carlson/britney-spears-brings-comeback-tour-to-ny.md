</div></div><p>Last night Britney Spears took her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173348/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/02/britneys_big_apple_circus.php">Circus act</a> to the Nassau Coliseum stage on Long Island, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173348/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/ny-etbrit1212540951mar12,0,6267318.story">Newsday</a>, the final word in concert reviews, has a scathing account. The paper makes note of the audience member lapdance, the pop star getting sawed in three, and the Bollywood dance number, but they say it&apos;s all &quot;a massive money-making venture designed to play up her talents and distract from her shortcomings.&quot; Is this not the foundation upon which pop stars are built? The criticisms continue, as they declare <strong>&quot;she always gets a lot of help from her troupe of 12 dancers, who pull her across the stage or give her rides on their bicycles so we don&apos;t notice she&apos;s only moving at two-thirds speed or not doing all the moves her dancers are.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173348/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03122009/news/regionalnews/circus_of_the_spears_159225.htm">the Post</a> points out that &quot;in the five years since she last toured, she&apos;s gotten married and divorced - twice; become a mom - twice; and was even committed to a mental institution for a short stay.&quot; And they think that while she probably didn&apos;t do any real singing, she was sporting a &quot;buff new bod.&quot; How do you think Brit Brit looks these days?</p>
