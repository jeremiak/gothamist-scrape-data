That&apos;s right, folks, &quot;Joe Wurzelbacher, better known as &apos;Joe the Plumber&apos; was seen at the &apos;Saturday Night Live&apos; after party &apos;canoodling&apos; with cast member Kristen Wiig,&quot; <em>and</em> (perhaps even more disturbing) &quot;chatting up a major Hollywood agent about starring the in next season of The Bachelor.&quot; One witness who saw Joe at his hotel the next day said, &quot;it wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me if someone got her drain snaked last night...I ran into Joe this morning at the hotel...and ever the gentleman, he refused to reveal more than his mile-wide grin.&quot; <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Psych! NYMag just updated saying this is all a total hoax. Phew! But we hear that Tina Fey and Cindy McCain totally accidentally touched hands at the end of last week&apos;s episode.</p>
