<p>According to the federal lawsuit charges filed yesterday, hubby Kevin Hunter sought out help from a WBLS studio employee in finding a hit man to &quot;off&quot; Hot97 personality <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055235/http://www.hot97.com/missjones">Tarsha Jones</a>. The allegations are part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055235/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j0gyXgMa5SxK4wPyQjR_KPKPyFkAD918GHAG3">a sexual harassment suit</a> filed by Nicole Spence, 27, the talent booker for Williams&apos; show. </p>

<p>In March, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055235/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03252008/news/regionalnews/djs_hubby_beat_her__aide_103431.htm">the NY Post</a> reported on Spence&apos;s troubles at the station when she filed papers with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The complaint included &quot;that her boss&apos; husband, Kevin Hunter, 33, demanded sex from her more than a dozen times and created a hostile work environment by repeatedly beating up Williams, 43, in and near the studio.&quot;</p>

<p>Two years ago, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055235/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/01/hot_97_under_ny.php">installed a surveillance camera</a> outside of Hot97&apos;s Hudson Street offices following a few shootings linked to the station. Maybe they need to install some inside, as well. That same year The New Yorker also wrote a lengthy piece on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055235/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/10/060710fa_fact1">Hot97 &quot;Turf Wars&quot;</a>. </p>
