title: What If 5th Avenue Had No Cars, But Conveyor Belt Transportation Instead?

<p>What if parts of Manhattan didn&apos;t have vehicular traffic, but instead conveyor-belt transportation? We&apos;ve visited the idea of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417170016/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/08/flashback_moving_sidewalks_where_ar.php#photo-1">moving sidewalks</a> as it was proposed in the late 1800s, but here&apos;s a later proposal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417170016/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2012/03/21/why-dont-we-have-moving-sidewalks-for-city-shopping/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ModernMechanix+%28Modern+Mechanix%29">from 1954</a>, which would have eliminated all wheeled traffic (and thus &quot;roaring motors and noxious fumes&quot;) as well as &quot;nervous pedestrians scurrying back and forth at dangerous intersections.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Imagine, instead, a leafy-mall extending down the avenue&#x2019;s center, green with trees and bushes, brightened with flowers and flanked by a continuous stream of comfortable public cars, flowing smoothly along on silent, rubber belts. In them, milady sits and window-shops at a leisurely pace, hopping on and off at any point she desires. Imagine, too, a pair of subsidiary moving sidewalks with safe, convenient entrances and exits, upon which the pedestrian may ride along at a normal walking pace or gain easy access to the faster-moving cars.</blockquote>

<p>The overall idea was to bring &quot;a continuous belt-borne line of small passenger cars, moving in endless procession around a landscaped mall which extends from 58th to 14th streets. Two car types are shown, open and covered. A convertible model could easily be designed also. Each contains nine seats, facing the store fronts and stepped up in bleacher style to permit comfortable, unimpeded window shopping.&quot; Passengers would be able to hop on and off at any point via a speedwalk that traveled at the same rate.</p>

<p>Apparently Goodyear&#x2019;s Conveyor-Belt Division was the best shot at making this pipe dream happen, with 36-inch wide belts that &quot;can move nearly 20,000 tons of coal in a 24-hour day.&quot; Of course, this never became a reality, but the renderings show the conception of the future Fifth Avenue, had the city decided to move in this direction. </p>

<p>At the time, the Modern Mechanix writer asked, &quot;Does all this sound like a hashish smoker&#x2019;s dream of a shopper&#x2019;s paradise?&quot;</p>
