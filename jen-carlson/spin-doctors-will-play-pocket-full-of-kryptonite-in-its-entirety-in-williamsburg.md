<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="spindocs0911.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110929110733im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/spindocs0911.jpg" width="274" height="329" class="image-right"> </span>Do you think the Williamsburg population loves the Spin Doctors ironically, or unironically at this point? Like, probably some of the people who moved in to the fancy waterfront condos brought <em>Pocket Full of Kryptonite</em> with them, right? Either way, the Spin Doctors are coming for you, Brooklyn, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110929110733/http://www.brooklynbowl.com/event/65391/">show at Brooklyn Bowl</a> where they&apos;ll play that very album in its entirety.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110929110733/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_Doctors">The Internet</a>, &quot;The history of the Spin Doctors can be traced back to the late 1980s in New York City, originally as a band called Trucking Company, which included John Popper (!)... the classic line-up was in place by the spring of 1989.&quot; A few short years later they were off the map again, having never been able to top their debut album.</p>

<p>Now (well, on October 23rd), you can relive their glory days for the price of $10 to $15. Until that magical evening, let&apos;s revisit the hits:</p>
