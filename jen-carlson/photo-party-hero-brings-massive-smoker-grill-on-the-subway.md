<p>Yesterday &apos;Merica met the New York City subway system when one brave man dared to bring a giant smoker grill on to the train. And unless the same guy was spotted in his journey, this may have been a holiday trend: </p>

<p>Maybe we&apos;re getting lax in our old age, but we&apos;re gonna give this guy a pass in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003654/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> department. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003654/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/56_million_suckers_to_leave_nyc_for.php">5.6 million people fled New York for the holiday</a>, leaving our subway cars blissfully empty, so he wasn&apos;t imposing on anyone. And this clunky thing probably weighed about 75 lbs <em>minimum</em>, making this guy The Hero of the party he was going to. We salute you, man.
