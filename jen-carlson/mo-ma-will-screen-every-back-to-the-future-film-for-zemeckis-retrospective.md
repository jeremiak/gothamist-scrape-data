<p>This morning MoMA announced it would be bringing us... <em>Back to the Future</em>. The museum will screen all three films in the series as a part of an upcoming Robert Zemeckis retrospective, which is occurring 30 years after the first <em>Back to the Futrure</em> was released.</p>

<blockquote>On October 3, MoMA will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of Back to the Future by screening all three Back to the Future films in succession, just in advance of October 21, 2015, the future date that Marty McFly travels to in Back to the Future II (1989).</blockquote>

<p><em>What Lies Beneath: The Films of Robert Zemeckis</em> will open on September 29th with his latest film, <em>The Walk</em>, before the event (closing October 18th) takes a look back at the director&apos;s previous works. The retrospective &quot;will include <em>all of Zemeckis&apos; feature films</em> as well as a selection of his television work and student films.&quot; Zemeckis said, &quot;I am thrilled to be receiving this tremendous honor from MoMA. It&apos;s hard to believe that I&apos;ve been making films for more than 30 years. I feel extraordinarily thankful that I have had the opportunity to make these films, and to have the chance to see them all, in a great theater, where audiences can enjoy them, is very gratifying.&quot;</p>

<p>The director/producer/screenwriter will also be on hand, participating in a Q&amp;A; after <em>The Walk</em> screening, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006203037/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/09/man_on_wire_movie.php">a 3D feature</a> retelling the story of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006203037/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/24/philippe_petit_man_on_wire.php">Philippe Petit</a>&apos;s high wire walk between the World Trade Center towers.</p>
