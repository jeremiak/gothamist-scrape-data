	<p>We were going to revisit New York City in 1969 (possibly the upcoming year for, at least some of, the final season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082319/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>) through footage from the year covering everything from the the Stonewall Riots to the Rolling Stones at MSG. But then we found this 7-minute video of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082319/http://www.alexgitlin.com/motions.htm">The Motions</a>, one of the bigger bands to come out of the 1960s Dutch Beat Explosion that you probably didn&apos;t know existed. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082319/http://mreliminator.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-motions-introduction-to-motions.html">The band</a>, who hailed from The Hague, had actually opened for the Stones years earlier on their home turf... and event that resulted in riot. This 1964 concert was the Stones&apos; first in the Netherlands and it didn&apos;t even last 30 minutes. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082319/http://members.chello.nl/f.dejonge/stoneshistory.htm">this recollection</a>: &quot;The building (Kurhaus) was demolished, chairs were flying around. Girls underwear, as Keith said, was hanging in the chandeliers. It was really a night to remember.&quot;</p>
