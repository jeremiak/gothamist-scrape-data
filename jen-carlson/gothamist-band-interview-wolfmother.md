It was hot and threatening rain outside. When it poured for a few minutes, people ran in through the huge garage doors and stood in the open area in front of the stage - we were all dripping a mixture of sweat and rain. Soon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140144/http://www.wolfmother.com/2005.html">Wolfmother</a> was there. It felt like a true rock n&apos; roll moment, because they were the soundtrack for it. The anthemic modernized 70&apos;s guitar rock made the warehouse feel like a stadium. And that&apos;s our story, we fell in love with this band at 2:30am in a warehouse in East Austin. We plan to carry on this sonic affair this weekend when they play Webster Hall. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
I believe it first came from Italy. The latin origin &quot;Madrevius di lupovius&quot; means, &quot;children born of the beast will steal the shadow of the forest and chase the stars from the night.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>How and when did you all meet...how did you become Wolfmother?</strong> <br>
We met in the late 90&apos;s through friends, we jammed together for a long time and then decided to put some songs together and play a gig or two in early 2004.</p>

<p><strong>There&apos;s a list of comparisons that often comes when someone writes about your band...Led Zep, Styxx, White Stripes, Black Sabbath...who do you count as influences?</strong>  <br>
The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Who, Sabbath, Air, The Beastie Boys, Cream, David Axelrod, Sleep, Kyuss, Death In Vegas, Desert Sessions, Early Q.O.T.S.A., Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Kings of Leon, King Crimson, Primal Scream, the Strokes. We would go to see bands like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, You Am I, Gerling, Decoder Ring, Tumbleweed, Rocket Science, The Avalacnches, Beck, Trans Am, The John Spencer Blues Explosion, SPOD when they played in Sydney and they were a huge inspiration. We would go home straight away and start jamming and wake the neighbours up.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the music scene like in Australia?</strong>  <br>
It&apos;s cool, it&apos;s obviously a lot smaller but there are some great bands like Cut Copy, The Presets, The Midnight Juggernauts, Wolf &amp; Cub, Gerling, SPOD, etc. Melbourne and Sydney have good scenes. We go out, we have a good time.</p>

<p><strong>You recently played New York, what&apos;s your take on its&apos; music scene?</strong>  <br>
It&apos;s hard for us to really know, It&apos;s such a big place, we&apos;d have to spend more time there, there is so much stuff going on. We are never in town for more than a couple of nights, but we have a ball whenever we are in town. We went to the Rolling Stone magazine party and saw the Strokes play they are fantastic, Lou Reed and Eddie Vedder got up and played with them. It was cool.</p>

<p><strong>Any favorite hangouts when in New York City?</strong>  <br>
No favourites yet, I love hanging out in New York in general. We always have breakfast at Cafe Habana when we can.</p>
