										<p>If you watch <em>Portlandia</em>, you&apos;ve probably seen some parallels between the Oregon-centric show and our very own, precious Brooklyn. And now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623132128/http://www.brokelyn.com/welcome-to-brokelandia-did-you-eat-it/">Brokelyn</a> has started their own series, called <em>Brokelandia</em>, which brings us a Brooklyn-based version of the IFC show. The first one, below, is all about the food, with the characters discussing the borough&apos;s finer dining experiences&#x2014;from Do or Dine&apos;s fois gras doughnut, to Dun-Well Doughnuts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160623132128/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/09/a_faux_vs_foie_gras_doughnut_taste-.php">vegan faux gras doughnut</a> (&quot;I thought it needed more meat&quot;), to that pumpkin off of Steve Buscemi&apos;s stoop.</p>
