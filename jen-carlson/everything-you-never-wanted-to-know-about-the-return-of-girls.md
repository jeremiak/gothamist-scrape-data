<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="dunhamglover0113.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309070840im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/dunhamglover0113.jpeg" width="275" height="380" class="image-right"> </span>In the second episode of <em>Girls</em>&apos; season two, there&apos;s one scene in which it seems clear that Lena Dunham, speaking through her character Hannah Horvath, is having a conversation with her critics. &quot;I don&apos;t live in a world with [racial] divisions like that,&quot; she declares, in a not-so-subtle reference to the backlash against the show&apos;s first season. Some viewers criticized Dunham for excluding minorities from her twenty-something version of New York City, and in season two&#x2014;which starts this Sunday&#x2014;she finally gets to respond on screen, almost immediately. Not even three minutes into the season two opener, Dunham&apos;s character is naked and straddling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309070840/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/donald_glover_comedian_1.php">Donald Glover</a>, a black actor.</p>

<p>If season one started setting up the foundation of Hannah Horvath&apos;s world, season two is breaking it all apart. Without giving much away, here are some observations from the first few episodes. I watched these about a week ago with a few girlfriends and more than a few glasses of whiskey&#x2014;these are some of the thoughts that remain:</p>

<ul><li>Charlie has ditched his good boy smile for a gruff, bearded smirk. And the new demeanor isn&apos;t just for the screen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309070840/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/10/inside_the_girls_season_2_premiere.php#photo-9">at the party earlier this week</a>, we spotted Christopher Abbott looking tired, broken, and depressed... which obviously made us much more attracted to him. Assuming he&apos;s okay: hoorah! Sad Charlie is hot.
</li><li>Lena Dunham gets naked or <em>basically</em> naked three times in episode one alone. This is a great thing&#x2014;first of all: why not? Secondly, Dunham isn&apos;t a size 0, so she is helping many young women climb out of the self conscious pitfall they&apos;ve fallen in to. But if you are on the shallow side and feel something negative rising up your throat as a reaction to this, please read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309070840/http://jezebel.com/5973929/ny-post-critic-writes-nuanced-review-of-lena-dunhams-blobby-body">that Linda Stasi piece of vitriolic garbage</a> and ask yourself: &quot;Is this the kind of person <em>I</em> want to be?&quot;
</li><li>There is one reference to Ayn Rand&apos;s <em>The Fountainhead</em> (in regards to Glover&apos;s character&apos;s right wing tendencies), but it&apos;s fleeting, just like any 20-something&apos;s interest in that book.
</li><li>Shoshanna needs to CHILL. THE FUCK. OUT. Zosia Mamet is taking that character into some new orbit of over-the-toppism. Hopefully an Ambien addiction is on the horizon for her sometime this season because O-M-EFFING-G she has become a zany caricature of her season one self.
</li><li>Prepare for a Duncan Sheik comeback! Or at least prepare to have this song burned into your brain crevices so hard and so deep that you end up loving it in like a cultish <em>&quot;I didn&apos;t mean for this to happen&quot;</em> way&#x2014;so much that you pry your eyelids open with toothpicks or tape or whatever&apos;s laying around at the end of the night just so you can keep listening to it <em>forever</em>.</li></ul>
