<p>In 1950, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054102/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/new-on-the-road-6/">Modern Mechanix</a> took a look at what was new on the road, from de-icing fluid for windshields to this amazing &quot;Bed Bike.&quot; </p>

<p>The Bed Bike never seemed to catch on (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054102/http://www.google.com/patents/EP1200303B1?cl=en"><em>or did it?</em></a>), but in their write-up they note it &quot;will appeal especially to lazy cyclists&#x2014;those who like to lie down on the job.&quot; It featured &quot;two comfortable sponge rubber &apos;seats&apos; and pedals in the rear.&quot; We have a lot of logistical and safety questions about this thing, but sadly there is little information online.</p>

<p>Another invention they featured in the issue was a lightweight motorcycle that the owner could simply carry around. &quot;Minibyke can solve your motorcycle parking problems. Just pick it up, tuck it under your arm.&quot; The bike was touted for being able to fit into small spaces&#x2014;smaller than the small spaces the typical motorcycle could fit in&#x2014;and &quot;only&quot; weighing 90 pounds.</p>

<p>While carrying around a 90-pound motorcycle and cycling while lying down may seem idiotic at best, nothing beats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054102/http://www.conferencebike.com/">The Conference Bike</a>, which was invented by more modern brains.</p>
