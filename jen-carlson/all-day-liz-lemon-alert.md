<p><em>30 Rock</em> rarely films <em>at</em> 30 Rock&#x2014;typically they&apos;re at Silvercup Studios in Queens&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301115326/http://pulsd.com/new-york/5/rockefeller-center/see-30-rock-at-30-rock">we hear</a> today they&apos;ll be at the Midtown location (possibly with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301115326/http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/Susan_Sarandon_to_Guest_Star_on_30_ROCK_20110225">Susan Sarandon</a>) from 10 a.m. through 8 p.m. for an all-day shoot. Or an all-day Liz Lemon party, whichever way you want to think of it.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, <em>New Year&#x2019;s Eve</em>, the unnecessary follow-up to <em>Valentine&#x2019;s Day</em>, will be filming at and around Radio City Music Hall. And <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> is at the Brooklyn Navy yard; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301115326/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/boardwalk_empire_filming_at_gage_to.php">last week</a> they were bringing the old Gage &amp; Tollner back to life, but only the interior (as shown by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301115326/http://www.flickr.com/photos/bettyblade/5474709208/">this exterior photo</a> taken during the shoot).</p>
