The bridge was likely put up to deal with construction, and one commenter on the site noted, &quot;It&#x2019;s very possible the bridge was built during construction of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317224537/http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/historyindependentsubway.html">the new Independent subway</a> which crosses 5th Ave at 53rd St.&quot; (The line was conceived in 1920 to deal with severe overcrowding on the subways.)</p>
