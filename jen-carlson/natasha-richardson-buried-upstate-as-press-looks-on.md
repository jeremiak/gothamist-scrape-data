<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045603/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/03/22/arts/AP-Natasha-Richardson-Funeral.html">The NY Times</a> now reports on the final farewell, which took place yesterday 80 miles north of here in Upstate New York, where she and her family had a home. Liam Neeson was one of the six pallbearers, where he carried his wife&apos;s coffin into the same church they were married at in 1994, St. Peter&apos;s Episcopal. Those in attendance included the couple&apos;s two sons, Richardson&apos;s mother Vanessa Redgrave, her sister Joely Richardson, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Uma Thurman and Timothy Dalton. </p>

<p>Her grave sits near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045603/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/03/22/2009-03-22_actress_natasha_richardson_laid_to_rest_.html">that of her maternal grandmother</a>, actress Rachel Kempson, who the Times reports died while visiting Richardson and Neeson in 2003. On Friday a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045603/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/20/natasha_richardsons_private_wake_pu.php">private viewing</a> took place at the American Irish Historical Society, where Diane Sawyer, Ethan Hawke and Sarah Jessica Parker were amongst those who came to pay their respects. </p>

<p>And while the press has been uninvited guests to each grieving moment, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045603/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7958315.stm">filming the coffin</a> being carried into the church, the family has graciously taken time to wave to the cameras throughout their difficult week.</p>
