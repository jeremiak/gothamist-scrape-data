</div></div>					<p>A new set of old photos has been unearthed and digitized (hat tip to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150714025312/http://forgotten-ny.com/">Forgotten NY</a> for alerting us). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150714025312/http://viewoftheblue.com/artphotos/">man behind the lens </a>writes: &quot;I have first added photo galleries made from scans of color slides taken from August, 1978 to May, 1980. These represent all the noteworthy shots I have on slides. In the future, I will be scanning my color negative collection, which is a lot more vast, spanning from late 1974 to recent years.&quot; He&apos;s captured everything from rollerskaters on Midtown sidewalks to BBQs in Woodhaven... Enjoy!</p>
