										<p>Earlier today thrillseeker/activist Alain Robert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529150151/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/breaking_someon.php">scaled the NY Times Building</a> in order to draw attention to the Global Warming threat. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529150151/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/man-scales-new-york-times-building/">He reportedly</a> climbed 52 floors, to the roof, before being detained by police around 12:30 p.m. He did so without the aid of any climbing instruments (except his shoes) and sans the safety of a parachute strapped to his back. </p>

<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529150151/http://thesolutionissimple.org/">his website</a>, the URL of which adorned his t-shirt, he stated:</p><blockquote>Today is World Environment Day. I have climbed in New York, as a peaceful way to create support for far greater and urgent action from world leaders on global warming. Emissions are still climbing. So am I.</blockquote>If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529150151/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/05/jeb.php">Jeb Corliss&apos;s case</a> is any indication, Robert will likely face reckless endangerment charges. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529150151/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">Email us</a> any photos you have from the scene for the below gallery. <p></p>

<p><b>Update, 6/5</b>: Another man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529150151/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/06/all_the_news_bu.php">scaled the NY Times building six hours</a> after Robert did!  Renaldo Clarke, an IT consultant who wanted to bring attention to malaria, was successful in his climb, though onlookers thought he wasn&apos;t as conditioned or prepared at Robert.</p>
