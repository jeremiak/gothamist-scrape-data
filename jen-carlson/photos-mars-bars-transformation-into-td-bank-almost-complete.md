<p>It was with almost impressive swiftness that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163512/http://gothamist.com/tags/marsbar">Mars Bar</a> was demolished to make way for a luxury apartment building (albeit, one with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163512/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/here_are_the_10_east_village_apartm.php#photo-1">$10 apartments</a>)&#x2014;as if the developer purposefully took the ripping-the-Band-Aid-off approach. And now that transformation is about to fully metastasize, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163512/http://evgrieve.com/2014/02/the-fucking-td-bank-signage-arrives-at.html">TD Bank signage</a> going up on the sacred spirits-soaked ground which the emblematic drinking institution used to call home. Thanks to the Old New York aesthetic the place had&#x2014;looking almost as if it were a monument to the Bad Old Days recreated for a movie&#x2014;the side-by-side comparison showing how that corner looked just a few years ago versus today is jarring.</p>

<p>At least Mars Bar still lives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163512/https://www.google.com/maps/@40.724212,-73.990844,3a,75y,268.02h,91.6t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sVu47x0j0W-tCuNqG6oFM4Q!2e0!6m1!1e1">on Google Street View</a>, until a robot car drives by to capture the new look of Our Future. After that, we&apos;ll just be left with Jonas Mekas&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163512/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/mars_bar_the_movie_proves_that_the.php">Mars Bar movie</a>:</p>
