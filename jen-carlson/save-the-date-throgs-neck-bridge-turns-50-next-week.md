<p>The Throgs Neck Bridge is definitely not one of New York&apos;s most celebrated bridges... but this photo its publicist sent over is pretty neat! The suspension bridge opened on January 11th, 1961, and it connects the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx with the Bay Terrace section of Queens. It&apos;s the newest bridge on the East River, and will be turning 50 years young next Tuesday. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085818/http://www.mta.info/news/stories/?story=174">According to the MTA</a>, Robert Moses had &quot;pushed to have the bridge open before the opening of the 1964 World&apos;s Fair, of which he was also the president. About 20 minutes after the ribbon cutting, the dignitaries sped across the new Throgs Neck Bridge for the second ceremony of the day&#x2014;the dedication of the first World&apos;s Fair structure at Flushing Meadow Park.&quot; They make no mention of a celebration of fireworks, like that fat cat the Brooklyn Bridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085818/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/14/5_day_celebrati.php">always gets</a>, so wherever you are next Tuesday, raise a glass to the poor bastard.</p>
