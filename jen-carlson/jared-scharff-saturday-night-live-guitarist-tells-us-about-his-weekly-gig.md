A few years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123224152/https://twitter.com/ScharffIsHere">Jared Blake Scharff</a> became the band&apos;s newest member. At the age of 32, Scharff has accomplished plenty while off of that legendary stage as well&#x2014;he&apos;s played alongside the likes of Bruce Springsteen at Carnegie Hall, and is a highly in-demand studio musician. Below he tells us how he landed the SNL dream gig, what his experience there has been like, and other highlights of his career so far... plus, what happens at the after-after party.</em></p>

<p><strong>So I think we have a connection&#x2014;did you go to &quot;band camp&quot; with Brian Anderson and some of the Maroon 5 guys?</strong> I went to French Woods Festival for the Performing Arts sleepaway camp where Brian, Adam Levine, and Jessie Carmichael all went. I played in bands with Adam and Jessie, as well as Brian since I was 10 or 11 years old. Adam was in the first rock band I ever played in! I was playing drums at the time and we played Metallica&#x2019;s version of Queen&#x2019;s &#x201C;Stone Cold Crazy&#x201D; and Van Halen&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ice Cream Man&#x201D;.</p>

<p><strong>And you remain friends today?</strong> They are all super awesome guys and when they are playing in town I try to link up when possible. Love when they come to SNL and we get to hang where we are both playing on our respective gigs. It&#x2019;s like, &#x201C;Hey&#x2026;look at us, we rocked when we were kids, and holy shit&#x2026;it&#x2019;s our job now!&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Did you want to pursue a music career from a young age?</strong> When I started going to French Woods, I was really consumed with playing music. I played guitar and drums every day and loved every minute of it. Eventually, a few years later, my dad took me to my first Allman Brothers Band concert at the Beacon Theatre. I was a freshmen in high school and the time. It was there that I knew this would be my calling for the rest of my life.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get the SNL gig?</strong> I was recommended by the previous guitarist Dr. Luke (now the biggest pop hitmaker in the world). I knew him for years and he thought I would be a good candidate for it. Lenny Pickett, the bandleader, checked out some YouTube links I had sent him and then we had an official meeting. That turned into a 3 hour hang/talk/audition. I got a call back after that to play with the entire SNL Rhythm section. At this point, there were just 4 guitarists (myself included) in the running. Got the call a few weeks later, and the rest is history.</p>

<p><strong>How often are you at the studio and rehearsing there each week?</strong> I am typically there only on Saturdays. However, there are a lot of show weeks where I have to play guitar during a sketch, or even record some guitar for sketch music. If that happens I&#x2019;ll show up on Thursday or Friday, whenever they need me. I am on call all day Thursday and Friday basically.</p>

<p><strong>Who has been your favorite host since you&apos;ve been in the band?</strong> Some of my all time favorite hosts have been Alec Baldwin, Will Ferrell and John Malkovich. There have been a ton of amazing hosts and musical guests, but after a while it gets really difficult to remember due to the sheer number of shows I have witnessed. This is my 6th season so it gets a little fuzzy. Obviously, for me, the musical guests are what get me the most excited.</p>

<p><strong>Who have been some of your favorite musical guests?</strong> Highlights would def have been playing onstage with Mick Jagger/Jeff Beck at last year&#x2019;s season finale. Also seeing Tom Petty, Paul McCartney,U2, etc. Whenever the legends come, it&#x2019;s special. Sometimes the guest band might play 2 or 3 songs as the credits roll. That&#x2019;s definitely a &#x201C;pinch me&#x201D; moment when those guys are on the stage next to me rocking out, as I&#x2019;m putting my guitar away after the show. It&#x2019;s like, &#x201C;What is happening right now?!?&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Who would you like to see as host/musical guest?</strong> Would love to see Tom Cruise host. I think some of his wacky characters (TJ Mackey in <em>Magnolia</em>, etc) would be amazing. As far as musical guest, I&#x2019;d say Sigur Ros, the Who, Skrillex, Guns n&apos; Roses (with Axl and Slash!).</p>

<p><strong>What happens at the after party, and the after <em>after</em> party?</strong> If I told you, I would have to kill you. Just kidding. The first party is more of a dinner/wind-down. Tables are set up for cast members, writers, producers, band, guest band, host, etc. Everyone just unwinds after a long and grueling week. It&#x2019;s at a different location every week. It&#x2019;s a great way to come off of a show. The after after is more of a bar hang.</p>

<p><strong>You have a music career beyond the SNL stage, can you get into that&#x2014;what else are you doing now?</strong> I spend my days producing/writing music. Have done some great rock bands, urban pop, rap/pop, pop, etc. Some major label stuff, some song pitches, some indie artists, so I stay pretty busy with all of that. I am also working on my first instrumental EP, which I&#x2019;m super stoked about that.</p>

<p><strong>What have been some of your personal highlights, musically?</strong> I think my first major highlight was playing at Madison Square Garden for the Pete Seeger 90th birthday Charity event. I had seen so many concerts at MSG and there I was onstage. Very surreal moment for me. Also, another highlight is being a part of the house band for Sting and Trudie&#x2019;s Rainforest benefit concert at Carnegie Hall. I have done it twice so far and every time it brings in some really amazing talent to the show. Got to play with Sting, Elton John, Lady Gaga, Debbie Harry, Bruce Springsteen, Bruno Mars, etc. It&#x2019;s been unreal. I am very fortunate to get to work with such incredible talent, and continue to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you listening to right now?</strong> Loving the new Kanye record and I just downloaded (paid of course) some of the new Taylor Swift, Nero, Swedish House Mafia, Bruno Mars, Fun., etc . I listen to everything. Music junkie.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any favorite NYC venues (to play, or to see shows)?</strong> I love Rockwood Music Hall. It&#x2019;s like the &#x201C;Cheers&#x201D; of NYC for musicians.</p>
