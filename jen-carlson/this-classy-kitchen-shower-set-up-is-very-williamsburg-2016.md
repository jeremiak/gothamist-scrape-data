title: This Classy Kitchen Shower Set-Up Is Very Williamsburg 2016
---

	
										<p>Remember when bathtubs in kitchens were old behemoths coated in the grit of eras past? When you&apos;d walk in and see the bathtub shooting up in its clawfoot? When you&apos;d come home to find police tape wrapped around your kitchen shower curtain? Those days are over, friend. Luxury kitchen showers have taken over, and they&apos;ve never even stabbed a man.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020084125/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/tubchen_apartment.php">This Williamsburg apartment</a> is going for $1950/month, and features all the normal apartment things, along with this sleek kitchen shower. It&apos;s the kitchen shower New Williamsburg deserves.</p>

<p>And it sits directly across from the fridge, which is very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020084125/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15puo-dSEIY">Kramer-inspired</a>.</p>

<p>Luckily, we still have romantic comedies featuring young women moving to Manhattan for the first time, and emptying out their sock money for a shoddy pad with a cinematically perfect clawfoot right there in the kitchen. Just like the good ol&apos; days.</p>
