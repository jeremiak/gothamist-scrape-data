According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071601/http://www.alwayshungryny.com/thought-for-food/entry/alwaysinformed-bacon-donuts-now-at-wildwood-bbq">Always Hungry NY</a>, chef &#x201C;Big Lou&#x201D; Elrose has announced a new menu item: Cinnamon Donuts topped with Candied Bacon... and served with homemade coffee ice cream. The dish (pictured) features &quot;two airy, cinnamon-rich cake donuts, that are good (though not Doughnut Plant good)... top-coated in a frosting-like glaze that is sprinkled with chewy, salty-sweet bacon bits.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071601/http://www.matthewbarr.co.uk/sounds/donuts_cant_do.wav">Take it away, Homer</a>. </p>
