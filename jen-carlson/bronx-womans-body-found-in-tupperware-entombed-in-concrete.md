title: Bronx Woman's Body Found in Tupperware, Entombed in Concrete
---

<p>The police suspect 32-year-old Bronx resident, Julio Rolando Flores, has killed and dismembered his 28-year-old ex-girlfriend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115818/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/nyregion/15concrete.html">The NY Times</a> reports. The details get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115818/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/womans-body-parts-found-in-new-jersey-bronx-crime/">more gruesome</a>, however, as her body parts were placed in tupperware containers and entombed in concrete at a construction site in Teaneck, New Jersey, where authorities found the man covered in cement yesterday. Earlier in the day the family of the girl, Jaritza Calderone, received a call from Flores saying they would never see her again--prompting them to call the NYPD. Yesterday, &quot;the owner of the home in Teaneck, where Mr. Flores had been working, saw him acting suspiciously and called 911.&quot; NJ authorities took action when they saw the NYPD had placed an alert on his vehicle. Calderone was last heard from the night before when she was heading to Flores&apos;s apartment to retrieve her belongings. And Flores has already &quot;made statements implicating himself in Ms. Calderone&#x2019;s disappearance and death.&quot;</p>
