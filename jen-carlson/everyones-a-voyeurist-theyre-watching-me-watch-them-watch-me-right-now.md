<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425000326/http://hbovoyeur.com/">HBOVoyeur</a> launched last week on a previously barren wall in the Lower East Side. The projection on the wall shows a film that tears down the facade of an apartment building and lets any passerby take a peak inside (HBO definitely picked the right city for this, as similar real-life scenes can seen from the street 24/7 here). The idea is a cool one, but can get old fast while watching it - which is why they keep the vignettes short. The pamphlet we picked up describes it as:

</p><blockquote>&quot;a multimedia experience that gives you a peek into what happens behind the countless windows we pass everyday. It begins with a silent film projected on the side of a building, and extends online and to HBO on Demand. The project illustrates the underlying truth that sometimes the most revealing stories are the ones you weren&apos;t meant to see.&quot; </blockquote>

<p>This is something we all learned while watching the first season of <em>The Real World</em> (but probably forgot sometime around <em>Big Brother</em>, <em>The Bachelor</em> and every other &quot;reality show&quot; that quickly sprouted up). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425000326/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/06/hbovoyeur_short_cuts.html">NYMag </a>has a review from the premiere, where apparently &quot;covetable gift bags&quot; were handed out (we hear they contained iPods...but not iPhones). </p>

<p>To watch the project live, head over to Broome and Ludlow Streets. </p>
