<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="biebs0623.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062157im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/biebs0623.jpg" width="310" height="300" class="image-right"> </span>Superstar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062157/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">Justin Bieber</a>&#x2014;who is now officially an adult (did you read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062157/http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201206/justin-bieber-gq-june-2012-interview">that GQ profile</a> yet?)&#x2014;suffered a concussion yesterday after walking into a glass wall in Paris. <em>WHY GOD?</em> The impact occurred during a performance there, and was enough to make him faint. He was later diagnosed with the mild concussion, but is now recovering with just &quot;a little bit of a headache.&quot;</p>

<p>The Biebs told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062157/http://www.tmz.com/2012/05/31/justin-bieber-knocked-out-cold-paris-concert-concussion-glass-wall/?adid=hero1">TMZ</a>, &quot;So basically, um, you know&#x2026; there [was] a glass wall behind me but there&apos;s a railing behind the glass. And so, um, I went to reach for the railing and hit my head on the glass.&quot; He added, &quot;I guess me and glass windows just don&apos;t go together&quot; (blame <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604062157/http://www.luckymag.com/blogs/luckyrightnow/2012/05/Rihanna-and-Justin-Bieber-Bangs-Health-Hazard">the old bangs</a>?) referring to his prior run-in with his transparent nemesis&#x2014;he later Tweeted, &quot;I will see u again Glass. I will have my revenge.&quot;</p>

<p>The below video is from when Bieber walked into a glass door back in 2010&#x2014;which is particularly amusing because of how he has to throw his whole body into pushing the door.</p>
