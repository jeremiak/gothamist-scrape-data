title: Here Are The NYC Bars & Restaurants Featured In 'Master Of None' Season Two
---

	
										<p>Aziz Ansari has brought his love for food back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627073528/http://gothamist.com/tags/masterofnone"><em>Master of None</em></a>&apos;s second season, which starts off in one of the biggest culinary capitals of the world, Italy, before settling back into New York. And since Ansari&apos;s passion for food is very real, New York&apos;s real life food scene becomes more than a background player in the series&#x2014;nearly every episode features a tip or two on where to go, and what to order. Here&apos;s a rundown of the places you&apos;ll see in season two, which hits Netflix on Friday (May 12th).</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="MONRAMEN17.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627073528im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/MONRAMEN17.jpeg" width="640" height="408" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">Broth-less ramen at Yuji Ramen. (Screenshot from &apos;Master of None&apos;)</span></p>

<p><strong>OKONOMI // YUJI RAMEN</strong>, 150 Ainslie St #2 (&#x2028;btw Leonard St &amp; Lorimer St in Williamsburg). In the show they order the mazemen ramen, which is broth-less. The restaurant&apos;s GM George Padilla told us: &quot;That is the Bacon &amp; Egg mazemen served under the restaurant name &apos;YUJI Ramen.&apos; OKONOMI is the name of the restaurant during the daytime, for serving Japanese breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>LOS TACOS NO. 1</strong>, located in Chelsea Market. Ansari&apos;s character, Dev, doesn&apos;t go here in the show, but he does mention it, saying they have <em>the</em> best tacos in NYC (and recommending the al pastor). </p>

<p><strong>THAI VILLA</strong>, 5 E 19th Street (btw 5th &amp; Broadway). Dev orders the special on the menu: Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli.</p>

<p><strong>WESTLIGHT AT WILLIAM VALE</strong>, 111 N 12th Street (btw Berry &amp; Wythe in Williamsburg). Some of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627073528/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/29/westlight_rooftop_william_vale.php">the best views in town</a>, the roof is used as a later-night date spot in the show.</p>

<p><strong>LUCKY&apos;S FAMOUS BURGERS</strong>, 264 W 23rd Street (btw 7th &amp; 8th). The spot serves as a late night hang for some characters outside of Dev&apos;s world. </p>

<p><strong>1 OAK</strong>, 453 W 17th St (btw 9th &amp; 10th Aves). This is where the aforementioned characters attempt to go prior to landing at Lucky&apos;s.</p>

<p><strong>JIA AT HOTEL ON RIVINGTON</strong>, 105 Rivington St (btw Ludlow &amp; Essex). This is a lovely lounge with lots of floral patterns, but unless you like bottle-service crowds you probably never want to go here.</p>

<p><strong>SMORGASBURG</strong>. On the show they are at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627073528/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/02/photos_smorgasburg_2017.php#photo-1">East River State Park location</a>, for a special Hog Wild Weekend featuring food from Tickler&apos;s. This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627073528/https://www.wannadolocal.com/nashville/blog/what-master-of-none-got-right-and-wrong-about-nashville">a fictional BBQ spot</a> from Nashville which also turned up in season one (when it was filmed at Hometown BBQ in Red Hook).</p>
