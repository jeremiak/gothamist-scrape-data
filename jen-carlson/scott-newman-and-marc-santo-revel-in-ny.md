										<p><em>We&apos;ve posted videos here from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027162806/http://www.revelinnewyork.com/">Revel In New York</a> before, and we thought it was finally time to talk to the two people behind it: Scott and Marc. What better way to get to know them, then through their own work. They just posted their latest video, with Lorie Karnath &#x2014; president of The Explorers Club, a private club that began in Manhattan in 1904. Be sure to click around and check out their other profiles of New Yorkers as well &#x2014;&#xA0;all well worth the watch. And below, get to know the men behind the lens a bit better.</em> </p>

<p><strong>When and why did you start Revel? Scott:</strong> We started shooting stories for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027162806/http://revelinnewyork.com/">Revel in New York</a> about a year ago, and the site launched this past August. Having lived here for so long and grown up around the city we felt that there were too many interesting people and subcultures here, that we had to document it.</p>

<p><strong>Marc:</strong> I had been working in television and was getting frustrated with the lack of good ideas that actually make it to the screen.  There are some really great ideas that people come up with, yet with a mass and very mainstream audience, the safest and unfortunately a lot of the weaker ones are the shows that we actually get to see. We like the idea that on the internet you don&#x2019;t have to stick to a formula and you can produce content relatively cheaply.  We set out to make something entertaining that also provides practical information.  So we came up with a video based city guide.</p>

<p><strong>S:</strong> It&#x2019;s a work in progress and we&#x2019;re just starting to figure it out.</p>
