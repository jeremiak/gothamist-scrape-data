<p>Last week 2,000 invisible animal lovers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210803/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/28/invisible_dog_walk.php">came together in Cobble Hill</a> to talk to walk their invisible dogs and simultaneously confuse onlookers. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210803/http://improveverywhere.com/2009/10/04/invisible-dogs/">there&apos;s video</a> so you can fully experience the reaction of the neighborhood locals:</p>
