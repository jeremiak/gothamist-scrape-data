<p>It isn&apos;t surprising that a raccoon was discovered inside of the Brooklyn Public Library, it was probably trying to escape <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063550/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/24/swan_1.php">certain death</a> in Prospect Park! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063550/http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/157095">WNYC reports</a> that the animal was recently spotted in the basement by the library&apos;s maintenance crew, and the area has been shut down to staff since Friday. Since that time, Animal Care and Control has come in, and the library brought in a private pest service to put down traps, but the little guy hasn&apos;t been seen since!</p>

<p>The storage space the raccoon was found rummaging in houses the library&apos;s surplus books and canisters of microfilm, meaning staff has not been unable to retrieve items stored there for patrons. Spokeswoman Malika Granville says they closed off the section to &quot;minimize contact between humans and animals,&quot; but it will reopen later this week after an animal control expert gives them the all clear. Still, you might want to watch out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063550/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/07/raccoon_bites_woman_in_central_park.php">for your ankles</a>, library card holders.</p>
