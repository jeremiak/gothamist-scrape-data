										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpAuOA8ePM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041026im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpAuOA8ePM.jpg" width="185" height="300" class="image-left"> </span>Over the weekend Patti Smith and Jonathan Lethem went face-to-face in the Great Hall of Cooper Union to discuss, you know, stuff. The Q&amp;A; format had Smith on the receiving end of questions from the author as well as some audience members. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041026/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2010/05/find-new-city.html">VanshingNY</a>, one woman asked if it was still possible for a young artist to come to New York City and find a similar path that Smith and her contemporaries found themselves on decades ago. </p>

<p>The Godmother of Punk recalled coming to New York in 1967 when she was broke and the city was &quot;&apos;down and out,&apos; and you could get a cheap apartment and &apos;build a whole community of transvestites or artists or writers.&apos;&quot; But today, she says, <strong>&quot;New York has closed itself off to the young and the struggling. But there are other cities. Detroit. Poughkeepsie. New York City has been taken away from you. So my advice is: Find a new city.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>And with that, we&apos;re now living in a world where Patti Smith and Sarah Jessica Parker are pretty much telling us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041026/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/sjp_warns_futur.php">the same thing</a>. Heavy.</p>
