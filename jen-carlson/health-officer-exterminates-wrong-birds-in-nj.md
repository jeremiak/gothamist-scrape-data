F. Hoving who dubbed pigeons &quot;rats with wings,&quot; a term that fourteen years later was popularized by Woody Allen in his 1980 flick &#x201C;Stardust Memories.&#x201D; So surely there&apos;s some blood on their hands in the war on the pigeon community in New York (only recently was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154710/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/13/pigeon_day.php">National Pigeon Day</a> established to combat the haters).</p>

<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of pigeons around though, and everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154710/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/16/robotic_hawk.php">Robo-Hawk to Pigeon Czars</a> have been considered in controlling the population, but it&apos;s sort of rare that we hear the words &quot;pigeon extermination.&quot; Turns out some folks across the Hudson (specifically, Fort Lee Health Officer Steven Wielkotz) turned to the chemical Avitrol &quot;to get rid of more than 100 pigeons that descended on the area around town hall two months ago,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154710/http://www.wcbs880.com/pages/5746667.php">according to WCBS</a>. Avitrol, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154710/http://pigeonpolitics.blogspot.com/2008/04/pest-control-industry-misrepresents.html">by the way</a>, &quot;kills the pigeons by first causing them to suffer seizures and then cardiac arrest.&quot; </p>

<p>Wielkotz&apos;s master plan to wipe out the pigeons didn&apos;t quite go as planned, however, because the grackles ate the seed instead. 30 of those birds have since died&#x2014;and Mayor Mark Sokolich says children were seen trying to save the dying birds.</p>
