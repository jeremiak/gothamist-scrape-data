</div></div>
                            <p>Yesterday, we stopped by the most Brooklyn place in all of Brooklyn: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106055102/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255913/"><em>Bored to Death</em></a> set, which is actually the least Brooklyn place in all of the show. It&apos;s set up at Steiner Studios in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and inside you&apos;ll find&#x2014;amongst other things&#x2014;the West Village apartment of George Christopher (played by Ted Danson). In the upcoming third season, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106055102/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/12/jonathan_ames_writer.php">Jonathan Ames</a> &amp; Co. are filming now, you&apos;ll find that George has opened a restaurant on Jane Street called George on Jane, and has moved to an apartment above his new venture. (You can see photos of the envy-inducing, albeit fake, piece of real estate in the gallery above.) We sat down to talk with the real Jonathan Ames, and the show&apos;s &quot;Jonathan Ames,&quot; played by the incredibly kind and charming Jason Schwartzman&#x2014;who started things off with this linguistic time stamp: &quot;Let&apos;s note that this interview is being shot and recorded on a vintage Flip cam. It&apos;s kind of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106055102/http://www.npr.org/2011/04/13/135369923/smartphones-helped-to-kill-flip-camera">a collector&apos;s item</a>.&quot; Here&apos;s what we learned:</p>

<p><strong>On fictional Brooklyn real estate:</strong> Schwartzman&apos;s character in the show has also moved, and that big clock you&apos;ll see in the above gallery has something to do with his new digs (it&apos;s a replica of the Williamsburg Savings Bank clock!). </p>

<p><strong>On Ted Danson and fictional restaurants:</strong> Ted Danson&apos;s role as a restaurant owner in the new Adam Yauch-directed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106055102/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/video_beastie_boys.php">Beastie Boys short</a> has nothing to do with his new role as restaurant owner on the show. Ames tells us, &quot;I heard about this video because Jason and Ted are both in it, but I didn&apos;t know that there was anything about opening a restaurant with Ted Danson in it. Just... in the zeitgeist!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>On what&apos;s happening with season three:</strong> &quot;It&apos;s a year later. Jonathan continues to be a detective. His cases... some of them are more dangerous than ever. George at the end of season two has quit his job at the magazine and he mentions that maybe he&apos;d open a restaurant, so he opens an artisinal, organic restaurant in Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>On being cultural representatives of Brooklyn:</strong> Ames says, &quot;I was on the subway one day, and this realtor introduced himself to me. Very nice older man. He said, &quot;I love your show, and just so you know, when I show different neighborhoods to clients I say &apos;This is a Bored to Death&apos; neighborhood.&quot; I got a kick out of that. <em>Welcome Back Kotter</em>, early on, I kind of remember there would be this big sign &apos;Brooklyn: The 5th Largest City in the World&apos; or something like that. Brooklyn is enormous and varied. I mean, yeah I don&apos;t think any other TV show is really showing Brooklyn at the moment. I don&apos;t know that we&apos;re the cultural representative of it, but we&apos;re culturally presenting it. We&apos;re one of many different groups of artists presenting Brooklyn.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>On the real Jonathan Ames vs. the fake Jonathan Ames:</strong> <strong>JA:</strong> It&apos;s good that you don&apos;t portray me. How can you portray someone who&apos;s boring?<br>
<strong>JS:</strong> You&apos;re not boring.<br>
<strong>JA:</strong> Well as a portrayal. I&apos;m a boring person. I&apos;m boring right now. <br>
<strong>JS:</strong> Let&apos;s not go there. Now now, musn&apos;t go there, musn&apos;t go there!</p>

<p>Currently there&apos;s no air date for the first episode of season 3, but the show will be returning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106055102/http://www.hbo.com/bored-to-death/index.html">to HBO</a> <em>sometime</em> this year (most likely September).</p>
