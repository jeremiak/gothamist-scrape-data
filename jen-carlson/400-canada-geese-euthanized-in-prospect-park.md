<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529125551/http://gothamist.com/tags/prospectparklake">Prospect Park</a> has seen its share of animal deaths this year, but the latest was planned and carried out by the United States Department of Agriculture. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529125551/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/officials-euthanize-nearly-400-geese-from-prospect-park/">CityRoom</a>, four hundred Canada geese were captured and euthanized last week in an ongoing effort to curb the population of winged terrors.</p>

<p>The birds were captured in crates by wildlife biologists and technicians last Thursday morning, and then taken to a facility where they were gassed with lethal doses of carbon dioxide. The geese have been in molting season, which means they were unable to fly and easy to catch.</p>

<p>In the future expect more of these feathered fliers to meet the same end, as the plan is to remove all Canada geese within seven miles of both JFK and LaGaurdia... except those living <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529125551/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/28/canada_geese.php">in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge</a> (they&apos;re safe, <em>for now</em>). Reportedly this morning only four geese were spotted in the park, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529125551/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/21/target_the_goose_is_okay.php">Target</a> was nowhere to be found :(</p>
