<p>You know what New York City probably doesn&apos;t need? A vending machine that supplies pizza. It&apos;s unclear whether <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118043033/http://www.letspizza.co.uk/home.html">the &quot;Let&apos;s Pizza&quot; machine</a> will be arriving <em>here</em> soon, but it <em>is</em> coming to the States after a successful run in the UK. (Please note: this is not to be confused with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118043033/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/video_pizza_vending_machine_bakes_p.php">the Pizzametry machine</a>. Totally different!)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118043033/http://designtaxi.com/news/352764/Pizza-Vending-Machines-To-Debut-In-The-US/">Design Taxi</a>, the pizza vending machines will be hitting U.S. streets this summer, making &quot;fresh pizzas from scratch on the spot, (even the dough is freshly-made) as soon as you pay and order it.&quot; The process takes three minutes.</p>

<p>According to the CEO of A1 Concepts (they distribute the machines), &#x201C;The machine contains a specially developed bag of flour and a bag of mineral water.&quot; (But is it Brooklyn water?) &quot;Every time you order a pizza, the machine will start making the dough, then shape it into a crust, and top it with organic tomato sauce. Next, one of the toppings is placed on top and the pizza is ready for the oven.&#x201D; The toppings range from vegetables to fish (we&apos;d be careful with that one).</p>

<p>Each pizza will cost just under $6 for a 10.5-inch pizza, and will be found in airports, universities, hotels, and other places where you&apos;re desperate for food-like options and short on dignity. Eh, we still think we like that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150118043033/http://laist.com/2012/02/28/sprinkles_announces_24-hour-cupcake.php">cupcake ATM</a> more...</p>
