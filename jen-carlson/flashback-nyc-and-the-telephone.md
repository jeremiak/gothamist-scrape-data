</div></div><p>On March 3rd, 1885, the American Telephone and Telegraph (yep, that&apos;s AT&amp;T;) was incorporated in New York as a subsidiary of the American Bell Telephone Company. Exactly 126 years later and here we are, complaining about AT&amp;T; because we can&apos;t check in to a bar on Foursquare fast enough, or Tweet our white girl problems from the line at Barneys warehouse sale because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163056/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/28/att_admits_new_york_city_3g_service.php">service sucks</a> so badly. </p>

<p>Well, just take a look back at New York City&apos;s history with the telephone, and you&apos;ll probably feel a little bit better about the current situation... or maybe you&apos;ll be nostalgic for a simpler time sans apps. (Sigh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163056/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/07/phone_booths_nearly_extinct_in_ny.php">remember phone booths</a>?)</p>
