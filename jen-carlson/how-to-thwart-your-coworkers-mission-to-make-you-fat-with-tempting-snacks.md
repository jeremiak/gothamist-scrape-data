<p>It all started with innocent &quot;Pizza Fridays,&quot; a weekly tradition at Gothamist HQ that involves ordering several pies from Grimaldi&apos;s at the end of a long work week. But those who partake <em>do so by choice</em>, and required to hand over money to get the goods&#x2014;in recent months, however, our office has been saturated with free, unhealthy snacks. Under International Blogger Law, when something is free you are obligated to consume it&#x2014;and with that, Gothamist HQ has been transformed into a dangerous den of gluttony, with one table dubbed &quot;the Silver Table Of Sin.&quot; It&apos;s gotten so out of control we even had to get a bigger refrigerator, and yesterday our standing desk station was dismantled and transformed into a snack station. There is absolutely nothing exaggerated or fictitious here, and our tale is not uncommon&#x2014;employees at companies everywhere deal with similar snacking issues&#x2014;<em>but what can be done?</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="silvertableemails.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125726im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/silvertableemails.jpg" width="640" height="287" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>First, as a test sample of the typical office, here&apos;s a look at what we&apos;re dealing with&#x2014;at press time, we&apos;re being tempted by two tubs of Sour Power Straws; a plastic pumpkin filled with Reese&apos;s products, Sweet Tarts, and Blow Pops; various gourmet chocolate bars sent from our neighbors at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125726/http://www.howaboutwe.com/">How About We [Fatten Up Gothamist]</a>; and boxes upon boxes of Girls Scout Cookies. There is a real fear as to what will occur if this supply of sugar and fat ends abruptly, even though the main suppliers assure us there&apos;s only MORE on the way.</p>

<p>When asked about the infernal plastic pumpkin with the never-ending supply of candy inside, Gothamist co-founder Jen Chung noted that soon it would be replenished with fresh product&#x2014;&quot;CVS has Easter candy... so expect that!&quot; When pressed further about the health factors, Chung threw us some shade and recalled, &quot;I also brought fruit salad when I brought the 24 bagels in last week.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="homerquotepull.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125726im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/homerquotepull.jpg" width="301" height="197" class="image-right"> </span>When asked about his contribution, Tien Mao&#x2014;who is responsible for the enormous stash of Girl Scout Cookies that appeared yesterday&#x2014;simply alluded to a near-endless supply: &quot;Hopefully I purchased enough to last until the summer.&quot; Mao pivoted and quickly walked away as we tried to explain that we were not interested in <em>more</em>, but were working on a piece about unhealthy office snacks...</p>

<p>Laws that limit employers&apos; power to &quot;curate&quot; snack consumption have stymied Gothamist publisher Jake Dobkin, who tells us the relentless river of sugary snacks is &quot;obviously a passive-aggressive attempt to work out hostility by making your co-workers fat.  It&apos;s immoral and should be illegal, and in Sweden it probably is.&quot; But there <em>are</em> those who enjoy the sugar fixes, like the young Chris Robbins, whose metabolism is still going full speed&#x2014;this afternoon he told us, &quot;Office snacks are crucial for morale. If you want productive, Pavlovian responses to work stimuli, peanut butter is more effective than pageviews. Some people thought that negotiating a salary in Reese&apos;s cups was insane, but those same people still find it hard to stay the hell away from my Reese&apos;s cups. Seriously, stay the hell away.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems office snacks are here to stay, so we&apos;ve reached out to an expert for tips on running the gauntlet of junk food and dodging endless dips of the hand into the candy bucket. Holistic Nutritionist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125726/http://kimrossnutrition.com/">Kim Ross</a> passed along these tips:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Avoid all &quot;free&quot; candy on colleagues&apos; desks<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Bring 3 different fruits and a small bag of mixed nuts with you and leave on your desk so you can see them and snack as desired when temptation occurs<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Always have water or herbal tea at your disposal (hot and cold drinks to fill all needs)<br>
<strong>4.</strong> If you do indulge in office junk, limit quantity to 1 or 2 pieces of it and eat sitting down at your desk; follow with green tea which is a fat-burning aid.</p>

<p>During a brief experiment, known as the office&apos;s Fruit Cup Renaissance, one office Hero brought in and prepared fresh fruit cups everyday for one week, for any coworker interested. Through the course of that week, everyone&apos;s eyes were a little bit more open, and skin a little less sallow. And we&apos;re totally going to do that again, once we kick these boxes of Girl Scout Cookies.</p>
