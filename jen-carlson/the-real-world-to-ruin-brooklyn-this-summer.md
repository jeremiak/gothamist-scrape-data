<p>Entering its 21st season, MTV&apos;s <em>The Real World</em> returns to New York for a third time...but for the first time it&apos;s headed to an outer-borough. That&apos;s right, the seven generic, good-looking roommates will be heading to Brooklyn. </p>

<p>Shooting begins this summer, and will result in 12 hour-long episodes. In the press release we received, Jon Murray, co-creator of the show, says &quot;The Brooklyn season, like the Hollywood season, will focus on what people loved about &apos;The Real World&apos; when it launched in 1992 - genuine people, meaningful conflict and powerful stories.&quot; Really Jon? We&apos;re sort of betting it&apos;ll be more about the cast taking over bars, fighting with locals, getting drunk and sleeping with roommates -- all as they take their amazingly overpriced living quarters for granted.</p>

<p>The big question now is: Which part of Brooklyn will have the distinct pleasure of welcoming the new residents? Our guess is they&apos;ll be taking over a few luxury condo units in Williamsburg. Perhaps this will unite the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520213208/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/26/things_hipsters.php">hipsters</a> and anti-hipsters of the &apos;nabe? Either way, get ready to see the production taking over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520213208/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/05/a_pool_party_mi.php">McCarren Pool Parties</a> this summer. </p>
