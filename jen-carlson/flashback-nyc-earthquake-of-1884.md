That&apos;s right, we&apos;re not immune to natural disasters. On August 10th of that year, an earthquake estimated to be at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184042/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1884_08_10.php">magnitude of 5.5</a> hit &#x2014; it was believed to be centered off Far Rockaway or Coney Island.<p></p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184042/http://www.gendisasters.com/data1/ny/earthquakes/eastcoast-earthquake-aug1884.htm">an article</a> from that time, there are reports from all over the city describing the scene. &quot;Its duration was about ten seconds.  The telegraph manager at Coney Island promptly asked for particulars of the &apos;explosion,&apos; supposing that some oil refinery, powder mill or dynamite factory had blown up.  A few minutes later, however, the fact became known there that the whole island had been thoroughly shaken by the vibrations.&quot; Locals were advised to stand outside of their houses, and police on the Brooklyn Bridge reported &quot;the shock was distinctly felt there, and the great towers at either end oscillated visibly, while the bridge itself rocked as if struck by a hurricane.&quot;</p>

<p>The site also reminds us of a 2008 Columbia University study noting that the city has several fault lines (including one along 125th Street), and we&apos;re due for a quake in the 5.0 or higher range. In fact, seismologists say we should expect one every 100 years... and we&apos;re 30 years overdue (though there was a small one in 2001).</p>
