<p>It&apos;s been a couple of weeks since <em>Mad Men</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145556/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/11/mad_men_15.php">ended its fifth season</a>, and since then the cast has been talking about what they were unable to while the show was filming and airing. The latest comes from Elisabeth Moss, who plays Peggy on the show&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145556/http://www.gq.com/entertainment/tv/blogs/the-stream/2012/06/elisabeth-moss-talks-about-the-mad-men-finale-and-looks-forward-to-season-6.html">she talked to GQ</a> recently about finding out her character would be leaving Don Draper &amp; Co., and also if she&apos;ll return for future seasons. Moss said:</p><blockquote>&quot;God, it&apos;s so funny, &apos;cause of course, I kind of know what&apos;s going to happen... I didn&apos;t realize that so many people would think that [Peggy was leaving]. So now I&apos;m in this position of having to be really secretive about this, which I didn&apos;t anticipate having to do! So now I have to be very secretive for the next however-long months... I almost feel like I just want to talk to Matt [Weiner] and say, can you give me something to say, and I&apos;ll just say this one line... I think Matt said something online like, &apos;Peggy will always be a part of Don&apos;s life&apos;?&quot;</blockquote>Of course, not everyone is being as strictly secretive&#x2014;in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145556/http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/06/05/060512-arts-jared-harris-ruiz/">a recent interview</a>, Jared Harris let this slip out: &quot;Elisabeth left the episode before and she&#x2019;d been there since the beginning. People leave and it&#x2019;s just part of it. They didn&#x2019;t make a giant fuss.&quot; His comment made some waves, and got people thinking Peggy was gone for good, which Moss also addressed:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;Well, you can draw your own conclusions from my movements in the world at some point. If I&apos;m in L.A. shooting <em>Mad Men</em>, then I guess they&apos;re not letting me go! But at the same time, honestly, I don&apos;t know exactly what&apos;s going to happen. I don&apos;t know how things are going to unfold or what the storylines are going to be. But honestly, the really cool thing that happened since Jared said that thing in the article, is that people have been really upset about Peggy leaving. Again, maybe it&apos;s me being na&#xEF;ve, but I didn&apos;t anticipate that. It&apos;s incredibly flattering! Like the worst thing that could happen is that nobody would care, you know?&quot;</blockquote>Of course, people caring about Peggy isn&apos;t <em>always</em> flattering&#x2014;at this year&apos;s Great GoogaMooga in Brooklyn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145556/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-05-21/news/31804306_1_khloe-and-lamar-khloe-kardashian-photos">Moss reportedly snapped</a> when a fan told her she looked like Peggy, saying, &#x201C;I know! That&#x2019;s only like the 1,000th fucking time anyone&#x2019;s said that to me!&#x201D; Let&apos;s all chillax with this weird video:
