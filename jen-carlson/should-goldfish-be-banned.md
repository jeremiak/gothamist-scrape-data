<p>The San Francisco Animal Control &amp; Welfare Commission is suggesting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318040734/http://sfist.com/2011/06/15/san_francisco_to_ban_goldfish.php">a citywide ban on goldfish sales</a>, with a rep explaining, &quot;Most fish in aquariums are either mass bred under inhumane conditions or taken from the wild. That leads to devastation of tropical fish from places like Southeast Asia.&quot; Plus, that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318040734/http://www.flickr.com/photos/damski/4801946792/">ping pong ball goldfish game</a> at fairs always did seem a little bit cruel.</p>

<p>The proposal is all part of the commission&apos;s push for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318040734/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/06/14/BA661JTO52.DTL#ixzz1PSy6GeZy">a pet sale ban in the city</a>, which previously didn&apos;t include goldfish, but did include hamsters and other small pets. The goal is to prevent &quot;impulse buys,&quot; and to make it harder for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318040734/http://gothamist.com/tags/puppymills">puppy and kitten mills</a> to supply pet stores.</p>

<p>We contacted the Humane Society of the U.S. to find out if this is something that may go nationwide, but they were unaware of a proposed goldfish plan; we&apos;ll update if they have any further comment after looking into it.</p>
