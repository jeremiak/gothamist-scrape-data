And the only way they&apos;ll leave is if the Department of Transportation physically removes them (which they have threatened to do once they find the signal&#x2014;location undisclosed!). Urban bird specialist Karen Purcell told the paper, &quot;They are fierce nest competitors. They are able to evict other birds, even native species. They are survivors.&quot; Can someone please write a children&apos;s book about this little feathered family?</p>
