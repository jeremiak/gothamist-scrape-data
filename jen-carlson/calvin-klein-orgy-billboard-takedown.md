</div></div>					<p>Looks like Calvin Klein succumbed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155456/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/is_the_calvin_klein_billboard_offen.php">the prudes in SoHo</a> who <em>just couldn&apos;t handle</em> an all-American denim-clad orgy billboard. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155456/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/06/23/2009-06-23_calvin_klein_tones_it_down_sort_of_in_soho.html">The Daily News</a> reports that the ad has now been replaced with one featuring a female, alone, in her soaking wet string bikini. Even though a lot more skin is being shown (and there are no jeans in sight!), some locals like the change. One old maid said, &quot;The old one bothered people. It was a little too explicit with the threesome. You didn&apos;t even notice the jeans as much as what was going on with the people.&quot; Yes, in this new one onlookers will clearly only notice the product, and not that lady wearing it.</p>

<p>The billboard space has housed many other salacious scenarios in the past (pictured!), though allegedly they were all more acceptable to the masses. Is New York City the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155456/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose">Elmore City</a>, Oklahoma? Italy, France, Spain and Germany are all okay with the foursome <em>and</em> they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155456/http://www.frillr.com/?q=node/12530">airing this commercial</a>, uncensored. And you don&apos;t even want to know about the print ads they have for Burger King in Saigon. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155456/http://copyranter.blogspot.com/2009/06/new-king-of-blow-job-ads.html">Or do you</a>?)</p>
