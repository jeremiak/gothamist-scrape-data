title: We've Got Prime Conditions For The Peak Of The Perseid Meteor Shower
---

	
										<p>Every time an Event In The Sky happens over North America&#x2014;meteor showers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloodmoon">blood moons</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/aurora_borealis.php">aurora borealis</a>, a star, just any star, remember stars?&#x2014;we picture the below occurring as a backdrop behind our skyline. How cool would that be? Surely <em>this</em> meteor shower/blood moon/aurora borealis will be different, and what we read online about being able to see it in the city will actually be TRUE.</p>

<p>But what happens is that we get this. Because we live in a city with light pollution, and also it&apos;s usually cloudy that day, and why don&apos;t you just move to the country if you want to see the sky so badly?</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="nycsky15.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/nycsky15.jpg" width="640" height="400" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">What we can see here, but picture more light pollution</span></p>

<p>Keep all of those letdowns from the past in mind as we tell you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/check_out_the_perseid_meteor_shower.php">the annual Perseid meteor shower</a> is about to peak, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417/http://www.nymetroweather.com/2015/08/12/perseid-meteor-shower-peaks-tonight-heres-how-to-see-it/">NYMetroWeather</a>, &quot;astronomers are suggesting the potential for up to 100 meteors per hour&quot; during the early morning hours (that&apos;s tonight, Wednesday, into tomorrow morning, Thursday).</p>

<p>This year even the moon is cooperating, dimming down to a thin crescent to make the meteors more visible. Also, check out these clear skies predicted!: </p>

<span class="photo_caption">Clear skies, thin moons, full meteor shower</span></p>

<p>But what about New York City specifically? NYMetroWeather points out that, <em>of course</em>, &quot;the city light interferes greatly with viewing anything in the night sky,&quot; suggesting instead that you &quot;head out to the suburbs of New Jersey, New York, Long Island, or Connecticut. Light pollution in those areas is far less than within the 5 boroughs. This will give you a much better chance to see the meteors.&quot; </p>

<p>According to this map, we are in a red zone of light pollution, but not that far away from being slightly in the clear&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-watch-this-weeks-perseid-meteor-shower-2015-8">Business Insider</a> points out: &quot;If you made it to an orange zone or better, you&apos;d be able to observe. Another way to gauge the light&#x2014;if you can see some stars, then you can see some meteors. If you look up and see nothing, then you need to keep moving away from the city.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lightpollmap.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lightpollmap.jpg" width="640" height="362" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>And it may just be worth a trekking out of the city for this. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417/http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide">EarthySky</a> says the annual event &quot;is perhaps the most beloved meteor shower of the year for the Northern Hemisphere,&quot; also making note of that &quot;slender waning crescent moon&quot; creating an ideal atmosphere for tonight&apos;s. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101417/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/summer-of-science-2015/latest/during-perseids-meteor-shower-catch-a-falling-star-but-stay-far-away-from-its-comet-mama">The NY Times</a> has even hyped it up, explaining that it&apos;s &quot;as if stars are darting at you from all directions.&quot;</p>
