title: Video: Johnny Rotten Goes Up Against Former Drummer On Judge Judy In 1997
---

	
										<p>In 1997 John Lydon (better known as Johnny Rotten) locked horns with his former drummer Robert Williams on Judge Judy. What a world! The former Sex Pistol was going up against his Public Image Limited drummer, who brought suit against Lydon for being fired without cause (breach of contract), and assault and battery.</p>

<p>During the back and forth, Lydon gets into life on the road with his hired gun drummer, saying, &quot;This whole hotel stuff he&apos;s coming up with. You must understand, these are small nightclub gigs, and we&apos;re traveling vast journeys on a tour bus, we&apos;re not staying overnight in most towns. There&apos;s no point in me wasting money on separate individual hotel rooms when I&apos;m perfectly able to share. And I&apos;m apparently the pop star!&quot; </p>

<p>Williams sort of Eddie Haskells it, and Judge Judy seems to favor the more <em>real</em> Lydon... but was it enough? Watch below!</p>
