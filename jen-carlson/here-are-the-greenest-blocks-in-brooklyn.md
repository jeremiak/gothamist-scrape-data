---

	
										<p>Yesterday the Brooklyn Botanic Garden held their annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409191057/http://gothamist.com/tags/greenestblock">Greenest Block</a> awards ceremony, and the big winners this year were in Bed-Stuy and Fort Greene. </p>

<p>The greenest residential block was deemed to be Bainbridge Street between Malcolm X Boulevard and Stuyvesant Avenue&#x2014;this block has entered the contest every year since 2004, and this is the first year it has won top place in the residential category.</p>

<p>&quot;This contest is not only about creating beauty with plants... At its heart, this contest is about the idea that neighborhood greening can strengthen communities and create committed environmental stewards,&#x201D; said Scot Medbury, BBG president. &#x201C;We continue to see a rise in the use of native plants, sustainable gardening techniques, and green infrastructure, which go beyond beautification in benefiting neighborhoods.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The greenest commercial block was determined to be Fulton Street between South Portland Avenue and South Oxford Street&#x2014;this block just underwent a $100,000 project that involved planting new trees, removing stumps, and adding tree guards to protect the new trees.</p>
