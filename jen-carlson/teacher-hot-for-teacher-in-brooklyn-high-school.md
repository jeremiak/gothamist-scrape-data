And the lustful language teachers are getting extra attention for their dirty deed because they&apos;re both women... one of them a <em>married woman</em>. Quelle surprise! </p>

<p>Alini Brito, 29, and Cindy Mauro, 33, were spotted in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711012411/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/12/09/2009-12-09_teachers_pet__each_other_naked_lust_was_part_of_their_lesson_plan_at_high_school.html">au natural embrace by a janitor</a> (while students were in the auditorium), and yada yada yada, they&apos;re now being investigated for misconduct. While under investigation the tenured teachers have been sent to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711012411/http://gothamist.com/tags/rubberroom">rubber rooms</a> by the Department of Education.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, their students are left with plenty of gossip fodder. They&apos;ve already started a Facebook page to discuss the incident, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711012411/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/12/09/2009-12-09_teachers_pet__each_other_naked_lust_was_part_of_their_lesson_plan_at_high_school.html">the Daily News</a>. One 18-year-old junior says, &quot;[Ms. Mauro] was pretty fun. <strong>She dressed like a teenage girl &#x2014; she&apos;d wear low-cut tops, shorts, three-quarter length jeans. She was kinda sexy. </strong>You could see that she was the kind of person who would flirt.&quot;</p>
