<p>Last night was disappointing for many Americans, who watched in horror as Donald Trump was declared to be the next President of the United States. Tonight some of those Americans have taken to the streets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022639/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/trump-election-protest-berkeley-oakland.html?_r=0">across the country</a>. In New York City, there were two protest marches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022639/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/trump_protest_nyc.php">announced earlier</a> today&#x2014;one starting in Union Square, the other in Columbus Circle, eventually coming together and heading to Trump Tower. There are thousands of protesters&#x2014;with reports of anywhere from 5,000 to 7,500 taking part. </p>

<p>Chants have included &quot;Not My President,&quot; &quot;Fuck Giuliani,&quot; &quot;Impeach Trump&quot; and even &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022639/https://twitter.com/ChristRobbins/status/796513897628975108">Fuck Jimmy Fallon</a>&quot; (outside of <em>The Tonight Show</em> studio, where the host not so long ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022639/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/16/fallon_trump_heads_on_sticks.php">invited Trump</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022639/https://twitter.com/DaveCoIon">Dave Colon</a> is on the scene and tells us drivers being stopped by the march have been giving high fives to the group, and &quot;a bunch of cars honked in support, people were in pretty good spirits considering.&quot;</p>

<p>Below is a livestream of the protest, which is now outside of Trump Tower&#x2014;people are boo&apos;ing and shouting &quot;Fuck Trump!&quot; Fifth Avenue is now closed. More updates to come.</p>

<p>Earlier today the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022639/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/nypd_trump_tower_security.php">set up barricades</a> around Trump Tower.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Police have arrested dozens of protesters. A flag was burned outside of Trump Tower, an act that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022639/https://twitter.com/patrickdehahn/status/796523422985682944">not everyone supported</a>, but one that has been seen at other protests in the nation tonight. </p>
