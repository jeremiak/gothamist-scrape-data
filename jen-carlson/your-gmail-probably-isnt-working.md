title: Your Gmail Probably Isn't Working

<p>Remember when electronic mail didn&apos;t exist and had to rely on telephones and in-person conversations? Embrace that era of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045135/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/video_louis_ck_beautifully_explains.php">being less connected</a> now, because your Gmail is probably not really working.</p>

<p>The Google team is ON IT, however, and has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045135/http://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=issue&amp;ts=1379995199000&amp;sid=1&amp;iid=043f082bc7cd18e15458318035d9bc7a">updating the problem here</a>&#x2014;around 2 p.m. things sort of took a turn for the worst, and they informed the masses that they are continuing to investigate the issue, which has become more widespread since this morning when it began. At 2:05 p.m. it was affecting around 50% of Gmail users, who are receiving emails hours after they were sent, or not at all.</p>

<p>On the upside, that guy you were enjoying a casual back-and-forth email flirtation with probably wasn&apos;t weirded out by your last reply? His email is probably just in the electronic purgatory the rest of our emails are in.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> They now &quot;expect a resolution for all users within the next 1 hour [so, around 4 p.m.]. Please note this time frame is an estimate and may change.&quot;</p>
