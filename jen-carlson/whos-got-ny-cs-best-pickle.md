<p>This Sunday is National Pickle Day (not to be confused with International Pickle Day, celebrated in October), and as New Yorkers, we&apos;re kind of obligated to recognize its importance. Why? Well did ya know that by 1659, &quot;Dutch farmers in New York grew cucumbers all over the area that&apos;s now known as Brooklyn&quot; and those cucumbers became pickles that were sold in barrels on Washington, Canal and Fulton Streets? This is according to the New York Food Museum, which has an entire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093104/http://www.nyfoodmuseum.org/_ptime.htm">pickle timeline</a>. So basically, brine is in our blood.</p>

<p>Anyway, the place to be Sunday is probably Rare (located at 152 West 26th Street), because they&apos;re hosting an All You Can Eat Fried Pickle Contest (winner takes home a $250 gift certificate). Regrettably, we cannot attend nor can we participate, but we <em>are</em> hosting our own, online, unofficial New York City&apos;s Best Pickle Contest... right now. Vote below, and then go treat yourself to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093104/http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/case-study-got-your-pickleback/">a pickleback</a>, you deserve it.</p>
