<p>The New Museum seems to be a magnet for strange activity. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823134904/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/13/new_museum_roadkill.php">Earlier this year</a> a dead deer was spotted outside of its doors, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823134904/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/04/guerilla-banner-artist-displays-latest-work-on-new-museum/">AnimalNY</a> reports that &quot;during the press preview for the New Museum&#x2019;s triennial exhibition, &apos;Younger Than Jesus,&apos; someone hung a giant banner stating &apos;Please, New Museum, Show My Work&apos; on the facade outside.&quot; It was promptly removed, but a painting across the street with the same plea was also spotted. Until the artist reveals him/herself however, the stunt has failed since no one knows who the work belongs to. However, <em>someone</em> with video capabilities happened to be nearby when the banner was still up, and they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823134904/http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=65301838231">made a video</a> including both that and the painting&#x2014;ultimately asking the artist to unmask thyself. We&apos;ve asked the New Museum to comment on the artwork, but have yet to hear back.</p>
