<p>Back on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083728/http://history.amusement-parks.com/dreamlandfire.htm">May 27, 1911</a> Coney Island was doing worse off than it is today, with Dreamland Park in flames for a full 18 hours, burning to the ground and never again being rebuilt as it was. But a piece of the glory days was just found underwater; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083728/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09022009/news/regionalnews/ringing_in_the_old_at_coney_187745.htm">the NY Post</a> reports that local divers are bringing up a piece of the past: a massive 500-lb bell that sunk to the ocean floor with the rest of the pier. Diver Gene Ritter told the paper, &quot;I knew the bell existed, but I never dreamed I would find it. I thought it would be buried in mud. I was stunned, especially over the incredible shape the bell is in.&quot; </p>

<p>Ritter found it back in November, but it was 18 years before that when he first came upon the remnants of Dreamland in the ocean. Back in 1999 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083728/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/nyregion/the-urban-deep.html?pagewanted=all">the NY Times</a> reported that he had found &quot;turn-of-the-century Coke and beer bottles, cutlery and Victorian light fixtures&quot; so far. As for the bell, it&apos;s 3-feet-high and inscribed with &quot;James Gregory, NY, 1885,&quot; a trapeze artist and founding member of the Gregory Brothers Circus.</p>

<p>No reports yet on where (or if) the bell will ring once it&apos;s fully restored. More photos from the fire can be seen courtesy of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083728/http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/may271911/">Library of Congress</a>.</p>
