<p>An ASPCA rep has gotten back to us regarding the beloved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091458/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/20/onlookers_claim_beloved_baseball_do.php">Coffee the dog</a>, who many claim is being forced to wear a shock collar while sitting in the parking lot of Mets and Yankees game earning cash for her human. The most recent photo we received of her showed she had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091458/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/22/coffee_3.php">no teeth</a> (and recently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091458/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=229198940428050&amp;set=pu.225340330813911&amp;type=1#!/photo.php?fbid=229234270424517&amp;set=pu.225340330813911&amp;type=1&amp;pid=1171721&amp;id=225340330813911">Stop Abusing Coffee</a> Facebook page posted a photo of her owner, from a video). Here&apos;s what the organization told us:</p>

<blockquote>The ASPCA sent a team of agents from its Humane Law Enforcement department to Yankee Stadium on Sunday&#x2014;after receiving calls from the public over the weekend alerting us to this matter&#x2014;in the event that Coffee and his owner would be on hand for the Subway Series.  Both, however, were not present.  

<p>The ASPCA understands and appreciates that the public is concerned over the treatment of Coffee.  And while there is no specific evidence indicating that any New York State animal cruelty laws have been violated, we will continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to take appropriate action, as warranted.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>When asked if they&apos;d be returning to the ballparks, they declined to go into specifics, but did say, &quot;we will absolutely continue to monitor this situation and be prepared to take action, in the event that any NYS animal cruelty laws are being violated.&quot; In other words, perhaps it&apos;s time to turn the press spotlight off this pup so they can do their job... but if you spot Coffee, report her whereabouts to the ASPCA&#x2019;s Humane Law Enforcement department:  212-876-7700 ext. 4450 or enforcement@aspca.org.</p>
