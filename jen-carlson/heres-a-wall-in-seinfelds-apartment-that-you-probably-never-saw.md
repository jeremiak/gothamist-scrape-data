title: Here's A Wall In Seinfeld's Apartment That You Probably Never Saw
---

	
										<p>Starting June 24th, Hulu will make every episode of <em>Seinfeld</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223319/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/29/seinfeld_will_stream_on_hulu_in_180.php">available to stream</a>, all 180 of them. You know what you won&apos;t see in those episodes though? This wall. They yadda yadda&apos;d right over it! </p>

<p>Today, one day after the show&apos;s 25th anniversary (it premiered on May 31st, 1990), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223319/http://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8689001/seinfeld-fourth-wall">Vox has declared</a> that this &quot;never-before-seen photo&quot; shows &quot;the fourth wall.&quot; The photo, which has been up on Getty for quite some time, has probably been seen by at least a few (hundred thousand) people. But sure, let&apos;s play this game. So, <em>what has the wall been hiding?</em></p>

<blockquote>You&apos;ll see a vintage Porsche ad, a baseball poster, a photo of an old horse and carriage, and another baseball picture. It&apos;s classic Jerry &#x2014; it turns out that even on the fourth wall, his passion for baseball and cars is fierce.</blockquote>

<p>The cameras never really panned back to show the wall, since that&apos;s where they were operating from. This clip shows pretty much all of the point of views we got on our screen: </p>

<p>And here&apos;s an interview with the show&apos;s set designer, Thomas E. Azzari, who was responsible for the look of the show.</p>
