<p>Mark Twain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204545/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/20/how_mark_twain_partied_in_nyc.php">knew how to party</a>, and possibly did it too well, having once declared: &quot;Sometimes too much to drink is barely enough.&quot; But anyone who says that surely has something good in his glass, and in 1874 that something good was a whiskey drink. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204545/http://www.thesavory.com/drink/mark-twain-cocktail-recipe.html">this Savory post</a>, he penned a letter to his wife Olivia in 1874, while he was in London, telling her about his new favorite drink:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Livy my darling, I want you to be sure and remember to have, in the bathroom when I arrive, a bottle of Scotch Whiskey, a lemon, some crushed sugar, and a bottle of Angostura bitters. Ever since I have been in London I have taken in a wine glass what is called a cock-tail (made with those ingredients) before breakfast, before dinner, and just before going to bed.&#x201D;</blockquote>Here&apos;s that recipe for you... serve it in a wine glass for authenticity.<p></p>

<p><strong>Mark Twain Cocktail</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>1.5 oz Scotch Whiskey<br>
</li><li>.75 oz Fresh Lemon Juice<br>
</li><li>1 oz Simple Syrup<br>
</li><li>2 Dashes Angostura Bitters<br>
</li><li>Lemon Twist for Garnish<br>
</li><li><em>Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled glass. Garnish with a Lemon Twist.</em></li></ul>And wash it all down with some wisdom from Twain himself, who had plenty to say about the New Year:<ul><li>&quot;New Year&apos;s Day: Now is the accepted time to make your regular annual good resolutions. Next week you can begin paving hell with them as usual.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Yesterday, everybody smoked his last cigar, took his last drink and swore his last oath. Today, we are a pious and exemplary community. Thirty days from now, we shall have cast our reformation to the winds and gone to cutting our ancient shortcomings considerably shorter than ever.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;A new oath holds pretty well; but... when it is become old, and frayed out, and damaged by a dozen annual retryings of its remains, it ceases to be serviceable; any little strain will snap it.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;New Year&apos;s is a harmless annual institution, of no particular use to anybody save as a scapegoat for promiscuous drunks, and friendly calls and humbug resolutions.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
