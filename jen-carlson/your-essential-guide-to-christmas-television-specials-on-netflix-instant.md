Maybe when you are stressed you go running, and that is great for you and a really healthy decision, but I watch those Lifetime/ABC Family/Hallmark movies, as well as their off-brand counterparts which may have never even aired on television. In order to make this feel like a more productive \"pastime,\" I will now share with you my vast knowledge of these films and guide you towards the best ones so that you may join me in a yuletide shame spiral... for \<em\>the best ones\<\/em\> are the Christmas ones.\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nThe small screen holiday movie always, and without exception, includes the following characters: a young woman unlucky in love (if she is not a workaholic, she is a single mom and/or struggling with her career); a young man (literally any generically attractive one will do, sometimes they don\'t even get their own backstory); a best friend (usually it seems like the main character doesn\'t even like her); and a wise old man who will teach us all a lesson. The setting is either The Big City or Main Street, U.S.A. And even with this steadfast formula, they are somehow still all unique, like snowflakes.\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nClick through for some of the best and worst of these cinematic stocking stuffers, which are all available on Netflix Instant. Honorable mentions go to \<a href=\"http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Desperately_Seeking_Santa/70199165?trkid=2361637\"\>\<em\>Desperately Seeking Santa\<\/em\>\<\/a\> (which centers around a woman who seeks out a sexy Santa in order to save the mall she works for in Boston. I\'d give it a solid B!); and  \<a href=\"http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Crazy_for_Christmas/70245263?trkid=2361637\"\>\<em\>Crazy For Christmas\<\/em\>\<\/a\> (which is really just kind of C-level heartwarming flick). There are, of course, also new ones I haven\'t even seen yet because I don\'t have television, but if you do, please let me know \<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150277561529980&set=a.291533034979.40184.10542514979&type=1\"\>how this one\<\/a\> starring Winnie Cooper from \<em\>The Wonder Years\<\/em\> is?

The movie revolves around workaholic publicist Sloane Spencer, which means you\'re getting the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future because that is the loose plotline they go with when a workaholic is involved.

In fact, they are probably not good at all. These movies are akin to soap operas, which is a whole different type of acting, so seeing an A or even B-lister star in one is just unnatural, depressing, and distracting.

Amy Acker, who was Fred on \<em\>Angel\<\/em\>, and David Haydn-Jones (who was in an episode of \<em\>Buffy\<\/em\>). This one takes place in New York, and follows the 24-year-old Crystal on a journey to figure out her life, which begins when she finds a letter to Santa written by Derek\'s daughter.
