<p>We all know how nightmarish it can be to sentence yourself to brunch: you wait and wait and wait, only to be seated next to a crying baby, <em>or worse</em>, a gang of 21-year-olds who just discovered bottomless mimosas. Well, it&apos;s going to be so much more unbearable on New Year&apos;s Day, so we recommend hosting your own brunch&#x2014;you can even do it without getting your hands too dirty <em>or</em> shelling out too much cash. Here are some catered brunch options, from the inexpensive, to the pricier (but remember, you will be saving a lot of money on alcohol).</p>
