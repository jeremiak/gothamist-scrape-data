But discussions fell apart over issues like whether to create a center aisle (the opera was strongly in favor; the ballet, adamantly opposed) and how to adjust the acoustics (the opera believes they are in dire need of redress; the ballet thinks they&#x2019;re fine).</blockquote>One thing that&apos;s helped the two step forward is the new chairmen of the boards, Barry S. Friedberg at the ballet and Susan L. Baker at the opera. &quot;When Mr. Mortier was selected, he made a strong case for staying at the State Theater, a marked shift from the stance of his predecessor, Paul Kellogg, who had spearheaded the search for a new home.&quot; With both companies staying, the New York State Theater will see some changes, including a modular acoustical system that can be moved in for the opera and out for the ballet...a larger orchestra pit that can move up and down; to upgrade the seating, carpeting and box office; and to rewire the theater to improve lighting and media capabilities.&quot; That center aisle isn&apos;t happening in this lifetime, however.<p></p>

<p>The two companies have been alternating seasons at the State Theater, and are scheduled to present a progress report on Thursday. The changes (which will cost from $30 to $60 million) are part of a major redevelopment of Lincoln Center which should be wrapping up in 2010. The opening night fundraiser event last week kicked off the Ballet&apos;s 59th season and raised around $1.6 million.</p>
