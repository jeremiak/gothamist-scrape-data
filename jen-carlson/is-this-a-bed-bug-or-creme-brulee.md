										<p>Perhaps you&apos;ve seen that new &quot;animal or food&quot; meme that&apos;s swept the World Wide Web. I keep seeing it&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121048/https://twitter.com/BRillustrations/status/709817806724964352">Dalmatian or ice cream</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121048/https://twitter.com/BRillustrations/status/709849656314957824">Pug or croissant</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121048/https://twitter.com/teenybiscuit/status/707004279324696577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Puppy or bagel</a>?&#x2014;mostly because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121048/https://twitter.com/NekoCase">Neko Case</a> retweets a lot of cool animal stuff and that recently included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121048/https://twitter.com/BRillustrations/status/709439752886427648">this fantastic collage of both sloth faces and pain au chocolat</a>. They look alike! Can you tell them apart? Of course you can, you always can, but for a split second, when your brain hasn&apos;t yet figured this puzzle out, you smile stupidly at it.</p>

<p>&quot;What NYC animals look like food?,&quot; I wondered recently, considering my first attempt at making a meme thing. And listen, I really tried to make &quot;pigeon&quot; work, but pigeons just look like rocks, and this meme works best with food. So I present you with: Bed bug or cr&#xE8;me br&#xFB;l&#xE9;e?</p>

<span class="photo_caption">Steal this meme. (Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>I have either ruined cr&#xE8;me br&#xFB;l&#xE9;e for you, or made bed bugs seems like a delicious dessert. So I&apos;m sorry and you&apos;re welcome. Please share this image until Neko Case RTs it. Thank you.</p>
