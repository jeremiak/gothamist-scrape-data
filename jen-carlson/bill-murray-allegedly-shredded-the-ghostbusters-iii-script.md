										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="murraybuster1211.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828144226im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/murraybuster1211.jpeg" width="300" height="281" class="image-right"> </span>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828144226/http://www.nationalenquirer.com/mike-walker/who-ya-gonna-call-not-bill-murray">National Enquirer</a> source (so take this with a grain of sensationalized salt), Bill Murray received the <em>Ghostbusters III</em> script, which we&apos;ve been hearing about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828144226/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters3">for years</a>, with Dan Aykroyd <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828144226/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/dan_aykroyd_says_there_will_be_a_gh.php">recently confirming</a> its existence. </p>

<p>The bad news is, the 61-year-old Murray allegedly shredded the papers, sending it back to Harold Ramis and Aykroyd with a note saying: <strong>&quot;No one wants to pay money to see fat, old men chasing ghosts!&quot;</strong> Actually, that sounds pretty awesome (and for the record we&apos;d also be psyched to watch a &quot;fat, old man&quot; chase around a pesky gopher). And it may still happen, as &quot;insiders&quot; say the team is moving forward with or without Murray.</p>

<p>After all, the thing is likely to bring in some cash, with the original grossing $291 million in 1984, and the 1989 sequel bringing in $215 million... but would you still see a third installment if it didn&apos;t include Dr. Peter Venkman?
