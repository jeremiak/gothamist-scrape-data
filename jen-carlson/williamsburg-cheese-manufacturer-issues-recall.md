										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="quesofresco0810.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140508070018im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/quesofresco0810.jpg" width="245" height="205" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s the summer of the recall! First <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140508070018/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/19/salmonella_detected_in_brooklyn_alf.php">eggs and alfalfa sprouts</a>, and now cheese. A Williamsburg cheese manufacturer&#x2014;who says, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;ve eaten Mexican food here, you&#x2019;ve eaten our cheese&quot;&#x2014;recalled two products after bacteria was found in them, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140508070018/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/35/wb_cheeserecall_2010_09_03_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>. The bacteria was discovered by the Rhode Island Health Department, who believed it could grow into &#x201C;Listeria monocytogene,&quot; which can be serious, or even fatal for the very young and old.</p>

<p>If you have any of the Azteca Linda Corporation&#x2019;s Queso Fresco white cheese and Queso Hebra string cheese, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140508070018/http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm223977.htm">with a September 11 expiration date</a>, you&apos;re gonna want to toss it. The company seems to be in the clear otherwise, however, with the paper noting that &quot;the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets hasn&#x2019;t found any traces of the really bad bacteria&#x2014;Listeria and Salmonella among them&#x2014;since the corporation opened in 1999.&quot;</p>
