<p>Let&apos;s face it, the G train has long been ignored by the MTA (a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164759/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/16/nyc_transits_top_typos.php">the typos</a> can even be found on that line), so it&apos;s not all that surprising that they&apos;ve proposed to cut back its service (no more G to Queens on evenings and weekends; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164759/http://www.mta.info/mta/09/section1v2.pdf">PDF of proposed changes</a>). This morning the line became one of many to be eulogized at a mock funeral service (previously straphangers paid their respects to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164759/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/z_train.php">the Z train</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164759/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/28/the_m_and_r_trains_to_get_eulogized.php">M and the R</a>). </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164759/http://savetheg.blogspot.com/">Save the G</a> Coalition, along with State Assembly Members Joseph Lentol and Hakeem Jeffries were amongst today&apos;s mourners who gathered at the Court Square subway station in Queens. Those who attended wore black armbands and listened to bagpiper (and mock funeral staple) John Maynard. Lentol had this to say about his friend: &quot;The G Train has been on life support for years and all of our efforts to revive it and bring it new life have gone completely ignored despite the tens of thousands of people who rely on it every day and the many more who would if the G were actually a reliable train.  So now we stand here at its funeral as we ask everyone to stand with us and take action one last time to save the G.&quot;</p>
