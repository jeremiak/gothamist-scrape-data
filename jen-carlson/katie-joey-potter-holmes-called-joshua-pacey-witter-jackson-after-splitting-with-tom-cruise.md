<p>If we were ever going to root for a fictional couple to get together in real life, it would definitely be Joey Potter and Pacey Witter&#x2014;or if you prefer: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160506034056/http://gothamist.com/tags/katieholmes">Katie Holmes</a> and Joshua Jackson. HE <strike>BOUGHT</strike> RENTED HER A WALL:</p>

<p>AHHHHHH, and then he wrote &quot;ASK ME TO STAY&quot; on the wall:</p>

<p>Anyway, you had to be there, but know that any <em>Dawson&apos;s Creek</em> fan worth their salt was rooting for Pacey and Joey when the show ended. So when Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes&apos;s relationship in real life ended, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160506034056/https://twitter.com/jenist/statuses/241166245959979009">a secret hope</a> that she&apos;d turn to her former co-star and on-screen boyfriend. After all, it wasn&apos;t too long after the show ended that Holmes was dragged into the world of Scientology, so it&apos;s only natural that she would come out of it looking back to what was a part of her former life.</p>

<p>Did we mention that Joey actually never asked Pacey to stay, but instead went with him, because relationships are all about compromise and sacrifice! </p>

<p>So today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160506034056/http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/joshua-jackson-katie-holmes-called-me-to-catch-up-after-tom-cruise-split-2012249">US Weekly</a> reported that Holmes <em>did</em> contact Jackson after her divorce from Cruise, something Jackson revealed last Thursday during an interview with Canadian talk show host George Stroumboulopoulos. According to Jackson (who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160506034056/http://www.eonline.com/news/318942/so-true-so-false-did-joshua-jackson-and-diane-kruger-really-get-engaged">not put a ring on it yet</a>), the conversation was &quot;very nice.&quot;</p><blockquote>&quot;Like any old friend, it was like, &apos;Oh, hi how are ya? What&apos;s going on?&apos;; &apos;I had a kid,&apos;&quot; he said of Suri Cruise, 6. The chat was &quot;nice,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;It was very nice, actually.&quot;</blockquote>Wait, read that again while holding for a dramatic pause before the last sentence, then immediately after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160506034056/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raGFI8pUau0">start playing this song</a>.<p></p>

<p>In the past, Holmes has said that Jackson was like her &quot;first love,&quot; but when a pitch for a <em>Dawson&apos;s Creek</em> movie/reunion came across her desk, &quot;Cruise said absolutely no way.&quot; At the very least, perhaps <em>that</em> can now get underway.</p>
