title: Pat Kiernan Headed To Live! With Kelly... For At Least One Episode

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lgkiernankelly.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015313im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/tien/lgkiernankelly.jpeg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In November, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015313/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/this_morning_is_regis_philbins_last.php">Regis Philbin left</a> his post at <em>Live! With Regis &amp; Kelly</em> (n&#xE9;e Kathie Lee), after co-hosting for over 20 years. Since then, the search has been on for a replacement, and of course, we&apos;ve been rooting for NY1 anchor Pat Kiernan. Last March <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015313/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/pat_kiernan_eyes_regiss_chair.php">he told us about being a dark horse contendor</a> for the show, and now nearly a full year later, he&apos;s been booked to guest host. </p>

<p>On March 7th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015313/http://gothamist.com/tags/patkiernan">Kiernan</a> will make his guest co-host debut alongside Kelly, and interviewing Willem Dafoe. Also guest hosting that week are Nick Lachey and Martin Short. Kiernan told us last night (tongue in cheek, of course): <strong>&quot;Only a handful of people in the world have my level of expertise in holding up newspapers on camera.  Kelly does an admirable job, but I know together we can take it to the next level.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Kiernan added, &quot;Of course I&apos;m nervous. As many hours as I&apos;ve spent on live TV, it&apos;s tough to step into a new situation. Kelly has proven an amazing ability over the past few weeks to make her co-hosts feel at ease. She&apos;s been taking the lead&#x2014;but she does it in a way that keeps the guest host involved.&quot; And we&apos;re sure Kiernan fans will be there with encouraging signs (&quot;KIERNAN MAKES MY HEART GO PAT PAT PAT,&quot; etc).</p>

<p>Until then, let&apos;s revisit Kiernan&apos;s recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507015313/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/video_pat_kiernan_stars_in_sht_pat.php">&quot;Sh*t Pat Kiernan Says&quot; video</a>, where he refers to a possible <em>Live!</em> stint.</p>
