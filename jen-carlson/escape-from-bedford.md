Shocking. Apparently this &quot;Bedford Avenue&quot; is getting pretty popular. </p>

<p>The article, called &quot;Escape From New York&quot;, is a list of complaints we&apos;ve all heard before about rent in a once slightly cheaper area now costing more, and hipsters with trusts funds sitting in coffee shops all day (though we&apos;d be willing to bet some of them may just work nights). The writer, Abigail Frankfurt, lived in Williamsburg (having moved there from Chelsea) until she got priced out (about the time &quot;the pseudo-hipsters&quot; rolled into town). She states in her diatribe that &quot;I am not moving to Queens, the Bronx or Staten Island,&quot; and that she wouldn&apos;t come back to New York until she could live in Manhattan again. We&apos;d personally rather deal with the &quot;pseudo hipsters&quot; than someone who thinks like that. </p>

<p>So she sold off almost all of the contents of her apartment (keeping her Salinger and Franzen books), which, by the way, was &quot;number 143 Metropolitan Avenue, at Berry Street&quot; and moved to the Midwest. Non-ironically, we think. </p>
