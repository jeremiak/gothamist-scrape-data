<p><em>How did we get here?</em> </p>

<p>For a brief moment in time on Thursday, a Brooklyn street was dedicated to New York City&apos;s own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022155519/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">#PizzaRat</a>. It was called Pizza Rat Blvd. Despite being a metaphor for life in New York City&#x2014;because everything New Yorkers see and think about is nothing more than a metaphor for ourselves&#x2014;it was not very &quot;viral.&quot;</p>

<p>Has this city lost its goddamn mind? Has #PizzaRat been given what the Beastie Boys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022155519/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/18/should_there_be_a_beastie_boys_squa.php">have been denied</a>? Is the idiocracy leaking offline and into real life? Fear not, while #PizzaRat will live on as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022155519/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/05/vermin_commodified.php">a Sexy Halloween Costume</a> and some future blog posts with diminishing returns, the madness ends there. Actually... it ends after #PizzaRat&apos;s appearance on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022155519/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/06/the_unbreakable_kimmy_schmidt.php"><em>The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</em></a>, which is what this sign was for.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022155519/http://abcnews.go.com/US/pizza-rat-blvd-street-sign-mysteriously-pops-brooklyn/story?id=34521588">to ABC</a>, the sign&#x2014;spotted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022155519/https://instagram.com/p/83axucQfZb/">Fred Benenson</a>&#x2014;was at the corner of India Street and Franklin Street in Greenpoint. An employee at 3 Roots Cafe told them it had been put up by crew members working on the Netflix series&#x2014;&quot;They had notified us about it in advance. It was only up for a few hours.&quot;</p>

<p>As if the internet would ever allow you to forget: last month #PizzaRat became a viral sensation, despite <em>failing</em> to do what every New Yorker can do in their sleep: eat a piece of pizza. The rat spotted a slice on steps leading down a subway platform, and got skittish when a human began filming it, abandoning the slice as regret filled its eyes.</p>

<p>We&apos;ll be back with more #PizzaRat content in the Spring of 2016, when this episode airs.</p>
