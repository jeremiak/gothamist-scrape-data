title: Should You Watch A Feature Film On Your Laptop On The Subway Without Headphones?
---

	
										<p>There are good New York City noises. The kind you miss when you are in a more bucolic location. Whatever that constant hum in the air is&#x2014;made up of rumbling subways, traffic, talking. It&apos;s a noise that, after a certain amount of time living here, you wish could be recreated in a white noise machine, so that you may bring it with you on vacation. Sometimes you just can&apos;t sleep without it. But there are bad New York City noises, too...</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070003/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/08/how_the_noise_gets_made.php">Upstairs neighbor noise</a> has been known to send even the most Zen humans straight to a padded room. The ice cream truck parked outside your window will make you lose your goddamn mind. And what about that guy on the subway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070003/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/subway_etiquette_please_wear_headph.php">listening to something without headphones</a>? Awful. This morning reporter Sarah Nir&apos;s commuting fate was sealed when the doors shut on a subway car that locked her in with a man <em>watching a movie on his laptop without headphones</em>. Is that Olivia Munn?</p>

<p>Nir, who tells us this &quot;was on the A train going from West 4th to 42nd St. at 12:30 p.m., asked Twitter: &quot;[Is it] acceptable to watch a movie without headphones on subway? I&apos;m on fence. It IS just talking after all.&quot; </p>

<p>That is not correct. It is not just talking. Audio is very different when it&apos;s coming from a device, and when it&apos;s coming from someone&apos;s mouth. And audio playing through a laptop or iPhone sans headphones is <em>especially</em> grating. </p>

<p>Talking is smooth, silky, tempered. Listening to a movie on your laptop without headphones <em>on the subway</em> sounds like a recording of someone screaming into a trash can, a recording that has had all of the bass cut from the mix, leaving just the treble. And then playing that recording through your kid sister&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070003/http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Hat-Toy-Company-Little/dp/B001GW9NEK">Little Tunes MP3 Player</a>.</p>

<p>Will you survive a subway trip like this? Yes. Will the incident get under your skin and make you a little bit more annoyed that day? Probably, but it will wash off within the hour. Should you ever play anything without headphones on a subway? Hell no.</p>
