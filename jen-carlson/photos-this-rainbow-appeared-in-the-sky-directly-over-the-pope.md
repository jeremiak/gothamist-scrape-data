<span class="photo_caption">Pope Rainbow! (Photo by Jen Chung/Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>Earlier today Pope Francis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204005949/http://gothamist.com/tags/popeinnyc">rolled through Manhattan</a> in his Popemobile, as the sky opened up and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204005949/http://www.amazon.com/Arch-Heaven-Science-Mystery-Rainbow/dp/0199561664">a bow to heaven</a> appeared. </p>

<p>Of course, a rainbow is not caused by Heaven, as much as it is not caused by leprechauns. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204005949/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow">A rainbow</a> is &quot;a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky.&quot; But it was still a nice, scientific moment to behold.</p>

<p>Currently there is total blackness is in the sky, which is probably also not a sign. </p>

<p>The above photo was taken by our own Jen Chung, who promises it was not Photoshopped. Her claim is backed up by all of these other people who also witnessed this beautiful optical illusion:</p>
