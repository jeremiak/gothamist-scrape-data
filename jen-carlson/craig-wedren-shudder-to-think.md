This comes after the band reunited last year, ten years after their breakup, and played a limited amount of dates nationwide&#x2014;this album contains tracks handpicked from that tour. Prior to all this, the band (on Dischord Records) pushed the boundaries of the hardcore punk scene, and their legendary Pony Express Record (appropriately released on Epic) is regarded amongst many as one of the most influential albums in recent years. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Last week one of those whom it influenced, Alex Tween of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213248/http://www.myspace.com/forms">The Forms</a>, took some time from working on their upcoming EP to talk to frontman Craig Wedren about the past, present and future... oh, and that private island they shared with Pearl Jam back when major labels were throwing money at bands.</em></p>

<p><strong>You&apos;ve been quite busy doing a lot of reunion shows with Shudder to Think over the past couple of years. How have they been going?</strong> Amazingly well. A total, total pleasure. Just to fuckin&apos; hammer down like that. I don&apos;t think any of us have had just cause to go that heavy for about a decade. Did you see one of the shows? We have a very, very, hearty good time.</p>

<p><strong>I saw two of them actually and enjoyed them very much.  Over the years, Shudder has been a band that has had a lot of ups and downs, lots of hard luck sometimes. I always felt the band was very underrated. Has the fact that these reunion shows have been so successful been a kind of vindication for you? </strong> It was just very satisfying. Part of it, it&apos;s not like there were so many more people coming out to the shows, but what felt good was we didn&apos;t think anybody was going to show up, and people showed up everywhere we played, but it was more just being able to appreciate it for the first time, because back in the day, we were perpetually discontent with our level or state or stature or popularity.  I think it really sort of poisoned the well a little bit. In addition to kind of classically having that attitude and it becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy where the stories you tell about yourself are the stories that everybody tells about you, and then it sort of becomes your story. That in addition to that, which I genuinely believe, we had it pretty good. We had it really well. We did okay, and we always thought of ourselves as bigger, or should be as big as Aerosmith or Van Halen.</p>
