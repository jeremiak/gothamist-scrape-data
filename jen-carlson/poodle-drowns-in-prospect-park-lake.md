On January 2nd, Viviane Arzoumanian&#x2019;s 5-year-old poodle drowned after running on to the ice, <em>off leash</em> (which is not allowed at the park unless it&apos;s during the designated off-leash hours, and never allowed at the lake). Following the tragedy, Arzoumanian&#x2014;admitting she was breaking park rules&#x2014;has some ideas for the park that she believes could result in more effective animal rescues.<p></p>

<p>She says the rescue team that arrived didn&apos;t have the proper equipment to go safely out onto the icy lake; while there were ladders, she says there were &quot;no ropes, no life preserves, no floatation devices. If there were some sort of inflatable raft, anybody could go out there safely.&quot; So now she&apos;s asking the Parks Department to put boxes around the lake that contain self-inflating rafts and more suitable rescue equipment. (Perhaps they should also include a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605212625/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/31/prospect_park_not_fining_unlawful_f.php">complaint box</a>!)</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the Prospect Park folk to see if this is something they&apos;d consider, and will update if we hear back.</p>
