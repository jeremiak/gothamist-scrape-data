Architecture nerds, curious early risers, news crews, the new home owners, and architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown were all on hand to witness the journey, which began in New Jersey. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141937/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/nyregion/14lieb.html">The NY Times</a> even talked to a woman who took residence there for two summers in the 1970s. It&apos;s difficult to track down any interior shots of the 1,500-square-footer, but one onlooker today told us Venturi created a home for his mother as well, which he said was filled with very ornate detail. </p>

<p>Robert Gottkin and Debbie Sarnoff will now use the iconic piece of architecture, circa 1969, as a guest house on their Glen Cove property. It reportedly reached its new property just before 1 p.m. this afternoon, after traveling about an estimated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141937/http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/090310liebhouse.asp">75 miles</a>.</p>
