And here we go again! Mr. Kiernan (who if you didn&apos;t know by now, is Canadian) just sent over his newly updated tips for celebrating Canada Day as a New Yorker (it&apos;s this Thursday, July 1st). And you&apos;ll want to scroll down for more information on how to win poutine with Pat later this month!<br>
<ul><li><strong>Go skating</strong><br>
By that I mean &quot;ice skating.&quot; But in Canada nobody says &quot;ice&quot; in front of skating because it&apos;s assumed that&apos;s what you mean. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://www.cityicepavilion.com/schedules/public-skating-schedule/">The City Ice Pavillion</a> in Long Island City keeps the pond frozen year-round and offers public skating on the 1st from 11:30 am to 1:50 pm.<br>
</li><li><strong>Drive to the border</strong><br>
Most every Canadian city has a fireworks display at sunset on July 1st. If there&apos;s still time for you to make the 7-hour drive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://www.niagaraparks.com/attractions/fireworks.html">to Niagara Falls</a>, the fireworks over the water are pretty. And you can see them from the American side if you don&apos;t want to cross the border.<br>
</li><li><strong>Listen to Canadian music</strong><br>
There&apos;s more to Canadian music than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">Bieber Fever</a>. Joe&apos;s Pub hosts the annual &quot;Great Canadian Songbook&quot; event at 7:30 and 9:30 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,5230">on July 1st</a>.<br>
</li><li><strong>Find Canadian food</strong><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://www.lepescadeux.com/">La Pescadeux</a> (90 Thompson Street) invited me to try a Canada Day prix-fixe menu on Thursday, featuring Quebec Tourtiere and Grand Bank Flounder. In Brooklyn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://www.mileendbrooklyn.com/">Mile End</a> has been making its mark by serving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/27/canadian_bagels.php">Montreal-style bagels</a> and smoked meat. And after bringing in some Canadian executives to improve its private label offerings, Duane Reade has become secret source for a favorite Canadian supermarket cookie. The &quot;Delish&quot; chocolate chip cookie sold at Duane Reade is better known in Canada as the President&apos;s Choice &quot;Decadent&quot; cookie.<br>
</li><li><strong>Find Canadian drink</strong><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/listings/bars/neighborhood/lorimer/ontario">Ontario Bar</a> in Williamsburg has Molson, Labatt and Moosehead beer chilling for you now. Or if it&apos;s a hot beverage you&apos;re craving, head to one of the city&apos;s new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035456/http://www.timhortons.com/us/en/index.html">Tim Hortons</a> coffee shops.</li></ul><strong>CONTEST ALERT:</strong> In mid-July we&apos;ll be joining Pat at Mile End for some poutine, and we want to invite a few of you!
