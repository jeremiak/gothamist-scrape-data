                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpq9E8zEPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194630im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpq9E8zEPM.jpg" width="640" height="329" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>As children went hungry, as the nation&apos;s homeless crowded into shelters, as the Thailand protests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194630/http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/26/world/asia/thailand-protests/">turned violent</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194630/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/03/why-are-the-monarch-butterflies-disappearing/">monarch butterflies died</a>, and all the screenings of <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> were sold out in advance... a 26-year-old in Manhattan went without a tree on Christmas day.</p>

<p>Bee Shaffer posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194630/http://instagram.com/p/iWo1QGAMfS/">this photo</a> on Instagram, declaring: &quot;My mom threw out our tree before Christmas Day because &apos;it was too messy&apos;.&quot; And all that was left were hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of presents.</p>

<p>And since her mom is Vogue editrix and <em>stickler for details</em> Anna Wintour, Shaffer&apos;s Christmas Day Nightmare may become next Christmas&apos;s Hot New Trend. Look at that, cool young creative Mindy Kaling already commented: &quot;That is so much more memorable than having a tree! I&apos;m doing that next year.&quot;</p>
