<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Milosz Pierwola, who filmed the video and posted on his site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150149/http://worldin360.com/2015/12/360-video-subway-breakdancing/">worldin360.com</a>, tells us why he shoots experiences like this: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I take the footage I produce and put it into two VR Headsets that I then take to hospitals, inpatient care centers, and other places with people who would otherwise not get out on such adventures. I do this all on my own time and for free. Since I left my job in NYC as an attorney and started to chase the locations around the world I only read about, I have wanted to share my experiences because I can&apos;t put them into words. With this technology, I found a way to bring a smile to the faces of those who would never be able to climb a mountain or surf a wave.&quot;</blockquote>
