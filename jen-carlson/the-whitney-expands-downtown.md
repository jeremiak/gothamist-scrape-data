Lauder (to the tune of $131 million). The donation came with a caveat -- they wouldn&apos;t be able to sell their Marcel Breuer building on Madison Avenue; however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172934/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05022008/news/regionalnews/meatpack_museum_109088.htm">it looks like</a> they received the funding they needed to move forward with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172934/http://www.whitney.org/www/downtown_building_project/index.jsp">a satellite museum in the Meatpacking District</a>.</p>

<p>The downtown building, pictured, was designed by Renzo Piano and is set to be larger than the 32,000-square-foot Madison Avenue outlet; with <strong>50,000-square-feet of gallery space spanning six floors</strong>. In addition to the gallery space, there will also be a restaurant, cafe, bookstore, education facility, research library and a multi-use space. </p>

<p>The Whitney&apos;s downtown site will be at Gansevoort and Washington Streets, though final negotiations are still underway. If all goes as planned, construction will start next year and be completed sometime in 2012.</p>
