<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140038/http://gothamist.com/tags/5pointz">5Pointz</a> in danger of getting demolished as soon as next year&#x2014;to make way for a luxury apartment building, of course&#x2014;it may be a good idea to visit the &quot;Institute of Higher Burnin&quot; again, or for the first time if you haven&apos;t already. In the below video you&apos;ll get a taste of what the site has to offer, from curator and Queens native Meres One... it goes way beyond tagged walls.</p>

<p>You can check out the place on your own, or you can hit up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140038/http://www.sidetour.com/experiences/explore-the-epicenter-of-graffiti-culture-at-5pointz-aerosol-art-center?utm_source=Vimeo&amp;utm_medium=Gothamist&amp;utm_campaign=Editorial">this SideTour experience</a>, where for $35 you&apos;ll get a guided tour from Meres One, who will tell you about the history of 5Pointz, its purpose, and &quot;its strong ties to the music community (Joan Jett, Joss Stone and Mobb Deep have all been known to pay visits).&quot; Meres will also give a live demo of his own work, and bring you to the rooftop of the &quot;largest, legal, aerosol art exhibit space in the United States.&quot;</p>
