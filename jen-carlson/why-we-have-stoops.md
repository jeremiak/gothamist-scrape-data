<p>It may be stinking hot outside, but at least the streets aren&apos;t covered in horse manure... as was the case in late 1800s New York City. Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002025654/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1ihf1g/ever_wonder_why_nyc_has_a_lot_of_brownstone/">a Redditor</a> posted a page from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002025654/http://www.amazon.com/SuperFreakonomics-Cooling-Patriotic-Prostitutes-Insurance/dp/0060889586"><em>Superfreakonomics</em></a>, which recalled a time that five million pounds of manure was being dumped on city streets every day. In 2009 the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002025654/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/11/16/091116crbo_books_kolbert"><em>New Yorker</em></a> noted that it was &quot;predicted that by 1930 horse manure would reach the level of Manhattan&#x2019;s third-story windows.&quot; And that is why stoops were so very necessary.</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;In vacant lots, horse manure was piled as high as sixty feet. It lined city streets like banks of snow. In the summer time, it stank to the heavens; when the rains came, a soupy stream of horse manure flooded the crosswalks and seeped into people&#x2019;s basements. Today, when you admire old New York brownstones and their elegant stoops, rising from street level to the second-storey parlour, keep in mind that this was a design necessity, allowing a homeowner to rise above the sea of horse manure.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>And with that manure came billions of flies, rats, and other vermin that were host to disease. So as you sit on your stoop and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002025654/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/09/behold_the_brand_loophole_that_stym.php">illegally drink</a> a beer tonight, complaining about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002025654/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/oppressively_hot_and_humid_today_co.php">incessant heat</a>, think about how it could be so much worse.</p>
