                            <p>Clinton Hall recently opened their doors on Washington Street in Lower Manhattan, just a few blocks from 1WTC, and not far from Battery Park, which was an inspiration of sorts for the Hall&apos;s creators. The &quot;upscale beer hall pays homage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041436/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/did_you_know_castle_clinton_was_ame.php">America&#x2019;s first beer garden in Battery Park</a>,&quot; we were told prior to the opening.</p>

<p>The 200-seat, 4,000-square-foot Hall has both indoor and outdoor seating, and features a ton of beer, naturally. Choices include ten &quot;super craft beers&quot; and twenty draught beers and ciders on rotation, &quot;ranging from cask ales to keg-conditioned ales and lagers from the US, Belgium, Germany, Scandinavia and beyond.&quot; Beers range from $8 to $17, with cocktails starting at $12, and wine at $8.50 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041436/http://clintonhallny.com/clintonhall/wp-content/menus-2013-08-01/Clinton-Hall-Menus/Clinton-Hall-Drink-Menu.pdf">here&apos;s the drink menu</a>).</p>

<p>They&apos;ve also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041436/http://clintonhallny.com/clintonhall/wp-content/menus-2013-08-01/Clinton-Hall-Menus/Clinton-Hall-Dinner-Menu.pdf">got food</a> to soak it all up with, including Bratwurts ($8), Burgers (classic, veggie and salmon, starting at $12), Spaetzle and and the classic beer hall snack of Soft Pretzels ($4). For the healthy, there&apos;s a Kale Salad ($6+). And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041436/http://clintonhallny.com/clintonhall/wp-content/menus-2013-08-01/Clinton-Hall-Menus/Clinton-Hall-Brunch-Menu.pdf">for brunch</a> they&apos;re only offering a Belgian Waffle ($12) and a Granola &amp; Yogurt dish ($10) for now.</p>

<p>So far the place is getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041436/http://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-new-york">dismal reviews</a>, but maybe it just needs some time to work out the kinks.<br>
