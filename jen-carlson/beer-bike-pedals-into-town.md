<p>As far as marketing ideas go, this one may just take the beer-battered cake. May 15th marks a Dutch invasion of the Upper West Side in celebration of Dutch heritage, and the Amsterdam-brewed Amstel Light has kicked in with a takeover of Amsterdam Avenue on that day. They&apos;ll be giving away 150 bicycles (which should never be driven after imbibing their brew), offering up drink specials, and doing other things that aren&apos;t nearly as amazing as their &quot;unique 10-person &quot;Beer Bike&quot;! Best worst idea <em>ever</em>? Come watch the drunks fall off one by one. (Hope Amstel got insurance!)</p>

<p>This all takes place on Amsterdam Ave. bet 73rd &amp; 74th St. starting at 2 p.m., with drink specials at pubs all along Amsterdam Ave (72 St.&#x2013;86 St.) from 5:00&#x2013;8:00 pm.</p>
