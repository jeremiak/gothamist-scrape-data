They&apos;ll be turning parts of Meserole Avenue, Jewel and Moultrie Streets into Nola&apos;s Ninth this weekend, when they&apos;ll film scenes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102739/http://www.hbo.com/treme/index.html"><em>Treme</em></a>, a story of Ninth Ward residents &quot;attempting to rebuild their lives after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.&quot; According to the sign the filming will take place Friday to Saturday, from 7 p.m. to 8 a.m., and will involve characters walking and talking on the streets. If you stumble upon the set, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102739/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us photos</a>! <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Oh well, an HBO rep tells us, &quot;While the series is set in New Orleans, the particular scene(s) being filmed this weekend are actually set in New York. So, to clear it up, it&#x2019;s not New York being made out to look like New Orleans in any capacity.&quot;</p>
