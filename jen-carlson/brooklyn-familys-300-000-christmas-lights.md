According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145933/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/12/06/2010-12-06_house_in_canarsie_has_been_capturing_the_spirit_of_the_holidays_since_1963_the_l.html">the Daily News</a>, the Seddio family in Canarsie has been brightening up the neighborhood with their annual display since 1963. They&apos;re giving Clark Griswold a little competition, with 250,000 lights, dancing reindeer, elves and talking Santas; this year they added a wreath with 11,000 lights to the roof of the house. Think you can see it from space?<p></p>

<p>64-year-old Frank Seddio told the paper, &quot;We have enough electric power in this house to probably light up the whole block. At any given time, we&apos;re using enough [amps] to light the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.&quot; Since the tradition began decades ago, the display has tripled in size. Seddio&apos;s favorite piece is still one of his oldest, however, a cat in a santa hat popping out of a trash can.</p>

<p>Over the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145933/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/williamsburg/?p=50040">Miss Heather</a> noticed a Williamsburg service station that caught the Christmas light bug. Have you spotted any crazy holiday decorations around town? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145933/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">Send us</a> your photos or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr!</p>
