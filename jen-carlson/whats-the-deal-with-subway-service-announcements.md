                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="seinfeldsubway0410.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901175938im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/seinfeldsubway0410.jpg" width="350" height="263" class="image-left"> </span>Can you hear them now? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901175938/http://www.straphangers.org/announcements10/index.html">Straphangers Campaign</a> just released their survey results on subway service announcements, which found that 55% of the time when service is disrupted announcements are either not made, too garbled to understand, or just totally inaccurate. And this is actually a 10% improvement from their last study in 2006! </p>

<p>Your best shot of hearing an announcement is on the 4/5/6, L, M or N trains&#x2014;which got the best ratings; the worst announcement quality was found on the D, G and 7 trains. Oddly enough, the basic in-car announcements (transfer points, station names, etc) were found to be more than 80% clear and accurate throughout the system. </p>

<p>The Campaign&apos;s Jason Chin-Fatt points out, &#x201C;Poor announcements can mean missed stops, longer trips and a lot more stress.&quot; Hear hear! But what&apos;s the MTA New York City Transit gonna do about it? NYCT&apos;s Paul Fleuranges told us this morning, &quot;We are continuing the effort to improve communications with our customers in all areas. While the inclusion of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901175938/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/04/subway_voices.php">digitized voice announcements</a> on our newer subway car classes has made a huge difference in quality, we are also working to make certain that train crews keep customers informed when issues arise that may affect their trips.&quot;</p>

<p>The study was taken between February 3 and July 11 2009&#x2014;check out how your line did after the jump.</p>
