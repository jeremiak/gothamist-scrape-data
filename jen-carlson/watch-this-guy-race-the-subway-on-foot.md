<p>Matthew Ahn, the lawyer and subway enthusiast who set the Guinness World Record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195402/http://nypost.com/2016/07/23/nycs-fastest-subway-rider-beats-his-own-all-stations-speed-record/">in 2016</a> for the fastest time to hit all 468 NYC subway stations (in 21 hours, 49 minutes and 35 seconds), is back at it. But this time he&apos;s racing the subway. </p>

<p>After seeing a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195402/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1120474/Man-RACES-Tube-Mansion-House-Cannon-Street-WINS.html">race London&apos;s Tube trains</a>, Ahn set out to do the same, albeit on a smaller scale&#x2014;he wrote on Reddit that after &quot;I saw the Tube video [I] speculated about potential places in the NYC system where the same might be possible.&quot; He ended up racing the 2/3 from Chambers Street to Park Place, which is around 5 blocks (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195402/https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Chambers+St+%26+W+Broadway,+New+York,+NY+10007/Canyon+of+Heroes+%26+Park+Pl,+New+York,+NY+10007/@40.7140316,-74.0095315,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a1f2049a9bd:0xf43f66695dc566ee!2m2!1d-74.0092162!2d40.7155081!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a189395b907:0xdcf2bef971ff360d!2m2!1d-74.0076695!2d40.7125552!3e2">0.3 miles</a>). Google Maps tracks the subway ride at around 2 minutes, and both the train and Ahn made it just under that time.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect an encore, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508195402/https://www.facebook.com/incompetentia/videos/vb.15502689/10100707154229206/?type=2&amp;theater">Ahn says</a> he&apos;s &quot;done with subway things for a while.&quot;</p>
