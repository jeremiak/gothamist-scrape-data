The Observer has an article that, upon reading it, appears to have been written two years ago. &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150301200612/http://www.observer.com/20070129/20070129_Chris_Shott_media_observatory.asp">Blog Ghetto</a>&quot; scratches the surface of a scene that&apos;s been around for quite a while, and uncovers things such as: bloggers sometimes hang out with each other...and drink...at The Magician (and other &quot;Hell Square&quot; watering holes). The profile on the scene makes it seem very 90210-esque, even calling The Magician &quot;Blogger High&apos;s Peach Pit&quot; and picking out a Dylan McKay-esque resident stud (apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150301200612/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/11/16/aj_daulerio_odd_1.php">A.J. Daulerio</a>). 

</p><p>There is nothing mentioned of the drugs, the glaring hostilities between the different blog crews and what happens after The Magician closes. Sure there is reference to hook-ups and drug use (&quot;one professional blogger confessed to The Observer her burning desire to somehow &apos;smoke pot and snort coke at the same time.&apos;&#x201D;), and the illicit &quot;hot tub incident&quot; (&quot;One regular, however, did report an illicit hot-tub soak involving some of the city&#x2019;s better-known bloggers, which resulted in their expulsion from the Hotel on Rivington&quot;)...but there&apos;s a lot unwritten between those lines (we suppose they are best not blogged about). </p>

<p>Of note: The hot tub incident included our very own Jake Dobkin (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150301200612/http://www.flickr.com/photos/dpstyles/178412433/">photo</a>), which may be why he was answering The Observer&apos;s questions via email (dude was totally blacklisted after that). </p>
