<p>This afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://twitter.com/#!/kanyewest/status/41186753318494208">Kanye Tweeted</a> this photo, declaring: &quot;Set off the metal detectors with the Swag.&quot; [Ed. note: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23humblebrag">#humblebrag</a>!] Guess Mr. West doesn&apos;t like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/24/bloomberg_get_over_yourself_and_let.php">full-body image scanning</a> and went straight for unloading his bling into a bin. It&apos;s unclear at press time whether or not his massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/08/kanye_visits_tut.php">King Tut necklace</a> needed its own ticket (we like to imagine he doesn&apos;t leave home without it). The takeaway here though is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/10/20/kanye-west-teeth-gold-diamond/">diamond teeth</a> won&apos;t set off any alarms, and that&apos;s knowledge we can all use.</p>

<p>Yesterday Kanye gave a heads up about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/kanye_west_warns_about_high_cost_of.php">high abortion costs</a> to his fellow ballers, and declared this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/watch_this_bizarre_rap_group_odd_fu.php">Odd Future</a> video for &quot;Yonkers&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114441/http://twitter.com/#!/kanyewest/status/40608359346348032">the video of the year</a>: </p>
