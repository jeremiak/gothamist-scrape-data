<p>The Federal style columned veranda that Truman Capote used to sit upon while penning prose now officially belongs to Dan Houser, the co-founder of Rockstar Games (what would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174533/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/30/gta_iv.php#photo-1">Peter Vallone, Jr.</a> say?). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174533/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/25/brooklyn_heights_residents_offended.php">Brooklyn Heights</a> home was on the market until recently, when Houser scooped it up for $12.5 million&#x2014;the most expensive real estate deal in Brooklyn history, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174533/http://www.observer.com/2012/03/a-rockstar-record-grand-theft-auto-creator-dan-houser-buys-truman-capote-mansion-for-12-5-m/">the Observer</a>, who likens Houser to Herman Melville and Grand Theft Auto to <em>Moby Dick</em>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174533/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nyEouhMepvsJ:www.sothebyshomes.com/nyc/openhouses/63420+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">the listing</a>, there are 18 rooms, 11 bedrooms, 7 full baths and 1 half bath, taking up about 9,000 square-feet. Sotheby&#x2019;s broker Karen Heyman talked about the home, located at 70 Willow Street, noting its &#x201C;38 windows with east, south, and west exposures, including parlor floor Jeffersonian floor-to-ceiling pocket windows and French doors,&quot; and describing it as a &quot;quiet refuge&quot;... which doesn&apos;t exactly sound like a place that would fit into Liberty City, the five borough city created by Houser &amp; Co. for Grand Theft Auto IV. How long before he sets up a brothel/drug den and burns the place down?</p>
