<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="deadco15.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151212163702im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/deadco15.jpg" width="350" height="260" class="image-right"> </span>The Grateful Dead played their last shows in 1995. Then again earlier this year, at their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151212163702/http://chicagoist.com/tags/faretheewell">Fare Thee Well</a> concerts. And now, again, right here in New York City. This time around Dead members Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Bob Weir are adding John Mayer to the mix, and rebranding as: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151212163702/http://www.deadandcompany.com/">Dead &amp; Company</a>. </p>

<p>This will happen on Halloween at Madison Square Garden, <em>sans</em> bassist Phil Lesh, who will be performing at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester that night, just 40 miles away. Today&apos;s press release announced the band &quot;will perform two sets of music drawing largely from the Dead&#x2019;s historic catalog of songs.&quot; Here&apos;s what the Core 3 + Mayer had to say:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;There is a place where music, dreams and magic come together. Grateful Dead music is a portal to that place. It was built to last!&#x201D; &#x2014; Mickey Hart
</li><li>&quot;Fare Thee Well proved to me that I&apos;m not done exploring new rhythmic territory with Mickey &#x2014; I&#x2019;m recommending that everyone puts their helmet on, because we are going to blast our way into some serious drums and space. And with Mayer riding shotgun with Weir &#x2014; we&#x2019;re in good company, so to speak.&#x201D; &#x2014; Bill Kreutzmann
</li><li>&quot;We&apos;re not done with these songs and they&apos;re not done with us. We&apos;re gonna take these old friends on some new adventures.&#x201D; &#x2014; Bob Weir
</li><li>&#x201C;I deeply love the Dead&#x2019;s music, and it has inspired me in ways I never imagined. To help carry this music is the opportunity and the honor of a lifetime.&quot; &#x2014; John Mayer</li></ul>
 
Allman Brothers&#x2019; bassist Oteil Burbridge and Fare Thee Well and RatDog keyboardist Jeff Chimenti will also be on hand. 
 
Tickets will go on-sale to the general public Friday, August 14th at 10 a.m. via Ticketmaster.
