<p>Just about a year ago the American Museum of Natural History started to invite adults over to spend the night, an opportunity that had previously only been made available to children. Since adults will get drunk and do dumb things near priceless dinosaur bones. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132257/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/02/sleeping_under_the_amnhs_giant_blue.php">We attended the inaugural sleepover for adults</a>, and nothing went wrong, so the Museum added more. Currently, they have three scheduled through the end of the year, and tickets are still available. </p>

<p>The sleepovers will take place Saturday August 1st, Friday October 2nd, and Saturday December 19th. These being at 6:30 p.m. and you&apos;ll be sent packing the following day at 9 a.m. These sleepovers are for the 21+ set, and are billed as &quot;a more sophisticated version&quot; of the kids&apos; sleepovers. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The overnight adventure will begin with a champagne reception and music provided by the 12th Night Jazz trio in the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall. Explorers can expect to roam through the nearly empty halls of the Museum, where they might run into a herd of elephants in the Akeley Hall of African Mammals or come face to face with looming dinosaur skeletons, including a 65-million-year-old Tyrannosaurs rex. As the evening winds down, guests will be able to unroll their sleeping bags and curl up under the beloved 94-foot-long blue whale in the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life. This is a one-of-a-kind evening that offers visitors an intimate adventure of discovery that is unlike anything they have ever experienced.&quot;</blockquote>

And while there are flashlight tours and live animal exhibitions, you&apos;ll also want to carve out some time to explore the place on your own. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132257/http://gawker.com/night-at-the-boozeum-handjobs-and-spiders-at-nycs-best-1615043426">Or with a friend</a>.</p>
