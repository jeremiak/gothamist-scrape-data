At around 10 p.m. last night Mangum, donning one of his trademark sweaters, arrived unannounced&#x2014;after finishing his first song, he told the crowd: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to serve you. What do you want to hear?&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503012956/http://www.youaintnopicasso.com/2011/10/04/jeff-mangum-playing-at-occupy-wall-st-watch-it-live/">Here&apos;s what he delivered</a>:</p>

<p>1. Themselves (Minutemen cover)<br>
2. Holland, 1945<br>
3. Ghost<br>
4. Song Against Sex<br>
5. Two-Headed Boy pt. 2<br>
6. In the Aeroplane Over the Sea<br>
7. King of Carrot Flowers pt. 1<br>
8. Oh Comely</p>

<p>You can watch the full thing via the Livestream video&#x2014;where he introduces himself, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m Jeff from the band Neutral Milk Hotel,&quot; and tells the protesters, &#x201C;You guys have done a beautiful fucking thing.&quot; (They tell him in unison: &#x201C;<em>You</em> have done a beautiful fucking thing!&#x201D;) Goosebump-generating footage below:</p>

<p>Here he is being accompanied by the protesters, who (for better or worse!) enjoyed singing along.</p>
