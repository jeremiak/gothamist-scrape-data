<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144456/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/28/apple_store_cube_currently_being_ri.php">In June</a> we saw that Apple began to work out some issues with its iconic cube on 5th Avenue, to the tune $6.6 million... though it wasn&apos;t very clear what the problems were. At the time, planning documents revealed that the company be making upgrades to the surrounding plaza structure, before reinstalling the cube. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144456/http://www.macrumors.com/2011/08/09/apple-reveals-fifth-avenue-cube-plans-larger-seamless-glass-panes/">MacRumors</a> reports back with a photo. The company has now revealed the plan on their temporary facade, and they sent us over this new rendering and plant. Though it turns out nothing is wrong with the old cube, they want to simplify it, and &quot;by using larger, seamless pieces of glass, we&apos;re using just 15 panes instead of 90.&quot;</p>
