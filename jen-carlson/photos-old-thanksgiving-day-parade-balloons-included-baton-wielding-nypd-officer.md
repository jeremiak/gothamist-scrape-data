</div></div>					<p>Since we last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151215213129/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/26/flashback_old_time_thanksgiving_day.php">looked back</a> at the Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons of yesteryear, some new images have popped up online. Click through for an assortment of balloons from the black &amp; white days, along with some (in color) video footage from the 1940 parade below. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151215213129/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/the-strangest-macys-parade-balloons-ever/">Ephemeral NY</a> focused on some of the stranger balloon choices of the past, including an NYPD officer holding a baton, saying, &quot;in 1937, a cop appeared in balloon form at the parade... I wonder how that would go over today.&quot; </p>
