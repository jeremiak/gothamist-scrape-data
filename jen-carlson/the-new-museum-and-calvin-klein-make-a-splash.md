title: The New Museum and Calvin Klein Make a Splash
---

	
										<p>Notice anything funny about the Calvin Klein billboard below? No, not the hot pink splashing. The giant ad that hangs above Lafayette and Houston has a secret in the &quot;negative space&quot; left by the splashed paint. The silhouette is of the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155523/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/14/the_new_museum.php">New Museum</a> building on Bowery. Here is what the billboard looked like over the past few days up until last night: </p>

<p>And as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155523/http://www.joshspear.com/item/calvin-klein-x-droga-5-x-the-new-museum/">Josh Spear</a> pointed out yesterday a &quot;stage 3 reveal&quot; took place sometime overnight, making the billboard currently look a little less abstract:  </p>

<p>The two establishments joined forces for an art-fashion splashstravaganza...now that&apos;s what we call synergy! We&apos;re just happy they didn&apos;t pair up with American Apparel. Here&apos;s what the New Museum told us: </p>

<p>&quot;As part of our ad launch campaign produced by Droga 5, the New Museum has partnered with Calvin Klein on an unconventional initiative that seemed consistent with the museum&#x2019;s focus upon new art and new ideas.  Since Monday, the famed Calvin Klein billboard on Houston at Lafayette has been &#x201C;defaced&#x201D; with pink paint and today, the drips have revealed the shape of the building and our new brand, announcing our public opening on Dec. 1st.  The co-branded billboard will remain in place until December 3rd.  Calvin Klein Collection has partnered with the New Museum for the first major campaign preview celebrating the Museum&#x2019;s new home on the Bowery.&quot;</p>
