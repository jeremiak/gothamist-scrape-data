<p>Director Garry Marshall has really <em>nailed</em> that film genre where you just cram as many celebrities into one thinly-plotted, sappy rom-com. First he did it with <em>Valentine&apos;s Day</em>, and now comes his follow-up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604191551/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/2012_arrives_early_in_times_square.php"><em>New Year&apos;s Eve</em></a>. Before you hate-watch the entire movie one hungover Sunday afternoon in December, check out the trailer now. We have embedded it below, where it has likely been calling to you like a siren. Go ahead, click play, but be warned: while you may be enticed by the Josh Duhamel-narration, or the pumping generic pop song, or the old man waxing poetic about serendipity, or sad Ashton with a beard... keep in mind that this is just a 1 minute and 58 second advertisement for false hope. Be strong! Watch <em>Love Actually</em> instead!</p>
