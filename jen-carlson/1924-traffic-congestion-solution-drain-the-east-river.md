<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143755/http://books.google.com/books?id=FSkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true">this issue of <em>Popular Science</em></a>, circa 1924, there&apos;s an article discussing New York&apos;s traffic problem &#x2014; which at the time was reportedly causing the city to lose over $1M a day. One proposed solution: drain the East River and convert it into a 5-mile system accommodating roadways and the subway, while also providing parking spaces in garages and housing city centers.</p>

<p>The idea was that of the deputy police commissioner of traffic at the time, John Harriss. If it had been carried out, there would have been a dam put up near the Williamsburg Bridge, as well as at Hell Gate... and an &quot;imposing City Hall&quot; would be placed midway through the thoroughfare.   And of course, they&apos;d have to run a canal straight through the middle of Western Brooklyn and Queens to accommodate shipping &#x2014; that might have put a crimp in the gentrification of Williamsburg and Long Island City.  </p>
