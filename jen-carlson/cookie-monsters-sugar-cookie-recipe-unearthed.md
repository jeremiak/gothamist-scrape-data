Unearthed from <em>Big Bird&apos;s Busy Book</em>, circa the 1970s, here is Cookie Monster&apos;s famous cookie dough recipe, which is for a sugar cookie.

In this wonderful set of books me going to show you how to make all kinds of cookies! But first... me tell you secret recipe for Cookie Dough (it&apos;s been in my family for years.)&quot;</p>
