<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165400/http://gothamist.com/tags/yeahyeahyeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> video filmed atop the Empire State Building&apos;s observation deck (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165400/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/21/yeah_yeah_yeahs_filmed_1st_music_vi.php">the first ever music video filmed there</a>!) is now out, and available below for your viewing pleasure. Karen O spoke about the shoot, saying, &quot;There&apos;s been a lot of career highs and lows over the years of being in a band, but in the end, how many can say they shot a video on the top of the Empire State Building? We win. Move out the way, King Kong, Yeah Yeah Yeahs are gonna get real with you up in this piece!&#x201D; It&apos;s certainly a long way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165400/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/16/old_shows_at_brownies.php">from Brownies</a>... but what would have been <em>really</em> impressive is if there were some shots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165400/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/06/empire_state_building.php#photo-1">from the vertigo-inducing 103rd floor</a>.</p>

<p>The video for &quot;Despair&quot; was directed by Patrick Daughters, who also shot their earlier videos for &#x201C;Maps&#x201D; and &#x201C;Gold Lion.&#x201D;</p>
