<p>The Brooklyn Botanic Garden&apos;s web manager Dave Allen has taken to timelapsing different areas of the space. Today he&apos;s released a new one of the Lily Pool Terrace (in the past he&apos;s given the same treatment to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140236/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/29/brooklyn_botani.php">the cherry blossoms</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140236/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/19/video_of_the_day_rose_timelapse_at.php">the Cranford Rose Garden</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140236/http://www.bbg.org/news/lily_pool_time-lapse">He writes</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Lily Pool Terrace turned out to be an excellent subject. The water-lilies open and close daily. The sacred lotus unfurl their gigantic flowers and then drop their petals. The sky and nearby buildings are reflected in the still waters of the pool. Photographers practically dive in, setting their high-powered, expensive lenses within inches of their subjects.</blockquote>

<p>The video was taken over the course of seven days at the beginning of July. Enjoy!</p>
