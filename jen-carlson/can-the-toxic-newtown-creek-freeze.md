<p>Recently photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183359/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/">Nate Kensinger</a> headed to the &quot;desolate industrial wasteland&quot; that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183359/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2011/02/newtown-creek-brooklyn-shores.html">Newtown Creek</a>. Last year it was declared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183359/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/28/newtown_creek.php">a Superfund site</a> by the Environmental Protection Agency, who called it &quot;one of the nation&#x2019;s most polluted waterways.&quot; So we were wondering: does a watery toxic wasteland like this <em>freeze</em> in the winter? The above photo holds the answer: not really! Fine, maybe it&apos;s thawed... but we&apos;re told Prospect Park Lake is still mostly frozen.</p>
