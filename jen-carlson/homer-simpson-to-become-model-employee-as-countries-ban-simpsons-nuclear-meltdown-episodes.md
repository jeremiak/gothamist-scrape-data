<span class="photo_caption">Plenty of non-offensive headlines <em>The Simpsons</em> can work with (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152105/http://www.funnyordie.com/slideshows/c6258485b4/the-best-simpsons-headlines">via</a>)</span></p>

<p>Homer Simpson&apos;s stupidity is now officially insulting. In Germany, Switzerland and Austria episodes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152105/http://gothamist.com/tags/thesimpsons"><em>The Simpsons</em></a> featuring the character&apos;s more disastrous power plant antics will be taken off the air in the wake of Japan&apos;s nuclear crisis. Broadcasters there have been screening episodes to make sure one featuring a meltdown doesn&apos;t hit the air.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152105/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/simpsons-nuclear-jokes-edited-germany-171415">the Hollywood Reporter</a> two episodes have already been pulled: Episode 66, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152105/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_Gets_a_Job">Marge Gets a Job</a>, featuring scientists Marie and Pierre Curie dying of radiation poisoning; and Episode 346, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152105/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_a_Clear_Day_I_Can&apos;t_See_My_Sister">On a Clear Day I Can&apos;t See My Sister</a>, where jokes about a nuclear meltdown are made. But how about the opening sequence which shows Homer tossing a radioactive fuel rod from his car? Or radioactive Mr. Burns?</p>

<p>Executive producer Al Jean told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152105/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/03/27/simpsons-al-jean-nuclear-japan/">EW</a> that Homer would be keeping his job at the plant, but &quot;We have 480 episodes, and if there are a few that they don&#x2019;t want to air for awhile in light of the terrible thing going on, I completely understand that.&quot; He added that Homer Versus the City of New York (you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152105/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/the_simpsons_predicted_911_accordin.php">this one</a>) was pulled after 9/11.</p>
