<p>In June James Franco said he would be &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926170524/http://omg.yahoo.com/news/james-franco-i-would-be-very-very-sad-if-soaps-went-away/65169">very, very sad</a>&quot; if soap operas died (though they&apos;d probably just go into a coma for a few years and return unexpectedly?). Then in July it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926170524/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/26/james_franco_goes_back_to_the_soaps.php">was announced</a> that Franco would make a return to <em>General Hospital</em>&#x2014;doing his part to save the dying genre! But <em>then</em> (dun dun dun) Franco claimed he was too busy for the soap. So how do you explain this newly released photo of Franco on the set of the show? It&apos;s our first definitive look at a real member of the James Franco Clone Army! Bleeding, just like a real boy.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926170524/http://www.eonline.com/news/first_look_why_james_franco_all_bloody/261045">E! News</a>&#x2014;who channel their inner <em>Tiger Beat</em> and actually use the word &quot;studly&quot; to describe the actor(&apos;s clone)&#x2014;says the Franco plotline will start airing on September 20th, opening with his return to Port Charles &quot;just as Jason Morgan and Samantha McCall are about to become husband and wife. What does he have up his sleeve for the big day?&quot; Well, from the looks of the photo, he&apos;s probably just going to take it easy, maybe get a cappuccino at the local Port Charles coffee shop, maybe do some light reading. (Sorry, spoilers!)</p>
