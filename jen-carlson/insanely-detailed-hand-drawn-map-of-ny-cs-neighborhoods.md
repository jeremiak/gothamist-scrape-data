</div></div>					<p>This hand-drawn map of New York City has been circulating since artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713111410/http://jennisparks.blogspot.com/2012/12/hand-drawn-map-of-new-york.html">Jenni Sparks</a> posted it on her site recently. She notes it was commissioned by Evermade.com, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713111410/http://www.evermade.com/product/hand-drawn-map-of-new-york/">where it&apos;s selling</a> for just around $100, &quot;and was just as hard as the Map of London, if not harder.&quot; Click through for a look... you&apos;ll notice call-outs to <em>Sex and the City</em>, Bob Dylan, &quot;The Independent Republic Of Greenwich Village,&quot; Williamsburg (which dons a large mustache), and more. But you will also notice the absence of much of NYC. Can you find any inaccuracies?</p>
