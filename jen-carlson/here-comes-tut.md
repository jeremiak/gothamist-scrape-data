</div></div>					<p>As mentioned in our indispensable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205115942/http://gothamist.list-manage.com/subscribe/post">daily events newsletter</a>, the 25-foot Egyptian god Anubis has taken over New York waters today. Officials insist this isn&apos;t some sort of Trojan Horse trick or signal that we are all going to be mummified soon&#x2014;it&apos;s merely a promotional tool for the upcoming &#x201C;Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs&#x201D; exhibit (tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205115942/http://www.kingtutnyc.com/">on sale today</a>!). The last time Tutmania hit the city was in 1979, when 1.8 million visitors flocked to see his treasures... and Steve Martin addressed the phenomena on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, calling it a &quot;national disgrace the way we have commercialized it with trinkets and toys, t-shirts and posters.&quot; Watch:</p>

<p>The statue is back near the Brooklyn Bridge right now, and a press conference with former Mayor Ed Koch (who was in office during the last exhibit), will be held at Pier 17 through 11 a.m. If you get a photo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205115942/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send it in</a>!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&apos;re told the statue will be in storage for the next month and will then reappear when the exhibit opens. Anubis may even get a Twitter account so it&apos;s easier to follow his whereabouts!</p>
