<p>Scott Snyder, the writer of Detective Comics (of course), has found a mystery hipster in both Marvel and DC comics. And not just any hipster: <em>the same hipster</em>, in comics illustrated by different artists and put out by different companies. WTF IS GOING ON? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228191256/http://www.ifanboy.com/content/articles/Scott_Snyder_Uncovers_Bizarre_Background_Character_Mystery">iFanBoy</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;On Sunday he started Tweeting that he had noticed that the same two men had been appearing as background character or extras in all the DC and Marvel comics aimed at younger readers. Who are these mystery men who have been appearing in the background of all these comics?&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Snyder offered up many visuals, all showing the same red-haired, bespectacled hipster... sometimes as a cop, sometimes donning a tux or regular street clothes, and always with his soul-patched friend. As of this afternoon, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228191256/http://twitter.com/#!/ssnyder1835">Tweeted</a> that no light was shed on the mystery... yet.
