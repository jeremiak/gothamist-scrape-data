<p>Ready for some man on man action between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon? Well ready or not, Steven Soderbergh and Jerry Weintraub are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081715/http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/10/11/steven-soderbergh-and-jerry-weintraub-bring-michael-douglas-and-matt-damon-to-hbo-for-hbo-films-behind-the-candelabra-306012/20111011hbo01/">about to deliver it</a>. Their movie, which is currently called <em>Behind the Candelabra</em>, promises &quot;a behind-the-scenes look at the tempestuous relationship between legendary entertainer Liberace and Scott Thorson, his younger live-in lover&quot; (there was about a 38 year age difference between them).</p>

<p>Douglas, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081715/http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-pictures-that-show-how-michael-douglas-has-got-cancer-beat-2892369.html">apparently beaten cancer</a>, will play Liberace, of course, and Weintraub says, &quot;I&apos;ve wanted to make a film about Liberace for a very long time... I am thrilled that we have the incomparable Michael Douglas to inhabit the role of Liberace, as well as the exceptional Matt Damon to play the pivotal part of Scott Thorson. Putting these two fine actors in the creative hands of Steven Soderbergh&#x2014;it doesn&apos;t get better than that!&quot;</p>

<p>The movie, based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081715/http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Candelabra-My-Life-Liberace/dp/0525246533">a book</a> of the same name, will air on HBO next summer. Hopefully they will come up with a better title before then?</p>
