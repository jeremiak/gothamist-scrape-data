<p>Ever dream of recreating the summer of 1963, when 17-year-old New Yorker Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman took a family vacation to Kellerman&apos;s Resort in the Catskills? Well, now you&apos;ll never have the opportunity to awkwardly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064420/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x43vK0k6A2I">carry a watermelon</a> into an after-hours staff party, because over the weekend the place was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064420/http://video.msnbc.msn.com/nightly-news/47067379/#47067379">destroyed by a fire</a>. Formerly the Brown&apos;s Hotel, it later became a 396-unit condominium complex, but as its former incarnation it served as (at least one of) the Catskills resorts that inspired the film. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064420/http://entertainment.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/17/11247006-hotel-that-inspired-dirty-dancing-goes-up-in-flames?lite">fire was called</a> the &quot;largest fire in Catskills history,&quot; and in the end burned down 7 of the 9 buildings on the grounds.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064420/http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/new_york/fire-destroys-dirty-dancing-resort">to reports</a> &quot;the condo complex in Loch Sheldrake, 85 miles northwest of New York City, was featured in the movie <em>Dirty Dancing</em>.&quot; However, the movie was chiefly filmed at the Mountain Lake Resort near Roanoke, Virginia (so your reenactment dreams are still sort of alive). The production actually never found anything suitable in the Catskills, since many of the Borscht Belt hotels had been abandoned by the time the movie was filming in the mid-1980s (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064420/http://lightbox.time.com/2011/06/23/the-disappearance-of-the-borscht-belt-hotels/#4">an amazing slide show of the old resorts here</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064420/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090621/COMM/906210329/-1/NEWS">In 2009</a>, a small group of residents at the condo complex, which still contained the old Jerry Lewis Theatre, were fighting for historic status.</p>

<p>SIGH. Jennifer Grey just turned 52. Patrick Swayze is dead. Kellerman&apos;s has burned to the ground. We&apos;re going to go weep for a while, <em>away from the corner</em>.</p>
