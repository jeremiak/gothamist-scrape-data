He recalls his moment of television glory on the big night being when he was &quot;almost hit in the head with a stuffed penguin as the March of the Penguins guys squeezed by on their way to the stage.&quot; Now he&apos;s back for another round with his new documentary Racing Dreams, currently screening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213303/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/Racing_Dreams.html">at Tribeca Film Festival</a>. Delving into the world of 11 to 13 year old World Karting Association auto racers (the prequel to NASCAR), the subject matter couldn&apos;t be further from downtown New York. Recently the Brooklynite told us about the film, the Oscars, and having his hands on some works-in-progress by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213303/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/21/matt_berninger.php">The National</a>.</em><p></p>

<p><strong>How did you end up a filmmaker?</strong> After college I did a bunch of different jobs&#x2014;taught English in Mexico, worked in public radio, worked for a web design company&#x2014;but there was something about documentaries that really attracted me.  I liked the idea of spending time finding out about worlds that I don&#x2019;t know anything about, and I found that I really liked the craft of shooting and editing.  So I did a few short films and then heard about an election that was shaping up in Newark, NJ that was going to be exciting and unlike any of the elections I&#x2019;d ever seen in documentaries.  I bought a camera and started shooting Street Fight.</p>

<p><strong>Which filmmakers do you admire?</strong> I like fiction films and documentaries, but I watch a lot more docs.  I like the verite gang the best&#x2014;Maysles, and Pennebaker/Hegedus, etc.  It&#x2019;s really hard to make a compelling, coherent verite, but when it works, it&#x2019;s unbelievable&#x2014;so powerful and direct.  I also really like Ross McElwee&#x2014;Sherman&#x2019;s March completely shifted my idea of what documentaries could do or be.  But I&#x2019;m not a purist&#x2014;I like films that are narrated and films that aren&#x2019;t, films that are beautiful and films that are clumsy but heartfelt.  Mostly I just like a good story and good characters.</p>

<p><strong>Your second movie is so different from the first, where did you get the idea for this one?</strong> Like most New Yorkers, I didn&#x2019;t know anything about racing before starting this movie.  But I&#x2019;d heard that NASCAR was the #2 spectator sport in the country after football&#x2014;bigger than baseball, bigger than basketball.  And I thought that was interesting&#x2014;that there could be something so huge in my own country that I don&#x2019;t know anything about.  Then I read an article about the World Karting Association which has a series for 11-13 year olds that&#x2019;s sort of like the Little League for NASCAR.  I went to a race to check it out and was blown away&#x2014;12 year olds driving 70mph.  I got home and showed some of the footage to Bristol Baughan who was producing for Reason Pictures/Good Inc, and she green lit it pretty much on the spot.</p>
