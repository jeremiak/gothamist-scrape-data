They&apos;re currently setting up shop at 29th and Broadway, and bringing a Stumptown Coffee (a favorite amongst Pacific Northwesters) with it. The grand opening will be in Winter 08/09, and <strong>it will come with a new restaurant from the people behind The Spotted Pig</strong>. The Ace tell us a little bit about what to expect:</p><blockquote>Ace is the low card and the high card.  Our basic rooms are affordable but replete with cool amenities. Our big suites offer all the luxury you would expect from a high-end hotel. Ace Hotel New York is improvisational, a mix of styles, historical periods and objects that come together in layers. The hotel&#x2019;s design takes its cues from the vibrancy of street life, the honesty of materials and the potential of invention. It is about soul, latent in the old architecture and re-introduced through the new design.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094708/http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2008/8/14/12203/5837/hotels/Super_Secret_Hotel_Insider_Goes_Inside_the_Ace_Hotel_New_York">Hotel Chatter</a> got a first look at the New York Ace, and says the rooms have a residential feel, and the one model room opened included a &quot;full size <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094708/http://www.smeguk.com/catalogue/Fridges.aspx">SMEG refrigerator</a> (think <em>That 70&apos;s Show</em>) <strong>stocked with goods from local NYC names like Brooklyn Brewery</strong>.&quot; They just got some renderings together (below), and to get a real feel what it&apos;s going to be like, check out their rooms in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094708/http://www.acehotel.com/portland/rooms">Portland</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094708/http://www.acehotel.com/seattle/rooms">Seattle</a>...which are nicer, and larger, than some NYC apartments.<p></p> <div class="galleryEase" id="gallery-0">
