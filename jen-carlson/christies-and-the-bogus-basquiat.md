                            <p><img alt="200709basquiat.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215043643im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200709basquiat.jpg" width="343" height="360" class="right">One would think that dropping some serious cash at a high end auction house would be a safe bet. Today it&apos;s being reported that an art dealer in Chelsea did just that and ended up with a counterfeit piece! Christie&apos;s is now being faced with a $7 million lawsuit that charges them with knowingly selling the art dealer a fake Jean-Michel Basquiat painting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215043643/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09192007/gossip/pagesix/7m_suit_over_bogus_basquiat.htm">Page Six</a> reports:</p><blockquote>Tony Shafrazi, who was Basquiat&apos;s primary dealer, says he bought the 1982 untitled piece from Christie&apos;s in 1990 for $242,000, and resold it a year later to collector Guido Orsi.<p></p>

<p>In his suit filed this month in Manhattan Supreme Court, the Iranian-born dealer, who has a gallery on West 26th Street, claims Christie&apos;s knew the painting was a fraud - having been told so earlier by the artist&apos;s Haitian father, Gerard Jean-Baptiste Basquiat - but sold it anyway.</p></blockquote>The Brooklyn-born artist&apos;s pieces are worth a lot these days, and recently an untitled 1981 work sold at Sotheby&apos;s for $14.6 million. The case arose after a Basquiat authentication committee rejected the piece...so we sort of wonder if they got some ideas from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215043643/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/17/warhol.php">the Warhol committee</a>. <p></p>
