<p>Red wine, what can&apos;t you put it in? While plenty of ex<em>spirit</em>menters have introduced red wine to Coke (in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053833/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/15/soda_cocktails.php">kalimotxo</a>), this warming winter mixture is a little less... collegiate. And while Google confirms it&apos;s A Thing, 0 out of 5 staffers currently at Gothamist HQ have heard of it, and responded in horror at the idea of mixing milk with wine&#x2014;but we are brave, and a run for a bottle of red and canister of cocoa powder is planned for around noon. Stay tuned for our colorful afternoon content! But for now, here&apos;s a recipe courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053833/http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Bittersweet-Hot-Chocolate-with-Red-Wine">Saveur</a>:</p>

<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>6 oz. bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped<br>
</li><li>&#x2153; cup fruity red wine, such as Pinot Noir, Shiraz or Beaujolais (we used merlot)<br>
</li><li>1 cup milk<br>
</li><li>Pinch Kosher salt<br>
</li><li>Sugar, for serving<br>
</li><li>Bring chocolate and wine to a simmer in a 1-qt. saucepan over low heat; cook, whisking, until melted, about 3 minutes. Add &#x2154; cup water, milk, and salt; bring to a boil, and cook, while whisking 3 minutes more. Pour into 2 mugs and serve with sugar on the side, if you like.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>That sounds like a lot of work, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053833/http://www.homecookingadventure.com/recipes/hot-chocolate-with-red-wine">here&apos;s a less messy and time-consuming solution</a> with the powdered stuff. And for a more chilled version, try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053833/http://chocovine.com/">ChocoVine</a>... actually, don&apos;t. If you see this in your bodega just leave it there to collect dust:</p>
