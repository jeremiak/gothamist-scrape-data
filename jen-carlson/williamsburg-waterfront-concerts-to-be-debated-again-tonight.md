<p>Two weeks ago, it was proposed at a community board meeting that the waterfront concerts held by the OSA in Williamsburg be moved... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142929/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/07/after_neighbor_complaints_williamsb.php">two blocks</a> from the current location. The proposal was to appease neighbors, who are complaining about the summertime concerts and overflow of attendees into the streets in their neighborhood. After all, it&apos;s all fun and games until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142929/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/video_nitrous_oxide_fueled_fans_ter.php">nitrous-huffing zombies</a> are outside of <em>your</em> window.</p>

<p>While 516 (to 52) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142929/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/concert_attendees_claim_there_was_n.php">of our readers</a> voted that the concerts should be able to stay, the locals were unrelenting, and the proposal was made. But naturally, they&apos;re not happy with the proposal, either. One man declared, &quot;we&#x2019;re still going to be able to hear it. The era of quiet nights on the waterfront is over.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If you want to speak out for or against the move, or the concerts staying in Williamsburg at all, then head over to the Swingin&apos; Sixties Senior Center (211 Ainslie Street, Brooklyn) tonight at 6:30 p.m., to get your voice heard, or to just shake your fist at those pesky kids and their music concerts.</p>
