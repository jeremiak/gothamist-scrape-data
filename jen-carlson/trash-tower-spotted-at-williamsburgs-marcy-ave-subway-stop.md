<p>While the Marcy Avenue J/M/Z stop in Williamsburg isn&apos;t on the current list of subway stations that recently had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160125160144/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/30/will_fewer_mta_trash_cans_mean_fewe.php">their trash cans taken away</a>, it does seem the creative folks of the neighborhood have started to utilize other areas for their trash disposal. (&quot;We were throwing our trash out in places other than trash cans <em>before</em> it was cool.&quot;) A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160125160144/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/zy271/loving_these_new_mta_garbage_cans/">Redditor</a> snapped the above scene, showing a tower of trash growing inside of the elevated train&apos;s support beams.</p>

<p>We contacted the MTA about this, and will update if they have anything to say&#x2014;but really what we need to do is contact The People. Everyone, the trash can is one of civilization&apos;s greatest innovations; please take advantage of them! This is just <em>inviting</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160125160144/http://gothamist.com/tags/ratdemic">a ratdemic</a> to the area.</p>
