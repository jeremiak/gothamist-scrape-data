<p>This greeting comes a bit late, but that&apos;s fitting, no?</p>

<p>Subway, you are reliably just a little bit delayed, crowded, creaky, dysfunctional, smelly, sticky, dirty, too cold, too hot, never just right. You have the least flattering lighting. You&#x2014;the first underground section of NYC&apos;s subway system&#x2014;turned 111 years old yesterday, and you look and function so, so, so much older than that. But perfection is boring, as the great actor Nicolas Cage once said, &quot;I think what makes people fascinating is conflict; it&apos;s drama, it&apos;s the human condition. Nobody wants to watch perfection.&quot; Perfection is rarely experienced in the subway system, but we have witnessed plenty of drama, conflict, the human condition being tested and broken, manspreading, and delays.</p>

<p>So we embrace your flaws, while Tweeting behind your back about them. Especially on weekends, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://gothamist.com/tags/weekendsubwaychanges">what&apos;s up with that</a>?</em></p>

<p>But listen, subway, we&apos;re here to celebrate you. You put up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/is_this_the_most_horrifying_subway.php">A LOT</a>. And you reliably bring us places that we would never be able to get to for such a small price, in such a relatively short amount of time. When we go to other cities, sometimes they don&apos;t even have mass transit. Have you been to DC? Their trains stop running at like, midnight. You&apos;re still bringing people<em> to</em> the club at midnight!</p>

<p>You&apos;ve had a rough life; even when you first opened over a century ago, the press wasn&apos;t impressed. You were met with some pretty insipid reviews&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://www.thenation.com/article/october-27-1904-the-new-york-city-subway-system-opens/">The Nation</a> stated you were: &#x201C;a slight transit improvement.&quot; They&apos;re kind of boring like that, though. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A06EEDF163DE733A2575AC2A9669D946597D6CF">The NY Times</a> simply called you &quot;a public convenience.&quot; Nice, sure, but jesus what do these people want? You are a complex system of tunnels and rails underneath one of the largest cities in the world, helping millions reach their destinations <em>daily</em>. A public convenience?! Open your eyes, dead NY Times reporter. The underground subway system is a goddamn blessing, a miracle&#x2014;you think those tunnels just appeared one day?</p>

<p>And then there was the &apos;80s. Man, remember the &apos;80s? You really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/photo_undercover_nypd_officer_on_th.php">saw some shit</a> that decade. But you also provided a canvas to talented young artists all over the 5 boroughs.</p>

<p>Speaking of art&#x2014;those stations! The Rafael Guastavino-designed City Hall loop is where it all began, and remains (even as a ghost station) THE most elegant subway platform in the entire city, with Romanesque Revival architecture, brass chandeliers, SKYLIGHTS! </p>

<p>Are you an angel, subway? Because this looks like a portal to Heaven.</p>

<p>We will now resume our griping about delays and service changes, but first, an important PSA:</p>

<blockquote><em>If you&apos;ve found your commutes frustrating, tell your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://www.nysenate.gov/senators">state</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/">representatives</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://www.governor.ny.gov/contact">Governor Cuomo</a> to stop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224534/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/22/mta_so_popular_so_broke.php">robbing the MTA of badly needed funding</a> and figure out a way to come up with more cash for a 21st Century transit system.</em></blockquote>

<p>Okay, that&apos;s it, we love you. Even when we&apos;re cursing you.</p>
