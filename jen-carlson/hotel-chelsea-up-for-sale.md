Well, now the hotel is up for sale, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191420/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304410504575560640639784032.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTThirdStories">Wall Street Journal</a>, which reports that &quot;the Chelsea&apos;s 15 shareholders, led by three Hungarian families who bought the 12-story red-brick building in 1946, are selling the property after concluding that the task of modernizing the hotel and apartment building was too challenging.&quot; </p>

<p>One shareholder referred to the liberal rent-collection policies the building has operated under, saying, &quot;<strong>The way we want to run the hotel is not necessarily the way the business world works.</strong>&quot; And speculation is that a buyer could turn the Hotel Chelsea into an upscale destination, the way the Gramercy Park Hotel and Ace Hotel have been made over.</p>
