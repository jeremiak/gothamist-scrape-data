title: It's International Waffle Day, Here's Where To Get Your Waffle Fix In NYC
---

	
										<p>In February the nation celebrated The Pancake, and for our part we told you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204027/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/beyond_clinton_street_where_to_get.php">where to get the best ones in NYC</a>. But today we&apos;re here to celebrate The Waffle, which some tend to believe is a way superior breakfast treat. Happy International Waffle Day, everyone! (This is not to be confused with <em>National</em> Waffle Day, which is celebrated in August. Seriously.) Waffle House has no presence anywhere in the boroughs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204027/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/waffle_day_is_coming_up_and_we_stil.php">and there&apos;s no hope of one coming anytime soon</a>... but they don&apos;t even have good waffles, so we&apos;re okay with that. Here is where you <em>can</em> get your waffle fix today...</p>

<p>They get tons of attention and press, but if you&apos;ve ever tried their offerings, you know it&apos;s for good reason. The <strong>Wafels &amp; Dinges</strong> Truck is observing today with a buy-one-get-one free offer, <em>and</em> they&apos;re celebrating the launch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204027/http://thedinges.blogspot.com/2012/03/international-wafel-day-2012.html">a second truck</a>&#x2014;check it out between 2 and 4 p.m. at 31st &amp; Ditmars Blvd in Astoria, Queens.</p>

<p>For more chicken and waffles in Manhattan, you&apos;ll probably want to head to Harlem, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204027/http://www.melbasrestaurant.com/"><strong>Melba&apos;s</strong></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429204027/http://www.amyruthsharlem.com/dinnermenu/waffles/wafflemenu01.html"><strong>Amy Ruth&apos;s</strong></a> are both known to put out the best of the dish.
