<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219193940/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/boardwalk_empire_2.php">we reported yesterday</a>, last night around 11 p.m. a giant fireball was created on the set of <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>. FDNY Press secretary Frank Dwyer told us this was a &quot;controlled explosion in a confined area... FDNY Explosives Unit issued a permit and will be onsite to monitor the loading, firing and aftermath of the controlled explosion.&quot; And when the professionals get involved, things look a lot more epic. See the video below, where one witness lets out a gutteral and satisfied &quot;YES,&quot; upon seeing the explosion:</p>

<p>Dwyer also told us that &quot;Propane, black powder, rubber cement and air cannons were used to create the controlled explosion.&quot; You can check out a couple more views <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219193940/http://benpopkenwrites.com/post/29618982664/3-videos-of-giant-fireball-last-night-in-greenpoint-for">here</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219193940/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/video/#!/on-air/as-seen-on/Aerial-View--Boardwalk-Empire-Staged-Explosion/166498726">NBC New York</a> actually hovered around in their chopper and caught some great footage as well: </p>
