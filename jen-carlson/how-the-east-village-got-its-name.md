<p>The East Village wasn&apos;t always called that, it was simply part of the Lower East Side until the mid-1960s. At that time the area began changing, with artists getting priced out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/video_spend_a_sunday_in_greenwich_v.php">Greenwich Village</a> and moving into the area, which was mostly populated by working class immigrants. This change came with a rebranding, and the new name was popularized by real estate agents and newcomers. And with that, a wave of gentrification created the East Village&#x2014;a neighborhood that was never officially dubbed that, nor one that has official borders.</p>

<p>In the 1964 guide &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/https://www.amazon.com/Earl-Wilsons-New-York-Wilson/dp/B001AC7J4C">Earl Wilson&apos;s New York</a>&quot; the author declares that &quot;artists, poets and promoters of coffeehouses from Greenwich Village are trying to remelt the neighborhood under the high-sounding name of &apos;East Village.&apos;&quot; Around the same time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/29/the-affluent-set-invades-the-east-village.html?_r=0">The NY Times</a> began using the name, and in 1964 reported that the affluent were taking over the area&#x2014;&quot;When artists and writers be&#xAD;gan in 1960 to move into tene&#xAD;ment housing in what is now called the East Village, the older residents of the Lower East Side greeted them as they had all previous invaders: They fought back. Today, these artists, along with the Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Negroes and Puerto Ric&#xAD;ans who occupied the area be&#xAD;fore them, face a new invasion... The uptown rich.&quot; And so it goes.</p>

<p>The neighborhood also got its own publications, among them was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://eastvillageother.org/the-paper">The East Village Other</a>, which debuted in 1966 (not to be confused with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/20/east_village_other_paper_flashback.php">The Other Paper</a>). While the moniker existed in everyday life, it was never named the East Village in any official way&#x2014;in the 1990s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/nyregion/fyi-649895.html">The NY Times</a> reported it &quot;was never formally bestowed on the area,&quot; but a spokesman for the city&apos;s Department of City Planning told them that &quot;while the East Village is not listed as such in city zoning maps, the term has been recognized by City Planning officials for about 25, 30 years.&quot; </p>

<p>To match its unofficial name, the area also has ambiguous borders. Technically, the East Village doesn&apos;t have any official borders&#x2014;no city expert or agency we reached out to would give us an answer regarding this, most noting there aren&apos;t any official border lines for any NYC neighborhoods. Kate Cordes at the NYPL told us, &quot;Neighborhoods are just crowdsourced knowledge and boundaries are unofficial.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Cordes referred us to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/c42cb93f-8e9e-ca65-e040-e00a18064e5c">a city planning proposal from 1969</a> which states that: &quot;The East Village lies between East 14th Street and Houston Street from the Bowery and Fourth Avenue to the East River.&quot; </p>

<p>We ventured over to Tompkins Square Park recently to ask people on the street to highlight what they believed the borders to be <strong>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/07/east_village_border_map.php">watch that video here</a>, or at the end of this post)</strong>&#x2014;below, a couple of them talk about the old days:</p>

<p>N.B. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_City,_Manhattan">Alphabet City</a> (a neighborhood within the neighborhood) wasn&apos;t a name that came to be until the 1980s, according to urban historian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/https://books.google.com/books?id=NnUjjjjyjOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=peter+g+rowe+civic+realism&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Peter G. Rowe</a>, and it first turned up in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050412/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/opinion/needed-federal-anti-drug-aid.html">the NY Times in 1984</a>, in an editorial by then mayor Ed Koch about crime in the area.</p>

<p>Update: Here is what happened when we asked people in the East Village to highlight the borders of the neighborhood: </p>
