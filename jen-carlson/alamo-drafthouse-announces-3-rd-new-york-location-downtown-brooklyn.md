<p>They haven&apos;t even opened up their first New York location yet, but today the owners of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231123/http://gothamist.com/tags/alamodrafthouse">Alamo Drafthouse</a> announced their third theater here. Adding to their future <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231123/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/05/alamo_draft_house_is_coming_to_the.php">Upper West Side</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231123/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/02/alamo_drafthouse_coming_to_yonkers.php">Yonkers</a> locations, their third theater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231123/http://drafthouse.com/blog/entry/the_drafthouse_announces_a_third_location_in_new_york?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+drafthouseblog+%28Drafthouse+Blog%29#When:17:00:15Z">will be in Downtown Brooklyn</a>.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We&apos;re overjoyed to announce a third New York location opening in the next couple of years, part of our sneaky plan to win over as many boroughs as we possibly can. The newest location will be in the beautiful area of downtown Brooklyn. The seven-screen theater will be located at City Point, a new 1.8 million square foot mixed-use project. The venue will feature seven screens of new releases, repertory programming and the Alamo&#x2019;s unique signature programming in both 35mm and digital formats.  Like all Alamo Drafthouse theaters, Alamo Drafthouse City Point will provide food and drink service to your seat and will uphold its famously strict no-talking policy.  The new theater is currently scheduled to open in 2015.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Alamo Drafthouse Founder and CEO Tim League says, &quot;I am extremely excited about the major development in downtown Brooklyn and proud to be a part of it. Although more than two years on the horizon, I can tell you that the City Point Brooklyn Alamo will be our best theater yet.&quot; The theater, which has its roots in Austin, recently announced a new policy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231123/http://drafthouse.com/blog/entry/latearrivers">regarding late arrivals</a>: &quot;no one will be seated once the film has begun.&quot; It&apos;s unclear if they&apos;ll also be bringing that rule to New York City... where many patrons will be at the mercy of the subway system.</p>
