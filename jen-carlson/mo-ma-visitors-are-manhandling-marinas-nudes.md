										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="nudesatmarina0310.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140414031215im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/nudesatmarina0310.jpg" width="241" height="350" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140414031215/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovic">Marina Ambramovic</a>&apos;s &quot;The Artist Is Present&quot; is still going on at MoMA, and while her silent staring contests have been the center of attention lately, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140414031215/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/marina.php">the nude models</a> positioned at the entryway are speaking out about their silent shifts. </p>

<p>One part of the installation&#x2014;which is a retrospective of the artist&apos;s work&#x2014;includes two naked people standing in a small entryway that museum-goers squeeze through (optional!)&#x2014;the piece is a re-enactment of &#x201C;Imponderabilia,&#x201D; which Abramovic first performed in the 1970s. Today her nude army is being subjected to all the city&apos;s pervs, however. Will Rawls told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140414031215/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/arts/design/16public.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> that upon walking through, one man &quot;proceeded to slide his hand onto my ribs and back and then touched my butt. As he was passing me he looked me in the eyes and said &#x2018;You feel good, man.&#x2019; &#x201D; Rawls stayed at his station, but told a nearby security guard about the incident. Later he found out his admirer had his 30-year membership revoked, and was barred from ever returning to the museum!</p>

<p>The museum issued a statement saying that &#x201C;any visitor who improperly touches or disturbs&#x201D; a performer will be removed. But what if they&apos;re just... excited? Rawls also noted that there have been countless times he felt an erection graze across his hand. But even after all that, most performers in his position walk away feeling exhilarated by their shifts&#x2014;which are now just a short 75 minutes due to &quot;several fainting episodes.&quot;</p>
