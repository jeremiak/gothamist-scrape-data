<p>This morning Redditor Talwin posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021556/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1e2fqg/wtc_tower_1_completed_spire_viewed_from_tower_4/">a photo that made our feet sweat</a>, showing 1WTC (with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021556/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/photos_1_world_trade_center_spire_i.php">complete spire</a> in place) from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021556/http://www.wtc.com/about/office-tower-4">4 World Trade Center</a>. We contacted the poster who took the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021556/http://gothamist.com/tags/vertigo">vertigo-inducing</a> photo, and he&apos;s an ornamental iron worker for Local Union 580, &quot;part of the crew hanging glass on Tower 4.&quot; So it&apos;s probably good he isn&apos;t afraid of heights&#x2014;he told us, &quot;I don&apos;t get vertigo... I&apos;m abnormally comfortable with heights. I&apos;m always in a harness though, so that&apos;s kind of cheating.&quot;</p>
