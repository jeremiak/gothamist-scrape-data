Just as the Marine Mammal Stranding Center was losing hope, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128094947/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/manatee.php">Ilya the manatee</a> has been rescued! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128094947/http://www.1010wins.com/Wayward-Manatee-Found-in-Linden-Bound-for-FL/5552050">1010Wins</a> reports he is currently &quot;headed back to Florida aboard a transport jet after being rescued from murky waters near a New Jersey oil refinery.&quot;</p>

<p>Ilya was found on Monday and has been recuperating since &#x2014; it was kept a secret until now so that the media wouldn&apos;t create a stressful frenzy for him! This morning he got on board his flight at Atlantic City International Airport this morning, and is reportedly headed for &quot;an undisclosed military base Thursday morning.&quot; Top secret manatee mission!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160128094947/http://videos.nj.com/star-ledger/2009/10/wayward_manatee_rescued_in_nj.html">Star-Ledger</a> has some video of the rescue, and hopefully Ilya is enjoying the warmer climate in Florida right now.</p>
