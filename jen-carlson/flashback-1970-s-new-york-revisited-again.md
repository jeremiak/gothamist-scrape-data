</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ve looked back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811190650/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/27/70s.php">at 1970s New York</a> before &#x2014; but that decade sure did produce amazing photos, including some of these newly resurfaced ones (many recently posted in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811190650/http://wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?p=261719">Wired NY forum</a>). Many corners of the decade are documented: from Women&apos;s Lib to Miller High Life-fueled gatherings to shredding apart Yankee Stadium in 1973.</p>

<p>Do you have old New York photos you want to share? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811190650/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">Email them to us</a> and include the year and location if possible.</p>
