										<p>It makes sense that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116023932/http://gothamist.com/tags/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a> had a show on MTV during the station&apos;s early years... but we&apos;ve never heard of it until now! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116023932/http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-6675.cfm">Fimoculous</a> did some digging and found a few clips, circa 1987, from his program, which was called &quot;15 Minutes.&quot; Guests included Frank Zappa, Kevin Killon, Debbie Harry, Pee-wee Herman, John Waters, William Burroughs, and even a young Courtney Love. It&apos;s not all star power, though &#x2014; there&apos;s even a piece by Risa Dickstein about the world of Manhattan&apos;s mounted police.</p>

This was just one of Andy&apos;s shows, however &#x2014; he also hosted Andy Warhol&apos;s Fashion and Andy Warhol&apos;s TV, both cable access programs.</p>
