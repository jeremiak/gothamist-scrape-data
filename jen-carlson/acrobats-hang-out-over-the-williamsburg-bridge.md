<p>Earlier today we received a cryptic email alerting us to something called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064335/http://www.circusnyc.com/items/Risk_Life_for_Flight_FREE_July_11">Risk Life for Flight</a>&quot; happening during rush hour on the Williamsburg Bridge. The alert was mysterious, saying: &quot;For anyone inspired by Philippe Petite there will be a stupid, illegal, and probably beautiful aerial stunt happening on the Brooklyn side of the Williamsburg Bridge tonight.&quot; We&apos;ve got a staffer over there now documenting the crazy scene, and will have a full post tomorrow&#x2014;but for now, did you witness an acrobat hanging over the bridge on your way home? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064335/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">Send in</a> your accounts and photos. According to people on the scene, acrobats have been swinging on ribbons sans safety nets or harnesses, and cops are currently flooding the bridge.</p>
