<p>This year&apos;s Sexiest Vegetarians have been declared by PETA, with both &quot;celebrity&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172610/http://features.peta.org/sexy-veg-2011/Winners.aspx">vegetarian next door</a>&quot; winners. The big names this year are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172610/http://features.peta.org/sexiest-Vegetarian-Celebrities-2011/Winners.aspx">Russell Brand and Kristen Wiig</a>, who are taking over the spots from last year&apos;s winners: Bob Harper (<em>The Biggest Loser</em> trainer) and Olivia Wilde. </p>

<p>The animal rights organization notes that the two &quot;have captured the hearts of many with their comedic charm and compassionate choices.&quot;  Wiig keeps to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172610/http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/kristen-wiig-interview">a strict diet</a>, eating mostly tofu, soy, and cranberry juice (though allows one day a week to indulge in chocolate treats and &quot;hot, melted cheesy sandwiches&quot;). Brand has been a vegetarian since the age of 14! And told PETA, &quot;You shouldn&apos;t eat animals, it&apos;s mean to them.&quot;</p>
