Since Mayor de Blasio isn&apos;t cracking down on upstairs neighbors who stomp around too much, we are left to the passive aggressive note approach... or, whatever, having civilized conversations. (At least we don&apos;t have to deal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230193238/http://distractify.com/fun/pranks/letters-between-australian-troll-and-neighbor-over-floodlight/">with flood lights</a>?) The latest, which is actually kind of polite, aims to remind a neighbor in a <em>different building</em> that voices carry in our city&#x2014;a classic lesson in Urban Etiquette. It was found on East 1st Street by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230193238/http://evgrieve.com/2014/02/excellent-urban-etiquette-sign-name.html">EV Grieve</a>, and reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Hey, I love Russell Brand, too. But if I can hear his voice coming from the stereo in your apartment&#x2014;which isn&apos;t even in the same building as mine&#x2014;even with my windows closed, it means one of three things: 

<p>a) You&apos;re playing your stereo too loud,<br>
b) You need to shut your windows, or<br>
c) You need to turn down your stereo AND shut your windows</p>

<p>This is barely tolerable when you&apos;re blasting Russell Brand. But it&apos;s much, much worse when you&apos;re laying saccharine pop ballads at top volume, or perhaps having a little sing-a-long to your favorite Adele song. </p>

<p>The enclosed space between our buildings amplifies even the quietest sounds, which is why we can hear Nicolas splashing around in his hot tub at 3 a.m., notwithstanding the filthy tarp he optimistically erected as a sound barrier (he&apos;s ot good with the general principles of sound, apparently.)</p>

<p>So, do us all a favor, and remember that, even downtown, voices carry*. And how. </p>

<p>*This is a reference to the lyric from a 1980s Top 40 hit by &apos;Til Tuesday. If you like, I can blast it out my window repeatedly to help familiarize you with it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Are YOU a neighbor? Please be aware of how loud you&apos;re being, and maybe take it down a notch? Together, we can abolish unnecessary noise! And about that song... we&apos;ll include that video here, since it&apos;s amazing and confusing and that guy is really creepy and it features some NYC shots. Just don&apos;t listen to it too loudly, or better yet: wear headphones.</p>
