The event was set to begin at 7pm, and for hours prior to that (even after doors opened at 5:30) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=27&amp;id=15008">crowds filled the streets</a> around the hotel - many waiting to get a glimpse of the candidate and many just waiting to get in! It turns out the event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glynnis-macnicol/generation-nobama-wildly_b_61527.html">was oversold</a>, a reader tells us a volunteer came out and said, &quot;Well, you know, some folks brought their grandmothers or girlfriends along, and then the Marriott changed the size of the stage so we just couldn&apos;t handle all the folks with tickets.  Sorry.  Give us your name and a contact number and we&apos;ll get back to you.&quot; Tickets for the &#x201C;Official Brooklyn for Barack Kick-Off&#x201D; were only $25, a far cry from the $1000 pricetag on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/29/30_29obamamania.html">the July 24th event</a> held at the Brooklyn Heights home of Nina Collins. </p>

<p>With a lot of support in Brooklyn, the right-leaning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YWU1NTQzNGZjN2ZkMzcxMDgzZGNmMTc3ZWUzMWJhMmU=">National Review</a> asks if people are just too caught up in his charisma to really listen to what he&apos;s saying.</p><blockquote>For instance, take Obama&#x2019;s remarks on energy: &#x201C;People are fed up with the lack of energy strategy in this country. Why is it that we&#x2019;re paying three bucks at the gas tank?&#x201D; First of all, who&#x2019;s he talking to? Less than half of New York City residents own cars. Second, making cars more expensive to drive happens to be all the rage in this city right now.</blockquote> <img alt="2007_08_obama.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_08_obama.jpg" width="180" height="240" class="left"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/2007/08/23/2007-08-23_he_wants_army_of_bams.html">The Daily News</a> says, &quot;Obama was otherwise self-effacing as he looked to connect with the New York crowd by recalling his days living in a Park Slope apartment when he attended Columbia University and for some time afterward.&quot; He joked about not being able to afford to live there now...but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.flickr.com/photos/forklift/514164857">the Park Slope babies have his back</a> anyway. From the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/in-brooklyn-cheers-for-obama/">enthusiasm being reported</a> today, it seems he connected with the Brooklynites just fine, gas price talk aside. And when asked why voters should vote him over Hillary, he replied, &quot;We can pull the country together.&quot; More on last night&apos;s event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.audacityofparkslope.org/">here</a>, did anyone go and not get in?<p></p>

<p>Obama also stopped by The Daily Show and gave John Stewart and viewers 11 full minutes of his time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://twitter.com/BarackObama">He Twittered</a> earlier yesterday saying he was on his way there, but hasn&apos;t updated since. The Daily Show has been talking to a few Presidential candidates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20136286/">as part of their Indecision &apos;08 coverage</a>. Watch the video of Obama/Stewart (has a nice ring to it) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153353/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAvgtdmuYf0">here</a>. </p>
