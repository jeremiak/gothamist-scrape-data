The event, which takes place on Governors Island, has grown over the years, and is incredibly well organized as a result. While Saturday&apos;s event is already sold out, you can get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409162347/https://www.eventsprout.com/register/jazz_age_lawn_party__august_16">tickets for Sunday here</a>&#x2014;they range in price from $35 to $900, but currently only $55, $550, and $900 options are left. </p>

<p>On an extra tight budget? Really want to go Saturday instead of Sunday? No one can stop you from just taking the ferry to Governors Island and setting up your own picnic just outside the action. You&apos;ll only be separated by a short wooden fence, so you&apos;ll still hear the music, see the dancing, and basically be a part of it all... and you will have more space and shade.</p>

<p>Whether you purchase a ticket or just drop by to take in the scene from the outside, in order to get the most out of it you&apos;re going to want to dress up. This isn&apos;t mandatory, but as someone who has attended in modern day clothes... it is recommended that you bring even the tiniest bit of 1920s flair. Click through for a look at last year&apos;s look, and here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409162347/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/photos_jazz_age_lawn_party.php">our tips from last year</a> (note that ticket prices have changed slightly since then).<br>
