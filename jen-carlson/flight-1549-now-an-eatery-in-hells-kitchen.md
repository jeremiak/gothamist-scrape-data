<p>An eagle-eyed reader noticed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331213838/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=US+Airways+Flight+1549&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=US+Airways+Flight+1549&amp;ll=40.759261,-73.994315&amp;spn=0.004218,0.008883&amp;t=h&amp;z=17">Google Maps</a> has placed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331213838/http://gothamist.com/tags/flight1549">US Airways Flight 1549</a> at West 42nd Street and 10th Avenue. Not only is Google&apos;s version of Sullenberger&apos;s landing a much more tragic one, blocks from the real watery landing spot in the Hudson... it&apos;s also listed as an eatery!</p>
