<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082735/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/30/shepard_fairey_spotted_not_putting.php">we posted a photo</a> of Shepard Fairey &quot;coaching&quot; someone to put his new piece up, an image that came just weeks after the street artist was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082735/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/14/shepard_faireys_wife_sells_him_out.php">outed by his wife</a> for no longer putting his own pieces up. But now photographic evidence of Mr. Fairey has been sent in to us of showing that he did, in fact, get his hands dirty. <em>So we apologize okay!</em> Our new tipster tells us: &quot;While he had a support team, he physically applied the murals for over 4 hours with no attention.&quot; They also noted that he talked of his &quot;disdain for bank de-regulation&quot;&#x2014;multitasking!</p>
