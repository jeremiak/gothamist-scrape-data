<p>Bloomberg addressed those at the meeting, saying, &quot;We&apos;ll look into the feasibility of using the city&apos;s old trolley tracks to create new streetcar service in growing waterfront neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn, starting in Red Hook.&quot; A trolley can hold twice the amount of people a bus can, and has zero emissions. The Brooklyn Historic Railway Association&apos;s president Bob Diamond noted other perks of bringing such a service back, saying &quot;A light rail or a streetcar line usually costs about one-twentieth of what a subway line would cost. And they&apos;re outside, and they use existing streets, so there&apos;s no right-of-way acquisition and the track can be built very quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>Later this year the Department of Transportation will conduct a study looking at the feasibility of such a project in Red Hook. For now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024038/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/13/trolleys.php">take a look</a> at an old trolley zooming through Brooklyn in 1938!</p>
