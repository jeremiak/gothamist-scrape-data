So what&apos;s the ultimate gift this year? If you missed out on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175310/http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-egg1128,0,4286209.story">$18.5M Faberge egg</a>, how about the Norman Rockwell painting of Santa Claus?</p>

<p>The painting, titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175310/http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lfsearch_coa/LotDescription.aspx?intObjectId=5001313">Extra Good Boys and Girls</a>, is expected to take in between $2.5 and $3.5 million, according to Christie&apos;s New York, who told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175310/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11282007/news/regionalnews/rockwell_post_christmas_ale_917713.htm">NY Post</a>, &quot;This is our high-end Christmas present for this season.&quot;</p><blockquote>The oil-on-canvas piece, used for a December 1939 Saturday Evening Post magazine cover, is part of an auction featuring more than 215 lots of American works of art.<p></p>

<p>Christie&apos;s believes that it has gathered the most valuable selection of American art for one auction and estimates that the final tally could hit more than $60 million.</p></blockquote>The auction, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175310/http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lfsearch_coa/SearchResults.aspx?intSaleID=21397">Important American Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture</a>, is tomorrow at Christie&apos;s...but you would have to know someone who&apos;s been <em>really good</em> this year to drop that sort of change.<p></p>
