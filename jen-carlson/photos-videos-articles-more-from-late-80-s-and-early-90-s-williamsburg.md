While the level of talent is not as high as in Manhattan, that is not always the point. Brooklyn clubs, if one can make generalizations at all, are good places for novice musicians and artists to learn about stagecraft, to experiment without the fear of failing in front of high-paying audiences. Brooklyn offers surprisesâthe chance of coming across a group or a musician who is enormously proficient, but not yet known. And at cheaper prices, and in a more relaxed atmosphere.\"", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_6'] = photo;</script>

</div></div>					<p>Do you guys miss the old days of Williamsburg, like before The Edge and $5 pour-over coffees? And we&apos;re not talking that one time you went to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010220/http://www.vice.com/read/kokies-v15n1">Kokie&apos;s bar</a> in 2001 to score some snow, we&apos;re talking the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, when shit was <em>real</em>. Click through for a look back at the gentrifiers <em>before</em> the gentrifiers, or at least before the commercialized PBR/American Apparel-brand hipsters, and like, <em>way</em> before the yupsters moved in with their bohemian-chic lifestyle and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010220/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/williamsburg_condo_the_edge_opens_b.php">rock n&apos; roll playgrounds</a>.</p>

<p>These photos are from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010220/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150091577597362.267754.655962361&amp;type%3B=3&amp;l%3B=f07ee18277">this Facebook album</a>, where the compiler notes, &quot;Williamsburg was transformed in the early 90s from an artist colony to an urban subculture in its own right. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010220/https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=501003277687">Immersionism</a> received influence and collaboration from spaces in lower Manhattan that had been doing work in this direction since the late 70s, including Gargoyle Mechanique, Generator, Gas Station, Collective Unconscious, and others.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;ll see fliers for shows (King Missile seemed to enjoy playing there); articles on the emerging scene in the neighborhood&#x2014;including one on Lalalandia on Grand Street which offered up a late night dining experience (video below); and photos of parties on the Williamsburg Waterfront, before the Open Space Alliance or JellyNYC even existed.</p>
