<p>This enthusiastic fan was in the stands at Barclays Center on Monday night watching the Nets play the 76ers, and if you watch closely you&apos;ll witness the enthusiasm drained straight out of him as his face loses its hopeful cheer and transforms into a vessel of anger, a representation of Hope Lost, and... wait is that Famous Beatle Paul McCartney getting legitimately upset about losing a t-shirt shot from a t-shirt gun? Let&apos;s go to the videotape:</p>
