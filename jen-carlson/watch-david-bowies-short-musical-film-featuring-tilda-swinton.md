<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071404/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidbowie">David Bowie</a> turned 66 last month, and celebrated by coming slightly out of his self-imposed hiding. The Thin White Duke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071404/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/08/bowie.php">announced</a> his first studio album in a decade, <em>The Next Day</em>, which will be released on March 12th of this year. He&apos;s already released a video for the sentimental single &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot;... and now he&apos;s let loose another for &quot;Stars (Are Always Out).&quot; This latest video is a kind of epic short musical film featuring Tilda Swinton, and puts a very domestic Bowie opposite what seems like a younger version of himself, with nods to a glamorized and demented celebrity culture. Before you click play, you should know this video isn&apos;t entirely SFW.</p>

<p>And as for whether or not we&apos;ll see this show go on the road, the latest comes from Bowie&apos;s guitarist Gerry Leonard, who says there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071404/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/david-bowie-guitarist-gerry-leonard-odds-of-a-tour-are-50-50-20130220">a 50-50 chance</a> he&apos;ll tour.</p>
