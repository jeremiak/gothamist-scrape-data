This ad for Pakistan Airlines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152411/http://shortcuts.nerdcore.de/?p=124">is real</a>. And in the history of advertising, it really takes the creepy cake. Even worse than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152411/http://www.2spare.com/item_92595.aspx">babies endorsing cigarettes</a>! Seriously, if Nostradamus ran an ad firm to warn the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152411/http://11sep.info/">about</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152411/http://www.counterpunch.org/brzezinski.html">blowback</a>, this would have been in his portfolio. 

</p><p>It appeared in the March 19th, 1979 issue of Le Point (and surely countless other publications). Yes, the shadow is in pretty much in the same place as where the planes hit on September 11th, and there&apos;s no way the shadow should be that big unless it&apos;s seconds away from hitting the towers...but we don&apos;t think this should evoke any conspiracy theories. Right? [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152411/http://www.2spare.com/item_92595.aspx">2Spare.com</a>]</p>
