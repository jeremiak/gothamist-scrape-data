<p>Today is &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306235607/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)">Blue Monday</a>,&quot; which was invented back in 2005 as part of a marketing campaign for a travel company, by psychologist Cliff Arnall. At the time, he declared the third Monday in January to be the most depressing day of the entire year. Why? Well there&apos;s the freezing cold temperatures, your failed New Year&apos;s resolutions, your post-holiday debt, and basically everything is just terrible. He&apos;s explained in the past that the &quot;low&quot; is also caused by a drop in your motivation and &quot;the hibernation effect&quot;&#x2014;in other words, we&apos;re eating and sleeping more, and basically just feeling lethargic.</p>

<p>Other experts have called Arnall&apos;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; theory &quot;stupid,&quot; and he has even since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306235607/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jan/16/blue-monday-depressing-day-pseudoscience">called it</a> &quot;meaningless.&quot; But we can say that 3 out of 5 Gothamist staffers have a touch of the blues today, so we&apos;re believers! Though... one is unsure if it&apos;s residual food poisoning from the weekend, and another may just miss her new cat who is currently all alone in her apartment :( </p>
