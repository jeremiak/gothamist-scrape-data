The MTV News anchor has been a staple at the network--delivering up-to-the-minute music news, interviewing every bold-faced name in the book, and even helping to bring politics into the mix (Choose or Lose, anyone?). Being one of the only familiar faces left there, rumors of his lay-off from MTV served as another death rattle for the network, maybe even the final nail in the coffin. Norris has continued to keep up with the music scene, and has often been spotted at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213458/http://www.flickr.com/photos/subcow/2709304124/">McCarren Pool</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213458/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/07/todd_patrick_co.php">Todd P</a> shows, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213458/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590819/20080714/titus_andronicus.jhtml">talking to the up-and-comers</a> of a new generation of music. This week he told us a little bit about what his life has been like up to now.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved with MTV?</strong> An internship while I was at NYU turned into a writing job at MTV News. Judy McGrath was an early champion of mine and I thank her to this day for it. I worked as a writer in the news department, and not on camera, for several years before they offered me a gig as Kurt Loder&apos;s &apos;alternate&apos;.  </p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s your most memorable experience from working there?</strong> That&apos;s incredibly tough to say. Half a lifetime of great experiences. I often tell people that the single most memorable concert experience was one of my earliest big trips - the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium in London. Just amazing. And all of the MTV &apos;pro-social&apos; initiatives over the years - campaigns against gun violence and to promote diversity and sexual health - I was proud to be a part of.   </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything that didn&apos;t air that you wish did?</strong> Back when we used to have hourly news breaks and shot the news down in the studio every evening, they would roll tape on everything - in between segment banter, bitching, you name it. Surely some of that exists somewhere. It would be wildly entertaining.  </p>

<p><strong>What was a regular day like for you at MTV News?</strong> Writing, editing scripts, field shoots, lots of interviews, lots of voice overs, and more recently, writing for the MTV Newsroom blog.  This past year I also have had a more indie-oriented interview series on Rhapsody, in conjunction with MTV News.</p>
