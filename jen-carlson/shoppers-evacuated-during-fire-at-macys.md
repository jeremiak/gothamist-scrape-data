<p>About an hour ago an alert came over the newswire that there was a fire at Macy&apos;s in Herald Square, which noted it was &quot;2nd alarm due to the amount of people in the shop.&quot; One holiday shopper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141449/http://twitter.com/Iamcorporate/statuses/6872364527">Twittered</a> amidst the action, saying, &quot;I come all the way down here and Macy&apos;s is on fire... no lie, shit is flaming.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141449/http://ny1.com/content/110762/story">NY1</a> reports that shoppers were evacuated, and the fire was on an escalator between the third and fourth floors. The fire has now been extinguished and no injuries have been reported.</p>
