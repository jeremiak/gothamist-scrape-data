If they liked it so much why didn&apos;t they just put a ring on it! (Sorry.) They <em>were</em> so pleased with the service and food, however, that they dropped a $500 tip. That&apos;s over 40%! The News calls out another Nello&apos;s diner, a Russian billionaire, for being relatively stingy with a 15% tip of $7,328 tip on a $47,221.09 lunch.</p>
