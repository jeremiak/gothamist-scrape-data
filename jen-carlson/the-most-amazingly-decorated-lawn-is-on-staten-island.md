<p>Something special is going on at 724 Todt Hill Road on Staten Island, even if the neighbors aren&apos;t particularly happy about it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131214125052/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=4472">Scouting NY</a> hopped the ferry and got some shots of this lawn ornament job that would put many Roadside Attractions to shame. The work is that of homeowners Walter and Alla Shchegol, who have been at it since 2006. A comment thread on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131214125052/http://www.silive.com/eastshore/index.ssf/2010/06/whimsy_by_the_wayside_on_state.html">SILive.com</a> shows that neighbors despise the statue-saturated space, calling it a roadside <em>distraction</em>. But at least it isn&apos;t dolls? <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131214125052/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/video_inside_the_home_of_staten_isl.php">It could always be dolls</a>!</em></p>
