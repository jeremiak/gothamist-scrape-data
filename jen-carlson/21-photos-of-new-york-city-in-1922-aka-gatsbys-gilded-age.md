</div></div>					<p>Earlier today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200317/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/the_great_gatsby_trailer_is_here.php">we looked at the trailer for Baz Luhrman&apos;s <em>Great Gatsby</em></a>, which features a very vibrant-looking New York City during the year 1922. Now you can click through and see what New York <em>really</em> looked like during that year (but wait, it&apos;s better if you first press play on the below song). And here&apos;s what was happening in the five boroughs:</p><ul><li>It was just a couple of years into the Prohibition Era, and New York City&apos;s speakeasy clubs were multiplying&#x2014;in fact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200317/http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/volstead-act/">by 1925</a> there &quot;were anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 speakeasy clubs&quot; here.<br>
</li><li>On the field, Babe Ruth had just signed a 3 year contract at $52,000/year with the New York Yankees. (It also had him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200317/http://sports.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=707&amp;lotNo=19090">promising</a> to &quot;go easier on drinking.&quot;)<br>
</li><li>On the stage, Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Hairy Ape&quot; had just premiered&#x2014;the play was about &quot;a brutish, unthinking laborer known as Yank, as he searches for a sense of belonging in a world controlled by the rich.&quot;<br>
</li><li>In the zoos, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200317/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/19/flashback_6.php">the 1st duck-billed platypus</a> was publicly exhibited in the U.S., at the Bronx Zoo.<br>
</li><li>The Coney Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200317/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_J._Riegelmann">boardwalk</a> was under construction, known as &quot;Coney Island&apos;s Fifth Avenue,&quot; and opened the following year on May 15th.<br>
</li><li>And on the radio, Al Jolson had a popular song called &quot;April Showers.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
