Marina Maiuri stood atop the Empire State Building (which is <em>so</em> &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;) to have her photo snapped by the paper on the observation deck; but she wasn&apos;t looking for love, she was looking to propose. </p>

<p>The photo and article ran this morning, titled &quot;Hey, Sean: Will you marry me?&quot; Sean is her boyfriend of 18 months, and Marina &quot;wouldn&apos;t trade him for anyone - not even George Clooney!&quot; (That&apos;s what she says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180120/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/27/wife_of_nypd_co.php"><em>now</em></a>.) How did the two lovebirds meet? Sean bought her a cosmopolitan at an Upper East Side bar and the two presumably hit it off right away. Here comes the Leap Year twist:</p><blockquote>Her unconventional proposal is part of an ancient custom that dates to fifth-century Ireland, when the Emerald Isle&apos;s patron saint, St. Patrick, decreed that lovelorn women could seize the initiative on a Leap Year.<p></p>

<p>The concept was made famous by the 1930s &quot;Li&apos;l Abner&quot; comic strip when a spinster named Sadie Hawkins chased and &quot;caught&quot; an eligible bachelor and marched him down the aisle.</p></blockquote>Well, her proposal worked, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180120/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/02/29/2008-02-29_gal_who_proposed_in_daily_news_gets_a_bi.html">the paper updated the story</a> this morning reporting that the two-some are officially engaged! Like all good <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180120/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/09/best_of_luck_to.php">love stories</a>, this one ended up on morning television; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180120/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22425001/vp/23405516#23405516">watch here</a>.<p></p>
