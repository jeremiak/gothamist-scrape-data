</div></div>					<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013036/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/jet_blue_flight_attendant_activates.php">a JetBlue flight attendant</a>, Steven Slater, made a dramatic departure from his job after a passenger on his flight refused to follow the rules. The meltdown occurred when Slater told a passenger not to remove bags from the overhead compartment until the plane was stopped. When his request was ignored, the 39-year-old Slater took to the intercom and declared: &quot;<strong>To the fucking asshole that told me to fuck off, it&apos;s been a good 28 years!</strong>&quot; He then grabbed a couple of beers, activated the emergency chute, grabbed his bags, and slid to his freedom. </p>

<p>Well, <em>almost</em>. Shortly after the Port Authority police busted him at his home in Queens (where he was already resting easy in bed with his boyfriend), but even the <em>50 cops that showed up</em> couldn&apos;t kill his buzz from (those beers and) quitting his post at Jet Blue&#x2014;plenty of photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013036/http://abcnews.go.com/US/jetblue-flight-attendant-steven-slater-arrested-flight-jfk/story?id=11361298">and video</a> show him smiling while in custody.  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013036/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/jetblue_natic_SdcailLAMLPJFNTfsVj8BM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">allegedly told investigators</a> that he took his personal belongings from the plane, too, &quot;Oh, yes. I threw the bags onto the chute. Then I slid down after them.&quot;</p>

<p>Slater has been charged with criminal mischief and reckless endangerment. Passenger Phil Catelinet told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013036/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38629517/ns/travel-news/">TODAY</a> show that Slater &quot;was smiling&#x2014;he was happy he had done this. He was happy he was done with his job at JetBlue.&quot; Slater is HIV positive, and also a recovering alcoholic who previously battled substance abuse problems. A couple of years ago he wrote on his MySpace page, &quot;I am enjoying being back in the skies. Beating alcoholism and substance abuse one day at a time.&quot; As if that weren&apos;t enough, Slater is also dealing with his mother dying of lung cancer; neighbors told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013036/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/08/09/2010-08-09_talk_about_turbulance_jetblue_flight_attendant_drops_intercom_fbomb_bolts_down_e.html?loc=interstitialskip">the Daily News</a> &quot;the prognosis is not good.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013036/http://www.tmz.com/2010/08/10/steven-slater-jet-blue-flight-attendant-overhead-bin-criminal-charges-slide/">TMZ</a> has the scoop from the family&apos;s end, saying &quot;Slater told his mom he tried shutting the bin, when [the passenger] &apos;maliciously&apos; pulled the bin down, striking Steven in the head.&quot; Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013036/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/nyregion/10attendant.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> talked to those peripherally in Slater&apos;s life, who overwhelmingly called him a &quot;very conscientious, responsible individual.&#x201D;</p>
