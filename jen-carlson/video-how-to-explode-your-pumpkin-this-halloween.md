<p>We&apos;ve suffered through centuries of boring, stationary jack-o-lanterns. But no longer. Grant Thompson has shared a video tutorial showing anyone with an internet connection how to create an exploding pumpkin face&#x2014;all you need is a pumpkin, a knife, and some &#x201C;very flammable gas (acetylene)&#x201D;! Sounds perfectly safe:</p>

<p>If you don&apos;t want to blow your hand off or start a fire, then we recommend you <strike>grow a pair</strike> use some hard thin wire to stick into your pumpkin, with chunks of pumpkin on the other end, to give the <em>illusion</em> of an exploding pumpkin. Or whatever, get your chemistry set out and just see what happens:</p>

<p>The alternative is letting it sit there, and rot, and the raccoons will get it... you know how this ends. This Halloween, blow up your decorative gourds, m*therf*cker.
