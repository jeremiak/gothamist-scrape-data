</div></div>					<p>Ever get that feeling you were born in the wrong era... at least, architecturally? Here&apos;s a look at 156 Canal Street circa 1910-1915, when it was the White House Hotel. According to the Library of Congress this is where &quot;John F. Schrank lived before his attempted assassination of U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt in 1912.&quot; (More photos of Schrank&apos;s arrest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208102705/http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/johnschrank/">here</a>). Since that time, as you can see, the building has been stripped of its gorgeous facade, and an HSBC bank has set up shop next door. Paging Doc Brown, we&apos;re gonna need that DeLorean asap.</p>
