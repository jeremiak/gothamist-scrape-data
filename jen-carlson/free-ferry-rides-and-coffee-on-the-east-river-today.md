<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152414/http://gothamist.com/tags/eastriverferry">East River Ferry</a> is celebrating six months of service, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152414/https://twitter.com/#!/eastriverferry/status/147324483961761792">has announced</a> that you can climb aboard their vessels for free today, all day, and they&apos;ll even be giving you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152414/http://www.nywaterway.com/AdvisoryDetails.aspx?aid=183">free coffee</a> from Brooklyn Roasting Company this morning. Even if the ferry came in last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152414/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/15/ferry_vs_bike_vs_subway_a_commuter.php#photo-5">in our commuter race</a> (by a half hour!), it <em>is</em> the most scenic way to get to where you&apos;re going. Plus, even though it may rain a little today, it&apos;s going to be a downright balmy 53 degrees!</p>
