title: Trader Joe's Coming To Brooklyn, For Real This Time

										<p><img alt="2007_06_arts_tjs.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193056im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_06_arts_tjs.jpg" width="350" height="250" class="left">Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193056/http://www.nysun.com/article/56076?page_no=4">The Sun</a> reported that AvalonBay Communities would &quot;begin construction this summer on a 42-story, residential market-rate tower with approximately 600 units. The property will have ground floor retail, which could house the borough&apos;s first Trader Joe&apos;s market.&quot; And even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193056/http://racked.com/archives/2007/04/30/brooklyn_to_get_its_own_trader.php"><em>earlier</em> this year</a> it was suspected that TJ&apos;s would move into One Brooklyn Bridge Park. </p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193056/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=27&amp;id=13747">The Brooklyn Eagle</a> is reporting that Trader Joe&apos;s will soon be stocking the fridges of many Brooklynites as the store will be moving into the (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193056/http://www.dumbo-newyork.com/">Two Trees</a>-owned) former Independence Savings Bank building, at the corner of Court Street and Atlantic Avenue (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193056/http://mcbrooklyn.blogspot.com/2007/05/urban-outfitters-nixes-independence.html">sorry Urban Outfitters fans</a>).</p>

<p>While there&apos;s been no official announcement yet, it looks like this time it&apos;s really going to happen - a good thing for Brooklynites who have been suffering from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193056/http://foresthills72.blogspot.com/2007/05/tjs-envy.html">TJ&apos;s envy</a>. The store will be placed &quot;at the juncture of three affluent brownstone neighborhoods: Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill,&quot; and while the Eagle refers to it as &quot;an upscale supermarket,&quot; it&apos;s usually quite affordable (especially compared to Whole Foods). </p>

<p>The bank building was originally going to be converted to condos, with an apartment building built in the parking lot linked to the bank! The Eagle mentions that &quot;for a variety of reasons, a decision by the Landmarks Preservation Commission made it impossible for that link to be created.&quot; However, the new building in the lot will still be built...so looks like parking will be an issue, for those with a car.</p>
