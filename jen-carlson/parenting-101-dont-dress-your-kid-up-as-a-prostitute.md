<p>On a scale of reality television shows about toddler pageantry and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133001/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/15/virgin_bikini_waxing_now_popular_fo.php">&quot;virgin&quot; bikini waxes</a>, how bad is this? A mom on TLC&apos;s <em>Toddlers and Tiaras</em> dressed up her three year old child as Julia Roberts in <em>Pretty Woman</em>. And not just the cleaned-up, post-kissing on the mouth, being allowed to shop in the fancy store Julia Roberts in <em>Pretty Woman</em>, the toddler even wore her classic streetwalking garb. Unsurprisingly, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133001/http://www.parentstv.org/">Parents Television Council</a> is now railing against the show and the pageant mom, saying:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We have a serious problem when a network formerly known as The Learning Channel features a toddler, who probably hasn&apos;t even learned to read, dressed as a prostitute showing off her sexy strut. There&apos;s no question, TV executives are complicit in robbing these small kids of their childhood. For years we&apos;ve seen adult sexuality being inappropriately and aggressively foisted on innocent young children, but children today are being sexualized at younger and younger ages. All available data suggests they will suffer for it later in life.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The mother, Wendy Dickey, has spoken out as well, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133001/http://www.tmz.com/2011/09/07/toddlers-and-tiaras-mother-mom-wendy-dickey-daughter-child-baby-hooker-prostitute-outfit-julia-roberts-pretty-woman/">told TMZ</a> that &quot;no harm was done to my child&quot; by dressing her as a hooker, and the kid had no idea who she was portraying. (Just like last week&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133001/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/dolly-parton-the-4-year-old-version-on-toddlers-and-tiaras/2011/09/01/gIQARjy4uJ_blog.html">little Dolly Parton</a>, who was wearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133001/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/26/who_wouldnt_get_their_7-year-old_a.php">a padded bra</a>.) </p>

<p>She added that &quot;at least I&apos;m not forcing [her] into sports and getting my child injured like some parents.&quot; Right, thank goodness she&apos;s not being forced to do normal, healthy, childlike things.</p>
