</div></div>					<p>Steel wool, chicken wire, fire... urban exploration is being taken to the next level of extreme. Seems nowadays kids aren&apos;t content with merely trespassing and snapping some photos... now they&apos;re running through abandoned subway tracks twirling these homemade concoctions around while they burn. The result <em>is</em> pretty cool though. Here are a few photos by Pro-Zak, who calls the process &quot;burning,&quot; taken in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and even New Jersey.</p>
