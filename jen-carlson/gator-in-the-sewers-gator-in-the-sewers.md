										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="gatorqueens0810.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105652im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gatorqueens0810.jpg" width="350" height="284"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Elizabeth Ferguson via the Post</span></i></div> If you&apos;ve ever shrugged off the idea of gators in our sewers before, you might be interested in hearing about <em>this alligator that was just pulled from the sewer system in Queens</em>. Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105652/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/23/urban_legend_uncovered_sewer_alliga.php">the legend is real</a>.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105652/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/gator_crawls_out_of_queens_drain_weQXk9fnuE3vAbkAvxddJL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, an 18-inch gator crawled out of an overflowing storm drain in Astoria yesterday afternoon and quickly sought refuge underneath a car. This all happened on Newtown Avenue and 29th Street, where locals were heard screaming, &quot;Crocodile!&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105652/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/23/2010-08-23_reptile_dysfunction_as_croc_shocks_qns.html">The Daily News</a> points out that the difference between a croc and a gator is all in the snout.)</p>

<p>While the NYPD were quick to take cell phone pics of the creature, they weren&apos;t ready to declare it actually came from the sewer; a spokesman told the paper, &quot;It could have been dumped from a car or it could have come out of a sewer.&quot; The gator was taken by Animal Care &amp; Control, and will now be taken to a licensed rehabilitator or reptile sanctuary... but maybe he should be taken in for questioning first so we can find out about the colony of sewer gators he undoubtedly left behind.</p>
