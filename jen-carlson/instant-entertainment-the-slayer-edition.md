We were apprehensive at first but after many recommendations, a bout with a bad cold/plenty of time for TV, and a pre-existing undeniable appreciation for the work of Joss Whedon, we gave in.\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nThe series may include, at times, some pretty B-movie quality monsters, but it\'s all part of the fun—and the characters and dialogue are enough to make up for the sometimes plastic-masked goblins. And if the show doesn\'t grab you at first, it\'s worth sticking it out, having just watched \<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_%28Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer%29\"\>the famous \"Hush\" episode\<\/a\> this week, we can attest to the fact that this show gets better with each season (well, at least until season four, which is where we\'re at currently—no spoilers please!). Though be warned, Sarah Michelle Gellar\'s fighting skills on the show (she studied Tae Kwon Do, kickboxing, boxing, street fighting and gymnastics) might make you fantasize about roundhouse kicking some unsavory straphangers on your evening commutes.\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\n\<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-1v_q6TWAL4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\>\<\/iframe\>", "credit":""};

The s\cript was also written by Joss Whedon, and stars Kristy Swanson as the Slayer, and Luke Perry (Dylan!) as her romantic interest. This is definitely a more campy take on \<em\>Buffy\<\/em\> than the television show that came later, but who doesn\'t love campy horror flicks?
