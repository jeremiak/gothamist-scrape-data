<p>The Museum of the Moving Image is celebrating director and screenwriter Harmony Korine this month with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041939/http://www.movingimage.us/films/2013/03/08/detail/harmony-korine/">a series</a> that will screen nearly all of his films... but not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041939/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113540/">that 1995 one</a> that scarred you for life, brought out your inner nihilistic-teen disaffectedness, and introduced you to Chloe Sevigny. You will, however, have a chance to see <em>Gummo</em>, <em>Julien Donkey-Boy</em>, <em>Mister Lonely</em>, <em>Trash Humpers</em>, and (if you can get in) his upcoming <em>Spring Breakers</em>... all in this beautiful theater (which regrettably we could not include in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041939/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/the_best_movie_theaters_in_nyc.php">best <em>traditional</em> movie theaters</a> list):</p>

<p>This retrospective kicks off tomorrow, and includes all of Korine&apos;s directorial features and a preview screening of <em>Spring Breakers</em>, where Korine will be in attendance. We&apos;re told that screening is now sold out, but there <em>may</em> be tickets at the door the day of. Get in the mood by chugging some cough syrup:</p>
