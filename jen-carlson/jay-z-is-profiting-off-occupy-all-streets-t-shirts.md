<p>&quot;What better way to show your support for the Occupy Wall Street Movement than with a dope tee?&quot; That&apos;s what Jay-Z&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111192225/http://www.roc4life.com/profiles/blogs/sneak-peak-the-occupy-all-streets-tee">Rocawear company wants to know</a>. Certainly <em>we</em> can&apos;t think of any better way, so dope tee it is! Except, the hard-earned cash you spend on that tee will only help you plump up the pockets of one of the richest men on the planet: Jay-Z. The rapper/entrepreneur showed off his &quot;Occupy All Streets&quot; shirt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111192225/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/08/jay-z_reps_occupy_wall_street_befor.php">earlier this week</a>, posing in it for a pic with mogul and OWS supporter Russell Simmons, which instantly raised eyebrows over whether he was planning to mass produce and profit from the design (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111192225/http://slutwalkberlin.de/post/11692462352/women-deserve-to-occupy-w-all-street-s-without">isn&apos;t exactly original</a>).</p>

<p>Turns out Jay-Z is selling them through his Rocawear company starting today (though currently we can&apos;t find it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111192225/http://www.rocawear.com/productsearch/q/occupy/none/rank">on his site</a>), and a Rocawear rep confirmed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111192225/http://www.businessinsider.com/is-jay-z-trying-to-profit-from-occupy-wall-street-2011-11#ixzz1dPEKCiZj">Business Insider</a> that none of the proceeds will go to the OWS movement (also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111192225/http://www.businessinsider.com/online-store-rips-off-jay-shells-occupy-wall-street-signs-2011-10">not exactly an original idea</a>).</p><blockquote>&quot;The &apos;Occupy All Streets&apos; T shirt was created in support of the &apos;Occupy Wall Street&apos; movement. Rocawear strongly encourages all forms of constructive expression, whether it be artistic, political or social. &apos;Occupy All Streets&apos; is our way of reminding people that there is change to be made everywhere, not just on Wall Street. At this time we have not made an official commitment to monetarily support the movement.&quot;</blockquote>Will Uncle Rush, who touted Jay-Z for taking &quot;Occupy Wall Street to a whole new level&quot; with the shirt, still be promoting it? Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111192225/https://twitter.com/#!/UncleRUSH/status/134127652767412224">he did already buy one for himself</a>.<p></p>
