                            <p>Everyone is talking about Christina Aguilera messing up the lyrics to the national anthem at the Super Bowl last night. The video is below, where she belts out: &quot;Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, what so proudly we watched at the twilight&apos;s last gleaming.&quot; The correct lyrics are: &quot;Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O&apos;er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming.&quot; </p>

And, upside, at least the Black Eyed Peas didn&apos;t perform it?</p>
