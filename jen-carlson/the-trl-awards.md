They have signs declaring their love for someone we&apos;ve never heard of and their high pitched shrills are often heard below 14th. They are there because of MTV&apos;s TRL (Total Request Live), today&apos;s version of what we used to call the Top 5 at 5 (when we actually had to call in to place our vote, because there was no texting or online voting yet). </p>

<p>Well, tomorrow the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312195959/http://www.mtv.com/onair/dyn/trl-awards-2006/series.jhtml">4th Annual TRL Awards</a> are taking place...and guess who got invited? We&apos;ll be the one&apos;s wearing earplugs and asking Stephen from Laguna Beach some hard hitting questions. Want to know who else will be there?: Mariah Carey, Ashlee Simpson, Chris Brown, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Ne Yo and Amanda Bynes.</p>

<p>So make a sign for one of them and bring your outdoor voices so you can scream for the red carpet arrivals at 1:30pm. Seriously, we&apos;d like to see some people our own age out there. And by all means, let us know if you have any questions we should ask out on the red carpet...</p>
