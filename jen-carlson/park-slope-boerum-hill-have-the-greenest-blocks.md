title: Park Slope, Boerum Hill Have the Greenest Blocks
---

	
										<p>The Brooklyn Botanic Garden has picked through the weeds for the 14th time, to find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309185159/http://www.bbg.org/edu/greenbridge/greenestblock">The Greenest Blocks in Brooklyn</a>, and they announced the winners of the annual contest this morning.</p>

<p>In the end, it was Park Slope and Boerum Hill that came out on top, with first-place residential block going to 8th Street between Prospect Park West and 8th Avenue. How did they get to be so green? By hosting &#x201C;Mulch and Wine Night,&#x201D; which was &quot;dedicated to encouraging fund-raising for topsoil and mulch, and &apos;Stoopendous,&apos; a stoop sale and greening-education program to spread the word about the initiative and raise funds.&quot; As for the first-place commercial block, the title went to Bond Street between Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street.</p>

<p>The contest is borough-wide and acts as a gardening initiative throughout the year, as the BBG&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309185159/http://www.bbg.org/edu/greenbridge">GreenBridge</a> team &quot;offers programs and events to encourage borough residents to begin greening their blocks.&quot; They even sell window box kits, and this year the Best Window Box honor went to residents in Boerum Hill, Bed-Stuy and Prospect Park South. For <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309185159/http://www.bbg.org/edu/greenbridge/greenestblock/2008/winners_others.html">all of the winners</a>, see a full list after the jump--prizes ranged from gardening tools, to plants, to cold hard cash. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309185159/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/07/bedfordstuyvesa.php">Last year</a> Bed-Stuy and Boerum Hill took home the titles.</p>
