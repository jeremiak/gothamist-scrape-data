<p>Last weekend Yoko Ono celebrated the late John Lennon&apos;s birthday in SoHo, and it was a far cry from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151646/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/video_vintage_footage_shows_most_am.php">Lennon parties of the past</a>. At this one, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151646/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/06/yoko_ono_celebrates_john_lennon_in.php">Ono was selling &quot;the artwork of John Lennon&quot;</a> to benefit Citymeals-on-Wheels. And now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151646/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38845/oh-yoko-is-john-lennons-widow-duping-gullible-collectors-with-sham-drawings/">ArtInfo</a> is calling Ono out for selling counterfeit pieces, after collectors who paid thousands of dollars for prints are complaining they were sold &quot;cut and paste mash-ups.&quot;</p>

<p>Ono was selling pieces as &quot;lithographs, serigraphs, and copper etchings hand printed from the original drawings,&quot; but allegedly they were &quot;recomposed and colored by Ono... rather than Lennon prints.&quot; At least one man accused Ono of altering her late husband&apos;s work, telling AI, &quot;The so-called &apos;Artwork of John Lennon&apos; being offered for sale in SoHo this weekend was actually posthumously forged in color and new compositions, each part of bogus editions with counterfeit John Lennon chop mark/signatures.&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time Ono has been accused of altering Lennon&apos;s work. In 2010 she wanted to add color to one of his pieces, saying, &quot;at least let me color it because John probably would not have minded it if I did it.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151646/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/10/yoko-ono-is-selling-fake-john-lennon-art/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Animal</a>]</p>
