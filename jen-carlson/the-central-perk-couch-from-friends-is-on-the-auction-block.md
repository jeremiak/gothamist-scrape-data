<p>It&apos;s been eight years since the set went dark on <em>Friends</em>, but apparently people still care enough about the gang to spend absurd amounts of money on an old piece of furniture from the show. The couch that the cast often occupied at Central Perk coffee shop (because as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233109/http://www.tv.com/shows/friends/the-one-where-they-all-turn-thirty-17474/">young people</a> living in New York <em>they never went to bars</em>) is up on the auction block <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233109/http://www.dirt.com/%E2%80%98friends%E2%80%99-couch-up-for-auction/">this week</a> in Los Angeles, where the show was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233109/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/10/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_top_5_worst.php#photo-3">actually filmed</a>, and it&apos;s expected to take in around $6,000.
