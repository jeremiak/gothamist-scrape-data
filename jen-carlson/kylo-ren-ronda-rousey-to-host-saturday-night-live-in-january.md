<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164358/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> has just announced the first hosts of 2016, and both of them could kick any of y&apos;alls asses. On January 16th, there&apos;s former Marine Adam Driver, who plays Kylo Ren in <em>Star Wars</em> and Adam on <em>Girls</em> (returning for a 5th season next month). Maybe he&apos;ll bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164358/https://twitter.com/kylor3n">Emo Kylo Ren</a> to life in Studio 8H. </p>

<p>Then there&apos;s UFC champion, Olympic medalist, and total badass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164358/http://gothamist.com/tags/rondarousey">Ronda Rousey</a> hosting on January 23rd. She&apos;ll be joined by musical guest Selena Gomez, and Driver by Chris Stapleton. </p>
