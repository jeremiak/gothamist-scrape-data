Touring private schools for their French-speaking children, toting their kids off to auditions, getting away to the Hamptons and presumbably being &quot;fabulous&quot; at whatever else fills their social schedule.  </p>

<p>Last night one of the &quot;housewives,&quot; The Countess LuAnn, broke out of the bubble and headed downtown to live vicariously through her niece, who took her to Cake Shop after a dinner at Little Giant. After imbibing a few grapefruit margaritas at the restaurant she was woo-hooing in the front row for a local band (anyone know who they were? Surely they were thrilled with their BravoTV debut). </p>

<p>Perhaps the Countess wasn&apos;t as comfy as she seemed in the venue however, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623152148/http://williamsboard.com/topic/56796/&amp;r=24">Williamsboard</a> poster recounted the awkwardness: &quot;this made it to air? when i worked at cake shop, the &apos;countess&apos; came in all dolled up in ridiculous garb (some sort of red smokers jacket or kimono thing) with huge cameras and lights in tow to see a show. she reeked of perfumed and was obviously uncomfortable and out of place seeing an indie band in a dirty LES basement bar. we were all snickering.&quot;  </p>
