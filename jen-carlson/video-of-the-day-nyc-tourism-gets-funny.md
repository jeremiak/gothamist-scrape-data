<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025950/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/11/this_is_new_yor.php">Last year</a> Bloomberg announced the &quot;first-ever global multimedia communications campaign to promote New York City,&quot; with efforts to bring in more tourism through television, outdoor advertising, internet and everything in between.</p>

<p>The mayor is now getting some unsolicited help from some New York comedians. The troupe got together to film their own NYC Tourism ad, which includes a unique explanation of the city&apos;s homeless problem. Their version of our history explains that NYC was founded in 1974 &quot;by the friendly Walt Disney Corporation, so if you see any meth addicts or homeless people, don&apos;t worry folks, they&apos;re just animatronics.&quot;</p>
