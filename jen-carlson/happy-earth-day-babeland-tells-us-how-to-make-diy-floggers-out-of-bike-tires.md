										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bikeflogg0411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164721im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bikeflogg0411.jpg" width="365" height="221" class="image-left"> </span>Babeland of Brooklyn is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164721/http://www.babeland.com/events/">celebrating Earth Day</a> the only way they know how: the kinky way. Tonight they&apos;re hosting a lesson filled with &quot;eco-sexy tips&quot; and invite their &quot;crafty customers to make DIY floggers from recycled bicycle tubes donated by Ride Brooklyn.&quot; If you can&apos;t join them at 6 p.m., but are in need of a fast flogging fix, fear not... the shop&apos;s Pamela Doan tells us all you need is dowels, electrical tape (comes in lots of colors so you can make it pretty!), and recycled bike inner tubes. </p>

<p>You&apos;ll have to use your best judgment when it comes to the finer details, however, as Doan says her tutorial includes talking everyone through &quot;the different types of floggers and help them determine how to customize their flogger. For example, beginners should go with shorter, wider tails because it&#x2019;s easier to manage and makes a satisfying SMACK without stinging too much. It&#x2019;s bark is worse than it&#x2019;s bite, so to speak.&quot;</p>

<p>If a good flogging isn&apos;t what you need, there are plenty of other eco-friendly materials going into toys these days. Look for ones made from renewable resources, like glass, wood, and steel. For example: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164721/http://store.babeland.com/dildos-g-spot/fling-wood-butt-plug">The Fling</a> is made from sustainable, organic hardwoods, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164721/http://store.babeland.com/dildos-hard/laid-stone-dildo">The Laid Stone Dildo</a> is made from Norwegian Moonstone that uses the pieces of stone from the quarry that would be thrown away, otherwise. There are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164721/http://store.babeland.com/vibrators-bullet-eggs/solar-bullet-vibrator">solar-powered</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164721/http://store.babeland.com/vibrators-slimline/earth-angel-hand-crank-vibrator">hand-crank vibrators</a>! We&apos;ve come a long way since the steam-powered &#x201C;Manipulator&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164721/http://gizmodo.com/#!5466997/the-steam+powered-vibrator-and-other-terrifying-early-sex-machines-nsfw">of the 1870s</a>.</p>
