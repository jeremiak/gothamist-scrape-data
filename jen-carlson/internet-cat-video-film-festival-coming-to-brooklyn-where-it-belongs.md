										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="smallSAM0413.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smallSAM0413.jpg" width="350" height="329"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046/http://www.samhaseyebrows.com/">Sam Has Eyebrows</a> is from Brooklyn!</i></div> Last year the Internet Cat Video Film Festival held its inaugural fest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046/http://chicagoist.com/2012/07/12/the_cannes_of_cat_videos.php">in Minnesota</a>, but when it returns this year it will be in New York City (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046/http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2013/internet-cat-video-festival-2">in addition to Minnesota</a>), where the streets are lined with top shelf kitty litter and high paying cat food contract$. The organizers announced the addition of a Brooklyn festival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046/https://www.facebook.com/events/176617352488995/?fref=tck">online</a>, obviously:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;The #catvidfest became its own viral phenomenon, drawing a crowd of more than 10,000 fans to the Walker&apos;s Open Field. The event caught the attention of local, national, and international audiences and media and spawned &apos;copy-cat&apos; festivals and a touring program around the country. For its second edition, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046/http://www.walkerart.org/catvidfest">the Internet Cat Video Festival 2013</a> makes its NYC debut at Warsaw in Brooklyn. Bringing along the same spirit of community and collaboration, this year&apos;s showcase of feline hijinks includes music, special guests and more.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Will the &quot;special guests&quot; include already famous Cats of the Internet, like Grumpy Cat, who was recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/grumpy_cat_at_sxsw.php">dragged around on a press tour</a>? Only time will tell&#x2014;the festival isn&apos;t happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204046/https://www.facebook.com/events/176617352488995/?fref=tck">until October</a>, which means you have about six months to get a cat and make it viral unless you just want to be a lazy spectator (which would be very cat-like of you). If you&apos;re contemplating making a video, we have some tips: Try to include another animal species, a heartwarming song not unlike one you&apos;d hear as the credits roll at the end of a rom com, and get your cat to sleep belly-up for at least a few seconds.</p>

<p>Or you can go for cheap comedy:</p>
