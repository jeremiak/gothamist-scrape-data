Because it seems like that&apos;s what&apos;s happening? A transcript thus far: </p>

<ul><li>Sitting at JFK. Drinking in bar waiting to board for Chicago. Watching 2 euro guys picking up 2 ditsy American gals. Classic!
</li><li>Euro gents seem to be closing this deal. The brunette couldn&apos;t be more available. The blonde not giving as much. Off to the gate.
</li><li>Flight delayed. Hanging by gate Sitting next to one stanky character. I can&apos;t believe show [sic] bad this man smells.
</li><li>This is like being in a NYC cab in the late 80s.
</li><li>Had to move my seat. Heading back to the bar. See how the dudes and the young Americans made out.
</li><li>No sign of either dudes or their prospective targets at bar. Somebody needs to check the Motels on Rockaway Blvd</li></ul>
