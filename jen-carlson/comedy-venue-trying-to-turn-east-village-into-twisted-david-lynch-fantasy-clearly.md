										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="twinpeaksredcurtain0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154158im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/twinpeaksredcurtain0311.jpg" width="365" height="346" class="image-right"> </span>Earlier this month East Village locals rallied against the UCB Theater&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154158/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/hot_chicks_room.php">Hot Chicks Room</a>, a bar attached to their new comedy venue. The name was discarded, the sign was taken down, and the NIMBYs target heart rates went back to normal... until the red curtains came up. </p>

<p>Currently the comedy troupe has the curtains up in the front windows, facing the sidewalk, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154158/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110329/lower-east-side-east-village/comedy-clubs-red-curtains-latest-irritant-east-village#ixzz1I2BzYdNo">DNA Info</a> reports locals are outraged! Possibly fanning themselves and having spells! One of the distraught says, &quot;They look like red velvet, like you would see in a bordello.&quot; Another says the curtains make the joint look &quot;sleazy.&quot;</p>

<p>UCB&apos;s managing director, Alex Sidtis, emailed the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154158/http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=%22theatre+curtains%22&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1200&amp;bih=641">this link</a>, adding, &quot;This is my only comment.&quot;</p>

<p>Even those not living in the East Village are riled up by the red, one woman in her 50s says, &quot;I don&apos;t even want to say [what the curtains make it look like]. If I lived in this neighborhood, I&apos;d be screaming too.&quot; Meanwhile, some are just fearing what the evil geniuses behind this comedy club have in store for the future&#x2014;one shuddered to think, &quot;red lamps?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154158/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36_vlZha7bg&amp;feature=related"><em>Backwards talking midgets</em></a>?</p>
