<p>This sign was spotted by one of our readers on the Upper East Side this morning, put there by the firefighters at East 85th Street who have lost their kitten. It reads: &quot;Please help find Carlo. He is a 5 month old unneutered kitten. He is missing from his post at the firehouse at 159 East 85th Street (between Lexington and 3rd Avenue). Carlo is white and orange with amber eyes. If you have seen or found Carlo please call 212-249-2762 or 646-245-2289 or bring him back to his firehouse. Thank you.&quot; </p>

<p>Have you seen Carlo? We&apos;ve reached out to the firehouse to get some more information about their cat and his disappearance, and will update when we hear back. In the meantime, they have sent us this additional photo:</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the firehouse&apos;s first cat, a few years ago their longtime cat Murray died&#x2014;there&apos;s a little plaque outside the station for him.</p>

<p>Earlier this year when we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181955/http://boingboing.net/2012/02/13/mickey-the-firefighting-cat.html">this vintage video</a> of Mickey the firefighting cat, we contacted the FDNY to find out how many firehouses had pets. We were told, &quot;Several firehouses have had, or currently do have, cats or dogs.  I don&apos;t have any official numbers or stats&quot; &#x2014; when we asked if we could visit with the cats, we were told no :( &#x2014;&#xA0;&quot;I don&apos;t know if we&apos;ve ever had a cat the caliber of Mickey; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181955/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLDgBWSIeOM&amp;lr=1&amp;uid=S-UChsbvCbIvqtC4pwGdvQ">we do have a dog</a> that Mickey can&apos;t hold a safe battery-operated candle too.&quot;</p>
