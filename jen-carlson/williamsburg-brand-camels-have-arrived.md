                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="camelburg012011.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109174320im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/camelburg012011.jpg" width="158" height="204" class="image-left"> </span>Despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109174320/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/17/health_commish_wants_to_keep_camel.php">an effort</a> to get the campaign dropped, R.J. Reynolds has now officially brought their Williamsburg-branded Camels to consumers. One smoker at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109174320/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/3/dtg_campbellsmoke_2011_1_28_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> procured a pack, noting there&apos;s nothing different in the taste; that&apos;s right, these cigs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109174320/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/11/williamsburg.php">don&apos;t taste like</a> a &quot;last call, a sloppy kiss goodbye&quot; <em>or</em> &quot;a solo saunter to a rock show in an abandoned building.&quot; Unless those things taste like Benzene, Formaldehyde, Ammonia, and... actually, it&apos;s entirely possible a rock show at an abandoned building could taste like that. </p>

<p>The cigarettes were widely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109174320/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/12/locals_trash_camels_burg_butts.php">criticized by smokers</a>, but Camel&apos;s gimmick is working, and stores in Greenpoint and Williamsburg are selling out as soon as their stocked back up. One smoker told the paper, &#x201C;I smoke Marlboro, but whenever I see the Williamsburg [Camels] I buy it. I live in the neighborhood, so it&#x2019;s cool to have.&quot; Really?</p>

<p>Anyway, this could all have to do with the fact that Camel has marked their Williamsburg packs <em>down</em> in price, selling at just $10.79 a pack (they typically sell for $12.50 to $14).</p>
