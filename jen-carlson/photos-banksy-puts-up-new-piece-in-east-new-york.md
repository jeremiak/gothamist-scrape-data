<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023240/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> just posted these photos of his latest piece, which is in East New York (alert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023240/https://twitter.com/PaulCantor/status/387979630881169408">this guy</a>). The piece&#x2014;significantly smaller than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023240/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/new_dramatic_banksy_piece_goes_up_o.php">the massive installation</a> on the Lower East Side yesterday&#x2014;depicts a beaver standing triumphantly next to a street sign he felled with his chompers.</p>

<p>Since some people leaving comments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023240/http://instagram.com/p/fSrISzK-1n/">on his Instagram</a> seem to think this piece is on the East Side of Manhattan, we feel compelled to add here that no, no it is not. It&apos;s in <em>East New York</em>, in Brooklyn. We&apos;ll update when we find out the cross streets.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The piece is still up as of 1 p.m., and is located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023240/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=pitkin+and+bradford+brooklyn&amp;ll=40.672387,-73.892112&amp;spn=0.006681,0.010965&amp;sll=40.672445,-73.892131&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,83.47,,0,-4.41&amp;cbll=40.672286,-73.89209&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=Pitkin+Ave+%26+Bradford+St,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11207&amp;t=h&amp;panoid=1LFZnDB53TryV6t1Vt0RaQ&amp;z=17">Bradford and Pitkin</a>.</p>

<p>And people are already trying to chisel out the wall: </p>
