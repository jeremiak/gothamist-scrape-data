<p>Runners will be free to take to the grounds between noon and 6 p.m., <em>Friday only</em>, but according to the press release they sent out: &quot;Joggers are asked to show proper respect for those who are grieving or visiting the final resting places of family members and loved ones.&quot;</p>

<p>If you plan to take advantage of the rare opportunity, you can enter the cemetery at 20th Street and Prospect Park West, 25th Street and 5th Avenue, or 35th Street and 4th Avenue.</p>
