<span class="photo_caption">Not ready to let go... of summer. (Still from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209175259/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_love_story.php"><em>Love Story</em></a>, a film about living, skating, and dying.)</span></p>

<p>While some of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209175259/http://gothamist.com/tags/iceskating">ice skating</a> rinks won&apos;t open &apos;til November, our centerpiece slab of ice at Rockefeller Center will open for blade business <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209175259/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/ice-skating-starts-saturday-new-york-city-article-1.2386969">this weekend</a>. Weren&apos;t we just drinking iced coffee and swimming at Fort Tilden last week? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209175259/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/watch_the_bryant_park_movie_lawn_ru.php">Trampling over</a> our fellow New Yorkers for a sweet spot on the Bryant Park lawn? What time is Autumn? Where are our pants? What&apos;s a scarf? Whatever happened to taking things slow, seasons? Happy New Year, 2016 is gonna rock.</p>

<p>The Rink at Rockefeller Center opens Saturday, October 10th, followed by Bryant Park&apos;s Winter Village, which opens on October 30th. Wollman Rink in Central Park will open around the same time (exact date TBD), and the rest seem to be opening in November. We&apos;ll provide a full ice skating rink guide when we accept that summer is over.</p>
