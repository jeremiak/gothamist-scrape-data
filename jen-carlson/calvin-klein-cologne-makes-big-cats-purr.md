The Wildlife Conservation Society&apos;s (WCS) Jaguar Conservation Program uses hidden cameras as a primary source for observing and tracking jaguars, and rely on the cologne&apos;s complex scent to lure their subjects, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155445/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100609/od_nm/us_jaguars_calvinklein">Reuters</a>. While there&apos;s no success rate given&#x2014;though they plan to expand the use of the cologne in their studies&#x2014;we&apos;re guessing it&apos;s similar to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155445/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLq2-uZd5LY">Sex Panther scent by Odeon</a>: &quot;60% of the time, it works every time.&quot;</p>
