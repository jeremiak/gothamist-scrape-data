(How long before Larry Flynt&apos;s people come in and rip that gate down?) That&apos;s at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023306/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Larry+Flynt&apos;s+NY+Hustler+Club+%26+Cigar+Lounge&amp;ll=40.766388,-73.994679&amp;spn=0.012351,0.026436&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=hell&apos;s+kitchen+hustlers+club&amp;cid=0,0,11335072513644440303&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.767296,-73.996038&amp;panoid=6ospFlV_uIeS7IjOaY-dsg&amp;cbp=12,36.15,,0,3.08">641 West 51st Street</a> <em>as if you don&apos;t already know</em>. His caption reads: &quot;Waiting in vain... at the door of the club.&quot; But what does it all mean? </p>

<blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023306/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen</a>: Do you think it&apos;s commentary on how Banksy is a hustler, or is he just trying to keep the dying strip club in biz alive?<br><br>

<p>This is the 24th day of his month-long open-air residency, Better Out Than In&#x2014;only 7 days left! Start preparing yourself for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023306/https://twitter.com/johndelsignore/status/391289891222331392">post-Banksy depression</a> now.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 11:10 a.m.:</strong> Jen Chung is on the scene, and was told that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023306/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php#photo-9">Big Red</a> was spotted leaving the scene when the crowd started showing up.</p>

<p>The club is very aware of the piece: </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 11:50 p.m.:</strong> A security guard is now protecting the piece for the owner. This is Jesse Wright, who handles security for the owner. He will let you pose with it if you ask him nicely. They will obviously be trying to preserve the piece. We asked if he liked the piece, and he said, &quot;I do&#x2014;it&apos;s nice!&quot; Though he didn&apos;t know Banksy before now: &quot;I was trying to Google him but you can&apos;t text and drive at the same time!&quot;</p>

<p>A mounted unit cop showed up, but told us he was not there for crowd control, he was just taking the horse to the stable.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 2 p.m.:</strong> The Hustler Club&apos;s New York Marketing Director, Steve Karel, offered us this statement: &quot;We&apos;re honored that Banksy chose the Larry Flynt&apos;s Hustler Club New York to share his art.  We respect the art and artist;  while we&apos;d love to leave the work in place, it&apos;s required we lift the gate when we open for business, so after the public has the day to enjoy it, we will remove the door to keep it safe from vandals until we determine where it can be displayed in the future&#x2014;hopefully inside of the club.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE from LA:</strong> There is no upcoming Banksy residency in LA, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023306/http://laist.com/2013/10/24/banksy_la_site_causes_confusion.php">his publicist confirmed with us</a>.</p>
