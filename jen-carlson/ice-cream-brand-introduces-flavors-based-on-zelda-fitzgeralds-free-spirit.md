<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509003442/http://gothamist.com/tags/bazluhrmann">Baz Luhrmann</a>&apos;s 3-D interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509003442/http://gothamist.com/tags/greatgatsby"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a> is hitting the big screen in just a precious few days, but maybe if you haven&apos;t been outside or online you didn&apos;t know that. If you <em>were</em> to open your eyes to the great, big world out there, however, you&apos;d see that everyone has gone MAD trying to market their products in a way that aligns with the blockbuster. Even when it makes no sense! Like this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509003442/https://twitter.com/Becca_PR/status/331422015598759936">Zelda Collection ICE CREAM</a>. The description reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;From her free spirit arises the Zelda Collection, a super-limited-edition set of ice creams made with top-shelf ingredients from around the world and homegrown attention to details. Your spirited companion and guide is Zelda, a woman who truly embodied an American age of living in the moment. The collection takes you from Zelda&apos;s childhood home in Alabama, to New York, St. Paul, Paris, and on through the Roaring Twenties.&quot;</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509003442/http://jenis.com/the-zelda-collection/">The flavors include</a> Blackberries + Sweet Cream, Loveless Biscuits + Peach Jam, and Dark Chocolate Rye and Cognac + Marmalade as a tip o&apos; the hat to the Fitzgerald&apos;s dangerous relationship with alcohol. What about when her &quot;free spirit&quot; got her institutionalized&#x2014;what flavor is that one?</p>
