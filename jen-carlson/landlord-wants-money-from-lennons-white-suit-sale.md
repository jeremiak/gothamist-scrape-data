<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lennonsuit011711.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131307im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lennonsuit011711.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="image-left"> </span>Recently more of John Lennon&apos;s material items were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131307/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/03/lennons_white_suit_nyc_station_wago.php">sold off at auction</a>&#x2014;this time around his famous white suit (as seen on the cover of <em>Abbey Road</em>), and his green 1972 Chrysler station wagon (as seen on the streets of Manhattan). There&apos;s just one problem: the man who sold these items owes a lot of back rent for his former Manhattan apartment, and the landlord has come knockin&apos;. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131307/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jJhfoABsRGcSicHCF0dNBT1RiO7g?docId=4ddb0b0c0e8747f79c04e1418e9e0d1e">the AP</a>, the seller&apos;s former landlord has sued the gallery that auctioned the suit (for $46K) and wants the proceeds to satisfy a rent debt.</p>

<p>Braswell Galleries, located in Norwalk, CT, was informed prior to the auction that a court determined seller Biond Fury owed more than $21,000 in rent to his former landlord Mark Arrow. Now Arrow wants that money from the gallery, saying his lawyer told them not to go through with the sale.</p>

<p>Arrow&apos;s lawyer, Adam Leitman Bailey, says they had new hopes of getting the money when they saw the auction listed in the paper. He declared: &quot;We&apos;re all coming together over John Lennon.&quot; Yep, just like that time Lennon came together with Strom Thurmond and the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>
