(via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140511080547/http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/12/21/stack-tour">NYPL</a>)</i></div> The area between West 42nd and West 40th Streets, and 5th and 6th Avenues, has undergone many transformations in the last 200 years. In the mid-1800s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140511080547/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/04/flashback_croton_reservoir.php#photo-1">the Croton Reservoir was built</a>. By the end of the century it was torn down. And by 1902 the cornerstone was laid for the New York Public Library&apos;s main branch. Today, images of the latest change have been released, showing the library&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140511080547/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/01/who_needs_books_nypl_main_branch_re.php">somewhat controversial</a> $300 million renovation.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140511080547/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/arts/design/new-york-public-library-offers-peek-at-renovation.html">The NY Times</a> says British architect Norman Foster &quot;has essentially created a major new contemporary library within Carr&#xE8;re &amp; Hastings&#x2019;s neo-Classical one.&quot; <em>Which sounds terrifying</em> for those who fear change, and since it was first announced, critics have been outspoken, many worrying the Main Reading Room will turn into a massive Starbucks. </p>

<p>The renovation will open up more of the library to the public, with 40% more space. The renovations will center around the area currently off-limits to the public, housing seven floors of stacks&#x2014;this will be transformed into a four-level atrium which will provide more sitting areas and desks for the public, as well as a view of Bryant Park.</p>

<p>While criticism continues to pile up&#x2014;architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable has said: &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t &#x2018;update&#x2019; a masterpiece&quot;&#x2014;lead designer Nigel Dancey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140511080547/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-public-library-flagship-branch-makeover-article-1.1223205?localLinksEnabled=false">promises</a>, &#x201C;None of the key spaces are being changed.&quot; And it&apos;s not like they&apos;re <em>burning the books</em>, the ones housed in the current stacks will be relocated to new ones underneath Bryant Park. Which sounds kind of cool. Plus, they will extend hours to be open 7 days a week, 12+ hours a day (on most days).</p>

<p>But what do you think, does it look too... Barnes &amp; Noble?</p>
