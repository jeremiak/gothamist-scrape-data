<p>Neon lights reflecting in a dark, slick street? Guess the year this photograph was taken, and where in New York City. As always, we&apos;ll update later with the answer and more details.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This photo was taken on 52nd Street in July of 1948. The caption reads: &quot;The Street is at its best at night, when the neons start to bloom. It loses some of its carnival atmosphere when daylight dims its gaudy luster.&quot;</p>
