</div></div>					<p>To be honest, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427002535/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/05/bald_eagle_1.php">the photo of the bald eagle</a> we posted last week near Fairway was just kind of depressing. There he was, pondering existence over icy waters, looking lonely, and <em>actually</em> balding. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427002535/http://yojimbot.blogspot.com/2010/02/more-harlem-eagles.html">the blogger</a> who spotted that one, spotted two more this week on an ice flow in Harlem; &quot;a huge female adult eagle finishing up a fish as another adult and juvenile begged for scraps!&quot; If you want to see one of these in real life, they&apos;re being spotted up and down Riverside Park... just watch out for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427002535/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/08/coyotes_at_columbia.php">packs of coyotes</a>.</p>
