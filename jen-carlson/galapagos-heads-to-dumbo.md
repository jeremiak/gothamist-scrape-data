										<p>There have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://www.curbed.com/archives/2006/12/21/williamsburg_rumor_galapagos_site_to_become_condo.php">been</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/12/brooklyns_galap.html">murmurs</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://www.galapagosartspace.com/">Galapagos</a> moving from its current space for a while now. The Burg even did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://theburg.tv/blog/category/episodes/episode-12-show/">an entire episode</a> about saving it. From that show:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Galapagos is many ways is the heart of Williamsburg, the oldest consistently operating bar in the area, it&apos;s been around for seven years - it&apos;s historic. And now I hear Clear Channel&apos;s trying to buy it.&quot; 

<p>&quot;I hate Clear Channel, first McCarren Park Pool and now this!&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Clear Channel didn&apos;t buy it (that we know of), maybe <strike>Northsix</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/02/music_hall_of_w.php">The Music Hall of Williamsburg</a> did - but likely it&apos;s going to be another set of condos (with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/05/the_future_of_n.php">neighbors complaining</a> about the noise). Either way, the rumors of it moving have been confirmed, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/theater/30gala.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports that the North 6th Street art space will be leaving Williamsburg for a brighter future in Dumbo. They also note this has great symbolic significance, given it was an establishment that pioneered the neighborhood it will now be leaving.</p>

With such a huge investment in the neighborhood that they basically created, an established cultural destination like Galapagos will help them out, as much as it will the venue - which is doubling its space and halving its rent. How much is the current rent for Galapagos? &quot;The monthly rent for the Galapagos space had increased to $10,000 a month in December 2005, and the landlords were asking for a 30 percent increase next month.&quot;</p>

<p>The environment will also benefit, as the Times reports: </p>

<blockquote>After renovation the building would be the first performance space in New York City certified as &#x201C;green&#x201D; under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards set by the United States Green Building Council.</blockquote>

<p>The current Galapagos Art Space will be opened through the weekend of June 17, with select events throughout the summer. One wonders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180223/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/05/the_future_of_n.php">what N 6th Street will look like</a> once it moves out for good in 2008. </p>
