                            <p>The photobomb is a delicate beast. One that needs to be tamed, reined in a little, <em>you don&apos;t want to overdo it</em>. And if you&apos;re a celebrity, you&apos;ll want to add your own little touch, but just try to be cool, man. Be subtle, don&apos;t take over the scene, <em>this isn&apos;t about you today</em>. Let&apos;s take a look at the latest example, which was captured by photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205200507/http://www.saschareinking.com/">Sascha Reinking</a>, who was recently photographing a newly married couple in the middle of the goddamn busy Manhattan streets. Look to the left, that man in the puffer coat enjoying a Peppermint Mocha... it&apos;s that guy from <em>Garden State</em>. </p>

<p>Reinking brought the photo to the attention of Zach Braff on Twitter, and the actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205200507/https://twitter.com/zachbraff/status/403735893099286530">called it</a> one of his &quot;best photobombs ever&quot;... &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205200507/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziwr4f5eR0M">It&apos;ll change your life I swear</a>.&quot;</p>
