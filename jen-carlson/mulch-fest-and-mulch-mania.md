<p>Don&apos;t just toss your tannenbaum out onto the sidewalk; this weekend there are two events designed for the ultimate holiday arboricidal massacre. First up is the city&apos;s annual MulchFest, which invites you to bring your tree in to a designated city park (they&apos;ll open up shop in all five boroughs), where it will be turned into nourishing mulch. &quot;You are encouraged to bring bags to take advantage of the free mulch&quot; that will be provided at certain sites. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120122213829/http://www.nycgovparks.org/services/mulchfest/mulchfest.html">More details here</a>.</p>

<p>Next up is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120122213829/http://www.downtownny.com/news?nid=155">Mulch Mania</a>! Brought to you by the Alliance for Downtown New York, the event will &quot;assist Lower Manhattan residents with efforts to recycle their holiday trees for free in an environmentally safe manner.&quot; This one <em>isn&apos;t</em> citywide, taking place only in Bowling Green Park (MulchFest will be there Saturday too, <em>awkward</em>), and they&apos;ve even set up a shuttle bus for you and your tree. Along with free mulch, they&apos;ll be serving up refreshments as well. <strong>Update:</strong> The MulchMania people tell us that they and MulchFest are one in the same. But maybe they&apos;re just <em>saying</em> that to get more trees! Eco warriors unite for MulchFeud &apos;09!</p>
