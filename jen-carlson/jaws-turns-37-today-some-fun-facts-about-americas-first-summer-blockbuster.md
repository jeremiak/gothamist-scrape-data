<p><em>Jaws</em> is one of the greatest (if not <em>the</em> greatest) movies of all time (even better than <em>Goonies</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507135943/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/goonies_v_jaws_which_beloved_flick.php">no matter what some stupid <em>poll</em> says</a>)&#x2014;and today it turns 37 years old. To celebrate Steven Spielberg&apos;s prototypical summer blockbuster, here&apos;s some trivia chum to chew on:</p><ul><li>Yes, it was the first summer blockbuster. It was #1 at the box office for 14 consecutive weeks and the first film to gross more than $100 million (eventually grossing over $470 million).<br>
</li><li>The movie was based on the novel by Peter Benchley, who was inspired by a 1964 article about a fisherman who caught a 4550-lb great white shark off the shores of Long Island. (Making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507135943/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/montauk_shark_fishing.php#photo-1">today&apos;s sharks</a> look like guppies.)<br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <div class="image-right"> <img alt="frank0612.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507135943im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/frank0612.jpeg" width="226" height="191"> <br> <i style=" width:226px; ;display:block"> Frank Mundus</i></div> </span></li><li>That fisherman&apos;s name was Frank Mundus, and the character Quint was based off of him.<br>
</li><li>The scene introducing Quint was supposed to show the character in a movie theater watching and laughing at the fake qualities of <em>Moby Dick</em>, but Spielberg was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507135943/http://trackofthecat.blogspot.com/2011/07/moby-dick-gillian-anderson-john-hurt.html">unable to get the rights</a>, later noting that &#x201C;Gregory Peck felt it wasn&#x2019;t his proudest work; he didn&#x2019;t want it to be made fun of or even to be in the film at all.&#x201D;<br>
</li><li>One of the mechanical sharks used in the movie was lost at sea when the movie was still filming, and the rest of the sharks (called &quot;Bruce&quot;) were later destroyed... except one, which was spotted in a junkyard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507135943/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/07/search_for_bruce_the_jaws_shark.php#photo-1">in 2010</a>.<br>
</li><li>Filming from the shark&apos;s perspective was not a directorial choice, Spielberg did it because the mechanical sharks kept breaking. Though this ended up making the movie that much more suspenseful.</li></ul><br>

<ul><li>The beach town of Amity is really the fishing village of Menemsha on Martha&apos;s Vineyard... or at least, that was the primary location for shooting.<br>
</li><li>When Spielberg first heard John Williams&apos;s score, he thought it was a joke&#x2014;the now famous shark theme was a simple alternating pattern of two notes. It went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score.<br>
</li><li>Upon its release, Rex Reed called the movie, &quot;nerve-frying... for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department.&quot; Meanwhile, <em>The New Yorker</em>&apos;s Pauline Kael called it &quot;funny in a Woody Allen sort of way.&quot;</li></ul><br>

<ul><li>In 1975 the movie made the cover of Time Magazine, with an article inside called &quot;Summer of the Shark&quot;&#x2014;you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507135943/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913189,00.html">read it here</a>.</li></ul><p></p>
