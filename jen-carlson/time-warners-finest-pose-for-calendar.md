<p>Knock knock! Who&apos;s there? It&apos;s the hunky Time Warner cable guy of your dreams! You know, the one that doesn&apos;t exist. The company has released a calendar for the new year, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152107/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/12/15/2008-12-15_workers_model_in_fun_time_warner_calenda.html">the Daily News</a> has revealed each month&apos;s photos (which include the men, and some women, of TWC). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152107/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/12/your_time_warner_cable_guy_fan.html">NYMag</a> declares that it will make all of your Time Warner Cable guy fantasies come true (except &quot;the ones where you murder the dude for telling you to be home from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. when he actually shows up at 3 p.m.&quot;). </p>

<p>One female TWC employee told the paper: &quot;We have the best-looking cable guys in the business.&quot; But it&apos;s a little surprising <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152107/http://gawker.com/387349/new-optimum-online-ad-trades-reggaeton-for-suburban-rb">Optimum Online</a> didn&apos;t come up with this one first. Next up: Con Ed?</p>

<p>Calendars are being given to staff, and can be requested by customers on their website. Check out all the months <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152107/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/galleries/time_warners_calendar_babes/time_warners_calendar_babes.html#ph0">here</a>.</p>
