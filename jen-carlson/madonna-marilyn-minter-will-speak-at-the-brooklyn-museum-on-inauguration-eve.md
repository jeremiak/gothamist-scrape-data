<p>On the evening before Donald J. Trump becomes the President of the United States of America [pause for fear, dread, denial, anger, gagging, productive organizing and resistance], the Brooklyn Museum will host a discussion with &quot;two fearless feminist provocateurs,&quot; Madonna and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115175734/https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/marilyn_minter_pretty_dirty">Marilyn Minter</a>. From their announcement, which was made Friday morning: </p>

<blockquote>On the eve of the presidential inauguration, join Madonna and Marilyn Minter as they talk art, culture, feminism, and the current state of affairs. Connecting Madonna, an artist, activist, and philanthropist, with Minter, whose work explores cultural perceptions of women, this unprecedented conversation will highlight the impact of female artists within broader culture and social change.
