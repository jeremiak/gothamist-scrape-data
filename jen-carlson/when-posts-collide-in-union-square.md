<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163522/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/02/photographing_every_interesting_new.php">Yesterday</a> we made note of photographer Brandon Stanton&apos;s mission to photograph every <em>interesting</em> New Yorker. Turns out he already stole the soul of one of the city&apos;s more eclectic women: Lady Gaga... who he spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163522/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/video_gaga_surprises_band_in_union.php">in Union Square this past Sunday</a>. Here&apos;s the close-up he snagged of Gaga as she silently judged that band publicly covering her latest single.</p>

<p>Two subjects of two different posts colliding at one pretty spontaneous event in Manhattan? Maybe this town really is smaller than we thought.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163522/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/gaga_gate_where_was_lady_gaga_on_su.php">That&apos;s not Lady Gaga</a>, that&apos;s an impersonator, baby.</p>
