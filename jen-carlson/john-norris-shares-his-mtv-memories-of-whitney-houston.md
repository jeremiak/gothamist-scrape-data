For those who grew up with MTV, there&apos;s just something more comforting about hearing John Norris or Kurt Loder&apos;s voice break news like this (you can also watch a statement that Norris filmed for CBS last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070841/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWuHHAK0-sU">here</a>). Norris, as an MTV veejay, met Houston and interviewed her for the network&apos;s Rockumentary in 1993 (you can watch that below). Here&apos;s what he told us last night:<br>
</p><blockquote>I guess I would just say that in any case like this (Michael for instance) my first thought is with someone&apos;s kids. In 1993 Whitney and Bobby took me into the nursery of their Miami condo to see a sleeping Bobbi Kristina in her crib. They could not have been happier. <p></p>

<p>I lost my mom when she was only a little older than Whitney, and I was only a little older than Bobbi Kristina. So yeah, that&apos;s really really hard, and I hope Bobbi Kristina is okay.</p>

<p>Whitney? A lovely, funny, fragile and insanely gifted woman.</p></blockquote> <br>
Meanwhile, MTV was receiving some criticism last night on Twitter for not immediately airing the news or a tribute to the singer, instead, they kept with their normal line of programming. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070841/https://twitter.com/#!/sportsguy33/status/168524238158958592">Bill Simmons</a> wrote, &quot;Can&apos;t believe MTV refuses to bump the reprehensible <em>Teen Mom</em> for all-night Whitney coverage. That channel has lost its way.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070841/https://twitter.com/#!/nprmonkeysee/status/168552197926289408">NPR wrote</a>, &quot;Whitney Houston&apos;s death is a time when it would be great if MTV still existed.&quot; Finally, at 11:30 p.m., almost four hours after the news broke, MTV acknowledged the singer&apos;s death on air, announcing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070841/https://twitter.com/#!/mtvnews/status/168542889431928832">on Twitter</a> that they would play an hour long music video tribute.<p></p>

<p>Some background on Houston and the network: In 1985, just four years after launching, MTV was criticized for not playing enough videos by racial minorities. That year, Houston released the video for her single &quot;How Will I Know,&quot; which ended up introducing her to the MTV audience. She was the first African-American female artist to receive consistent heavy rotation on MTV. Sadly, by 2001, when Houston was just 37, MTV had started collecting B-roll for her obit, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070841/http://www.salon.com/2006/04/12/whitney_houston_3/">an honor normally reserved for geriatrics</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Below is the 1993 interview Norris did with Houston, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070841/http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/733104/whitney-houston-talks-with-mtv-news-john-norris-in-1999.jhtml">here is another one from 1999</a>.</p>
