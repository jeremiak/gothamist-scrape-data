Reportedly he was busted in San Fransisco&apos;s Union Square for being in a restricted area. Who knew San Francisco would be so opposed to a nearly naked man, especially on the day of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619053144/http://sfist.com/2008/07/28/dore_alley_fair_photos_uhh_yeah_the.php">Up Your Alley Fair</a>?  The arresting officers didn&apos;t realize this was <em>the</em> Naked Cowboy at first, but once they did, it didn&apos;t stop them from cuffing him. He told The Post that the cops laughed nonstop, &quot;<strong>They&apos;re laughing hysterically because there&apos;s this guy in his underwear.</strong> Then they were like, &apos;Oh, that&apos;s the Naked Cowboy.&apos;&quot; In the end he was given a citation for &quot;violating a posted sign,&quot; and is due in court today.</p>
