<p>On December 25th, 1977, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171008/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/25/newsid_2542000/2542535.stm">Charlie Chaplin died</a> in his sleep in Switzerland at the age of 88.</p>

<p>Back in the U.S., the Bee Gees &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; and Dolly Parton&apos;s &quot;Here You Come Again&quot; played on the radio.</p>

<p>Penn State beat Arizona State in the Fiesta Bowl.</p>

<p>Kids were hoping to find <em>Star Wars</em> action figures under the tree... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171008/https://www.yahoo.com/movies/the-first-worst-star-wars-christmas-a-look-182628649.html">but found disappointment instead</a>.</p>

<p>Jimmy Carter was in the Oval Office, probably grinning.</p>

<p>It was a fairly uneventful date in history, <em>except</em> there was also a full moon that night. The last Christmas night full moon we&apos;ve had in 38 years, actually. That&apos;s all about to change, though. </p>

<p>A NASA spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171008/http://abcnews.go.com/US/full-moon-light-christmas-time-1977/story?id=35724307">told ABC</a> that &quot;a full moon will occur on Christmas for the first time since 1977 and will reach its peak size at 6:11 a.m. ET.&quot; After this, we won&apos;t see another December 25th full moon until 2034. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171008/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/02/mtv_and_gen_z_can_go_2_hell.php">The Founders</a> will be all grown up by then. The Millennials will be middle-aged. The rest of us will be too old to give a shit about full moon.</p>

<p>According to the Farmer&apos;s Almanac, December&apos;s full moon is called a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171008/http://www.almanac.com/content/cold-moon-december-full-moon-phases">Full Cold Moon</a>&#x2014;&quot;it is the month when the winter cold fastens its grip and the nights become long and dark.&quot; They also claim that &quot;if a snowstorm begins when the moon is young, it will cease at moonrise.&quot; They have no predictions for what will happen when we&apos;re experiencing springtime temperatures during a Full Cold Moon, however, so we&apos;re in uncharted waters with this one.</p>
