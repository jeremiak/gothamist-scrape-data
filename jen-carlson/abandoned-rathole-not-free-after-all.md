Unsurprisingly, the whole thing was a prank. Reportedly a local resident was fed up with the rundown building (located at 205 Parkside Avenue) and decided to put up a sign and a Craigslist ad advertising it for free.<p></p>

<p>The prankster told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144540/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/11/04/2009-11-04_resident_mocks_prospectlefferts_rathole_with_phony_craigslit_ad_flyers.html?r=ny_local">the Daily News</a>: &quot;We want to see something positive happening with the building [not just a] festering rathole on what could be a lively thriving commercial strip.&quot;</p>

<p>The 80-year-old owner of the building, Moses Fried, was not happy with the prank, particularly because it included his name and phone number. He told the paper, &quot;I didn&apos;t find it funny. It was crude. If I knew who did it, I would sue them. People were calling all day.&quot;</p>

<p>That person is definitely remaining anonymous, but says the goal <em>was</em> to irritate him; &quot;My hope was frankly that he would get some calls, that it would kind of shame him... that he would actually sell it or do something with it.&quot; Fried says he&apos;s been waiting on paperwork before he can move forward with plans to renovate it into a 20-family residential building.</p>
