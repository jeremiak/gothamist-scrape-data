<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to LIFE magazine, this is &quot;Fortune magazine photographer Margaret Bourke-White preparing to take a picture from high atop a NYC building in 1931.&quot; In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216043555/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1175402">NPR</a> article, they write that &quot;Bourke-White was one of the most famous photojournalists of the 20th century,&quot; and one of her photos made the cover of the very first issue of Life magazine.&quot; As for the above photo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216043555/http://www.nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID021.htm">allegedly</a> &quot;George Chappell, the New Yorker&apos;s architecture critic, denounced Chrysler&apos;s building as &apos;a stunt design, evolved to make the man in the street look up.&apos; In response, Chrysler hired famed photographer Margaret Bourke-White to climb 1,000 feet and take sweeping photos of his building.&quot; <a 14="" 2009="" href="a href=" http:="" hilobrow.com="" 06="" hilo-hero-margaret-bourke-white="" "="">Here&apos;s another shot</a> of her up there.</p>
