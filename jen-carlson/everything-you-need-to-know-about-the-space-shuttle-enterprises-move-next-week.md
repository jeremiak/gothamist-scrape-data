<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155759/http://gothamist.com/tags/spaceshuttleenterprise">Space Shuttle Enterprise</a> has been resting at JFK Airport for the month of May, following its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155759/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/27/photos_the_space_shuttle_enterprise.php#photo-1">flight over the city</a>, and now it&apos;s on the move again with two days of water travel coming up next week. Here&apos;s the schedule, so you&apos;ll know where and when to spot it (of course, all of dates and times could change if the weather doesn&apos;t cooperate).</p><ul><li><strong>This morning</strong> at JFK the Enterprise was rolled over on its trailer to the Weeks Marine barge, which will eventually ferry it to its new home at the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum. <br>
</li><li><strong>Tomorrow, June 2nd</strong>, sometime after 4 p.m., the Enterprise will be lifted by a crane and placed onto the barge, this is about a three hour process.<br>
</li><li><strong>On Sunday</strong>, the real photo ops begin. The Enterprise will depart JFK, towed by a Weeks Marine tugboat, and will travel along the shore of Queens and Brooklyn, passing the Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge at 3:30 p.m.; Coney Island at 4:19 p.m.; and under the Verrazano Bridge at 5:34 p.m. before docking at Weeks Marine in Port Elizabeth, NJ at 6 p.m. <br>
</li><li>The Enterprise will remain on the barge in NJ <strong>on Monday</strong>.<br>
</li><li><strong>On Tuesday, June 5th</strong>, at 9:15 a.m., the barge and shuttle will leave Weeks Marine, passing the Statue of Liberty at 9:50 a.m.; the World Trade Center at 10:40 a.m.; and travel up the Hudson River, completing its journey at the Intrepid Museum at 11:30 a.m. where it will be lifted by crane onto the flight deck and put into position facing the Hudson River.</li></ul>If you spot the shuttle on the move, feel free to send your photos to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155759/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">photos@gothamist.com</a>; hashtag them #Gothamist and #Enterprise on Instagram; or tag them &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr. <p></p>

<p>The Enterprise won&apos;t officially be on exhibit to the public <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155759/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/the_space_shuttle_enterprise_will_o.php">until July 19th</a>, when it will be housed in a temporary climate-controlled pavilion, as its more permanent home gets constructed.<br>
