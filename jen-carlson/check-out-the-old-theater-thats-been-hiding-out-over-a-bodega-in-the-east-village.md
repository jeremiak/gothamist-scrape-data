Local photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130070457/http://kevinsheaadams.com/">Kevin Shea Adams</a> recently got curious about what condition the old theater <em>above</em> the bodega was in, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130070457/http://aleceiffelphoto.tumblr.com/post/16444390776/death-of-a-bodega">here&apos;s what he found</a> when he was granted permission to explore it after midnight one night.<p></p>

<blockquote>A giant windowless brick shell traversed only by an old, warped fire escape juts up some 40ft directly above the store front, a giant black box. I learned from people in the neighborhood that this was once the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130070457/http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/520">old Hollywood Theatre</a> which shut down in 1959, but what was more surprising was when I found out it wasn&#x2019;t just another dusty, gutted empty space but was the functional store room for my dearest bodega!

<p>I showed up with my camera and tripod... Walking through the back past all the things you would expect and up a small staircase deposits you stage-left in this little store&#x2019;s swollen subconscious.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150130070457/http://evgrieve.com/2012/01/inside-old-theater-at-east-village.html">EV Grieve</a> also has some photos from an earlier explorer of the space, who says, &quot;I&apos;m not sure the building is worth saving&#x2014;the cool parts of it seem really run down and unusable&#x2014;but the ornate period works need to be preserved as best as they can. I would love to have a theater there, but I suspect it&apos;s headed for new housing.&quot;</p>
