<p>In upsetting yet unsurprising news, another longtime Manhattan record store is shutting its doors. Rebel Rebel Records&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703034900/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/best_record_stores_nyc.php">one of the best</a>&#x2014;has run its charmingly messy shop out of 319 Bleecker Street for 28 years, but the rent has gotten too high and owner David Shebiro is closing up at the end of June, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703034900/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2016/06/rebel-rebel-records.html">Vanishing New York</a>. </p>

<p>Shebiro said &quot;that the owner of the building has raised the rent and they plan to put another basic &apos;high-end&apos; clothing store in its place.&quot; Oh.</p>

<p>Vanishing notes that it&apos;s possible that clothing store is one of the record shop&apos;s current neighbors, Scotch &amp; Soda or St. James, planning an expansion. Gotta put those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703034900/https://www.scotch-soda.com/us/en/women/jumpsuits/silk-striped-dungarees/131532.html?dwvar_131532_color=combo%20Z&amp;cgid=1122&amp;start=6&amp;cgid=1122&amp;start=6">$300 silk striped jumpsuits</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703034900/http://www.saintjames-usa.com/women-striped-t-shirts.php">Hamptons-tees</a> somewhere!</p>
