<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hunterssm0811.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062058im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hunterssm0811.jpg" width="300" height="214" class="image-right"> </span>If you&apos;re going to get this kind of rejection letter it might as well be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062058/http://flavorwire.com/202229/see-a-colorful-rejection-letter-from-hunter-s-thompson">penned by Hunter S. Thompson</a>. <em>Rolling Stone</em> should keep this on file to send out to other worthy rejectees. Writer Mike Peterson sent a scan of his rejection to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062058/http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/07/jam-this-morbid-drivel-up-your-ass.html">Letters of Note</a>, who have some background&#x2014;&quot;Written in 1971, at which point young Mike was a resident of South Bend, Indiana, the furious missive was sent in response to a piece of satire he submitted to <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine; unluckily for him&#x2014;or luckily, depending on your angle&#x2014;said piece was forwarded to Hunter for assessment.&quot; You can read it in full below:</p>

<blockquote>You worthless, acid-smoking piece of illiterate shit! Don&apos;t ever send this kind of brain-damaged swill in here again. If I had the time, I&apos;d come out there and drive a fucking wooden stake into your forehead. Why don&apos;t you get a job, germ? Maybe delivering advertising handouts door to door, or taking tickets for a wax museum. You drab South Bend cocksuckers are all the same; like those dope-addled dingbats at the <em>Rolling Stone</em> offices. I&apos;d like to kill those bastards for sending me your piece... and I&apos;d just as soon kill you, too. Jam this morbid drivel up your ass where your readership will better appreciate it. 

<p>P.S. Keep up the good work. Have a nice day.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Sort of makes one miss the days of typewritten letters. Now, Mike, it&apos;s time to make that submission public!</p>

<p>This was just one of many letters written by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062058/http://gothamist.com/tags/huntersthompson">Thompson</a>, of course. Another one worth reading is a job application letter, which he wrote from his basement apartment at 57 Perry Street. He was applying to the Vancouver Sun, saying, &quot;Most of my experience has been in sports writing, but I can write everything from warmongering propaganda to learned book reviews. I can work 25 hours a day if necessary, live on any reasonable salary, and don&#x2019;t give a black damn for job security, office politics, or adverse public relations.&quot; Read the full thing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062058/http://thefuturebuzz.com/2010/10/06/hunters-thompsons-letter/">here</a>.</p>
