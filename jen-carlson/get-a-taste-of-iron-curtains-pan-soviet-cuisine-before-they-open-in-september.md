<p>This Saturday at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023520/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/15/the_hester_street_fair_brings_twili.php">Hester Street Fair</a> (anytime between 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.) you&apos;ll be able to try some pan-Soviet cuisine from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023520/http://www.ironcurtainnyc.com/">Iron Curtain</a>&#x2014;a restaurant that doesn&apos;t currently have a storefront, but plans to open one in the West Village in September. At the fair they&apos;ll be featuring Ponchiki, which are little nuggets that are deep fried until golden, filled with zesty lemon curd and finished with a glaze. They suggest you pair it even ryazhenka, a tangy baked yogurt.</p>

<p>The good folks behind the Iron Curtain tell us: &quot;We&apos;re a new kind of Soviet restaurant in New York. Notice, we said Soviet, not Russian. That&apos;s because instead of focusing on Russian food we&apos;d like to give you a taste of the Soviet Union&quot; because &quot;the USSR was made up of 15 republics, stretching from Europe to Asia; each with a different people and very different food.&quot;</p>

<p>Once they officially open, they&apos;ll be featuring one dish from somewhere in the former CCCP every few months. Until then, check out some more pan-Soviet food porn on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407023520/https://www.facebook.com/IronCurtainNYC">their Facebook page</a>.</p>
