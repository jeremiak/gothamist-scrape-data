Today U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero rejected Louboutin&#x2019;s lawsuit against YSL, and request to stop sales on their own red-soled shoe, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011421/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-10/louboutin-loses-court-bid-to-block-yves-saint-laurent-red-sole-shoe-sales.html">Bloomberg</a> reports.</p>

<p>The judge explained, &#x201C;Because in the fashion industry color serves ornamental and aesthetic functions vital to robust competition, the court finds that Louboutin is unlikely to be able to prove that its red outsole brand is entitled to trademark protection.&quot;</p>

<p>Louboutin introduced the red-sole in 1992, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded them trademark on it in 2008. The company&apos;s lawyer says it&apos;s &quot;the lifeblood of the company,&quot; but YSL&apos;s lawyer says it&apos;s &#x201C;a trademark registration that never should have been issued and can&#x2019;t be enforced,&quot; and now seeks to have the trademark cancelled. They&apos;ll be back in a Manhattan courtroom on August 17th, where Louboutin can argue against the cancellation of the trademark. We&apos;re guessing pretty soon we&apos;ll all be able to buy a version of these puppies at Payless.</p>
