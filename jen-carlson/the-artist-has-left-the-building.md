Sit for 45 minutes and some times longer rummaging and scrambling for meaning, surveying a desolate shoreâ¦. voyeurs toying in moralistic prostitution. Such is the contract between modern art, its successors, and a society whereby the modes of its own psychiatry are also its results.\r\n\r\nThe next morning comes, and desperation follows. Drugs for the waking logic â the kind that substitute wellbeing for collapse â an adequate amount is swallowed daily. The private ritual of coffee, of breakfast or not, of getting into the car, onto the subway.\r\n\r\nWe may have a future together.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement to participate in such a drama tickles our spleen. By pandering to the desolation of the audience and its tragic sensibilities, this art object subsumes all, as against the exteriority of the more archaic forms and their gestures. Here, we find the logical conclusion for a society of innovative modes of panhandling, a whisper of an unconventional conventionality.\r\n\r\nThe museum is our church. Exhausted by the daily routine, we have come in droves. The language of performance â the sermon â provides us refuge within the imprecise and ambiguous. It is an attribute shared by both artists and journalists, whereby the votary is allotted the ability to makes its own prognosis, to repent its own sins, to find salvation of its own accord. There is not doubt anymore that the spectacular value of democracy traverses all cultural indulgences.\r\n\r\nA deceit, unbelievable at first, legitimizes with greater ease when its extravagance appears incompatible with its sponsorship by respectable official authorities. Marina merely confirms the necessary trajectory of even the most repugnant luxuries. It is only a matter of time before the surrealist acte gratuit, to fire a pistol into a crowd at random, becomes a healthy over the counter pres\cription for combating the mass neurosis that constitutes everyday life.\r\n\r\nWe have come to sit with Marina, whore of Babylon, and confess. Speech superfluous, pure form against pure form, the reflection of an emptiness full of value. We have come as the last spectators before the crucifixion. We sit, as apostles at her table, and our nonchalance betrays her.\r\n\r\nOur flaccid heads having met â we dream of Botox. Under fluorescent lights we imagine an army of artists who nobly march in step with the congregation. At least, as motif, we can still infer superior lacerations, while our brothers must be content to sing in a far off repressive land. The consequence has always been emesis, whether choked back into the throat by tolerable acidic indigestion, or violently projected into an era that cultivates the thruster.\"", "credit":"Photo by \<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimkiernan/4659073048/\"\>Jim Kiernan\<\/a\>"};galleryObj['photo_7'] = photo;</script>

</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114702/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovi%C4%87">Marina Abramovi&#x107;</a> retrospective has now officially ended, with all of the prolific performance artist&apos;s pieces&#x2014;the naked strangers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114702/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/marina.php">the skeleton</a> draped over flesh&#x2014;taking their leave of MoMA, along with the artist herself. We already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114702/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/31/the_artist_is_present_with_vomit.php">heard about</a> some of the closing day craziness, but photographer Jim Kiernan was on hand and provided us with some more inside info (and illegal photographs!).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the final day, there was a time limit to sit with Abramovi&#x107;, limiting visitors to just 10 minutes of face-to-face action. On top of the puker, the nude, and the person who dropped a leaflet titled &quot;The Artist Is Putrescent,&quot; superfan Paco Blancas was also on hand, as was Lauren Hutton. Rumor has it they weren&apos;t giving special VIP treatment to famous faces yesterday&#x2014;though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114702/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/the_artist_is_present_for_vips.php">they have in the past</a>. </p>

<p>Some more rumor-mongering: Kiernan tells us that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114702/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/06/rumor_lady_gaga_to_go_face_to_face.php">Lady Gaga</a> wanted to cut the line but wasn&apos;t allowed when she visited in early May. (Maybe Marina&apos;s not a fan?) And about that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114702/http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/66163/">bathroom mystery</a>: we&apos;re told that she used a catheter throughout the run.</p>

<p>So, are you <em>so over</em> this robed lady or are you going to be crying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429114702/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/11/marina_2.php">Paco Blancas-style</a> now that she&apos;s departed?</p>
