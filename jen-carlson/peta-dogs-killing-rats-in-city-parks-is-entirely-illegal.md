To recap: a video emerged recently of a dog hunting rats for sport in Washington Square Park, killing nearly 15 in one night. But is that <em>legal</em>, even if the city does have a rat problem?</p>

<p>The animal rights organization&apos;s Martin Mersereau said, <strong>&quot;Setting dogs upon rats is depraved, sadistic, and entirely illegal. It constitutes an explicit violation of New York&#x2019;s anti-cruelty laws.&quot;</strong> He noted that there are two sections in New York&#x2019;s Agriculture and Markets Law that apply; one prohibits anyone from unjustifiably injuring, maiming, or killing an animal, and another prohibits fights between any animals. </p>

<p>Allegedly every species is protected by these laws, even a rat. Mersereau suggests calling the ASPCA if you witness a rat attack, and notes that rat-killing dogs aren&apos;t going to solve the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728223926/http://gothamist.com/tags/ratdemic">ratdemic</a>. We&apos;ve contacted the Parks Department again to get their comment on this law... that they should probably be aware of?</p>
