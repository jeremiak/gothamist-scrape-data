Tonight they play Mercury Lounge&#x2014;it&apos;s now sold out but we suggest you get a taste of their live show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022182236/http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/episode/2085-cold-cave/1">here</a> and catch them next time around. The group consists of Caralee McElroy (formerly Xiu Xiu), Dominick Fernow and Wesley Eisold (formerly American Nightmare/Give Up The Ghost and Some Girls). This week Mr. Eisold was kind enough to answer some of our questions...</em></p>

<p><strong>You played in a bunch of pretty well-known hardcore bands that were quite the opposite of Cold Cave&#x2014;how did the changeover occur?</strong> It&apos;s not something that I really think about. I only have one hand so playing a guitar or the drums is not an option. So I tried making music with synths and pedals and it felt comfortable. Its only other people who remind me that I&apos;ve changed. I can&apos;t imagine life any other way. When its a matter of necessity something so small as sound or genre never enters my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Did your songwriting process change? Can you tell us a bit about that process?</strong> I went from being a part of bands in the past, where ideas come from various capable people, to recording and writing alone and embracing my incapabilities. </p>

<p><strong>How did the band come together?</strong> The other two members of Cold Cave now are friends through music. Dominick released the first Cold Cave 7&quot; on his label, Hospital Productions. </p>

<p><strong>What have been your major influences throughout your life and as a musician?</strong> Oceans of insecurities. Sex.</p>

<p><strong>If you could create an all-star supergroup with musicians dead or alive, who would be in it?</strong> I tried to think of an answer but I get too practical and the idea becomes too detailed and then it seems horrid so I&apos;ll just work alone.</p>
