title: Dogs Have Nowhere to Run to in Park Slope

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="strollerpups.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191401im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/strollerpups.jpg" width="250" height="252"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191401/http://www.flickr.com/photos/popomoho/2842926412/">E-Bad&apos;s Flickr</a></span></i></div> The dog owners of the outer boroughs have oddly always seemed to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191401/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/15/pups.php">less outdoor space</a> for their canines than those in Manhattan; or maybe they just speak up about it more. Either way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191401/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/40/32_40_sj_south_slope_dog_run.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that dog owners of the South Slope &quot;have commandeered a small park near the Prospect Expressway for a dog run&quot; and are now angling to make it official. <p></p>

<p>The upbeat VP of the New York Council of Dog Owners Groups (it exists), says that usually these attempts fail, however, and &quot;are formed blissfully unaware of the four- to five-year process that lies before them. People move away, dogs get old. Most get frustrated and give up.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Still, Brooklyn is in desperate need of a dog run, currently there are only 11 enclosed runs, and with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191401/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/19/puppy-kicking_band_spotted_in_prosp.php">puppy kickers</a> running rampant in Prospect Park during leash-off hours, there&apos;s nearly nowhere to turn! As petitions get signed, Parks Department spokesman Phil Abramson advises, &#x201C;The group should be prepared to raise money towards installation and maintenance of the dog run.&quot;</p>
