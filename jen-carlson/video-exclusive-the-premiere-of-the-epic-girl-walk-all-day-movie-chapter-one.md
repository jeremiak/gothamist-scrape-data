<p>It&apos;s been <em>almost</em> one year since we first saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/12/video_staten_island_ferry.php">this girl dancing</a> around the Staten Island Ferry, which we later learned was part of an epic music video in progress set to the tune of Girl Talk. And now, we are so excited to be premiering the final product: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://girlwalkallday.com/watch-the-film">Girl Walk // All Day</a> (a production by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://www.wildcombination.com/">Wild Combination</a>), which was filmed all around New York City&#x2014;from Yankee Stadium, to the L train, to Central Park.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/11/video_girl_walkall_day_trailer.php">we mentioned</a> last month, we&apos;ll be exclusively releasing each chapter of the film right here, every Tuesday and Friday, until the finale in early January. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://girlwalkallday.tumblr.com/post/13468943092/when-we-launched-our-official-trailer-in-october#notes">Team GIrl Walk</a> explains:</p><blockquote>We thought long and hard about the best way to bring you our movie, because in reality, we want all of you to be in a big room with giant screens and loud speakers, watching and dancing together. The computer screen is hardly the best medium for this film. We considered how for many of you, it&#x2019;d be tough to watch the entire of a 75-minute long film in your chair at work,  or wherever you might encounter your first bit of Girl Walk // All Day. This is a film that (we hope) makes you want to tap your feet, stand up and grab your neighbor (or co-worker&#x2019;s) hand, and drop what you&#x2019;re doing and start dancing. By sharing our film in chapters on a website that&#x2019;s all about New York, we are giving you what we feel is the perfect amount of time to take from your lunch break to get a smile on your face.</blockquote>That said, we would not be opposed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">receiving some photos</a> of you guys dancing in your offices! And there is one place you can see the film in its entirety away from your computer screen, and that&apos;s at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://www.girlwalkallday.com/events/kickstarter-presents-girl-walk-all-day-nyc-premiere">the premiere</a> next Thursday, December 8th, at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple (317 Clermont Street, Fort Greene). Things will kick off with a visual light performance by the legendary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://www.joshualightshow.com/">Joshua Light Show</a>, followed by the screening, and then a dance party DJ&apos;ed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://www.mistersaturdaynight/">Mister Saturday Night</a> (Eamon Harkin and Justin Carter). Doors are at 9 p.m., and you must <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113211411/http://www.kickstarter.com/rsvp">RSVP here</a> to get in (and get there early, as it&apos;s first come first served).<p></p>
