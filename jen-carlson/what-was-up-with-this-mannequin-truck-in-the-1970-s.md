<p>Not long ago, Tom Riggle shared his collection of old photos with us, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131124083320/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/one_mans_photos_from_1960s_and_1970.php#photo-27">one of a truck</a> on the streets of 1970s New York City&#x2014;the truck had a brunette mannequin attached to the side of it. &quot;Only in New York!,&quot; etc. Today, Richard Dworkin sent over the above photo, which he took in SoHo in 1976, telling us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I too photographed the Speed wagon! Was here on the first tour I ever did.  We performed at the Cunningham studio in Westbeth, and at Environ and The Brook. We all stayed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131124083320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Rudner">Sarah Rudner</a>&apos;s loft at the west end of Canal Street.  I remember shooting this photo in SoHo... Apparently she had moved left to right or transmogrified by the spring of &apos;76.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Was it a tribute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131124083320/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/20/mannequin.php#photo-1">to Cynthia</a>? Commentary on the dangers of being a pedestrian on the city&apos;s car heavy streets? Was REO Speedwagon somehow involved? Was the driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131124083320/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/stuffed_animal_truck_is_the_work_of.php">Banksy&apos;s dad</a>?
