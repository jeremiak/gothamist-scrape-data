The late night talk show host is bringing his live act back to New York. TBS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142149/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/05/18/conan-obrien-new-york-chicago/">has announced</a> that O&apos;Brien will take the Beacon Theater stage from October 31st to November 3rd, all in celebration of his one year anniversary move to TBS (he&apos;ll also be swinging by Chicago in 2012). <p></p>

<p>The comedian was at the TBS upfronts yesterday (held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142149/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/05/fall-tv-season-technical-difficulties-slow-turner-broadcastings-upfront-presentation.html">at Hammerstein Ballroom</a>), and slammed his current employer, saying, &quot;I did this last year. I don&apos;t know why TBS can&apos;t do what they do best and run that again. Four freakin&apos; times.&quot; Ratings weren&apos;t as high as expected after he made his move to the network, but he did confirm, &quot;We are No. 1 in TBS&apos; key demo: people who cant afford HBO.&quot; He also joked that &quot;budgets are a little tighter&quot; at his new network, and that his accommodations during this trip were in The Bronx (joking, &quot;I forgot that was technically part of New York City&quot;).</p>

<p>Of course, NBC wasn&apos;t free from his jabs either, he commented on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142149/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/09/meredith_vieira_officially_quits_to.php">recent changes</a> at the <em>Today</em> show: &quot;Matt [Lauer] says, &apos;No, I&apos;m staying. i have a long term deal with NBC.&apos; All I have to say is welcome to TBS.&apos;&quot;</p>
