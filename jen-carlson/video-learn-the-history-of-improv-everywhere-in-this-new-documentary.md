<p>Charlie Todd and his ever-changing troupe of pranksters have now been immortalized on film. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173024/http://gothamist.com/tags/improveverywhere">Improv Everywhere</a> documentary&#x2014;called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173024/http://WeCauseScenes.com/">We Cause Scenes</a>&quot;&#x2014;was released yesterday online (available on iTunes and their own website), and captures Todd&apos;s vision and how it&apos;s grown over the years. Even the troupe&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173024/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/no_more_no_pants_subway_ride_please.php#photo-1">toughest critics</a> have to admit that Improv Everywhere makes the world a more fun place, right? Check out the trailer for the doc here:</p>

<p>Todd started working on Improv Everywhere in the summer of 2001 when he moved to New York, and while interest grew rapidly, a major moment came in 2008 when he managed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173024/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/01/video_of_the_da_159.php">to &quot;freeze&quot; Grand Central</a>. </p>

<p>Todd told us this afternoon that one of his favorite pranks is their very first, which involved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173024/http://improveverywhere.com/2001/08/03/ben-folds-last-night-in-town-part-two/">impersonating Ben Folds in a bar</a>. The prank was transcribed for the site, because this is four years before YouTube was even founded! The doc actually tells the story of how it transformed from a Geocities website to a YouTube channel&#x2014;Todd tells us &quot;the rise of the Internet is really the subplot. I was staging these projects for 5 years by the time YouTube was created.&quot;<br>
