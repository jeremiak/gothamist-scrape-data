<p>Usually around this time we&apos;re refreshing Banksy&apos;s website and Instagram to see where today&apos;s piece will be, but around 10 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135736/http://banksy.co.uk/">he posted</a>: &quot;Today&apos;s piece will be posted at 5 p.m.&quot; But what will it be? And is he working on it <em>right now</em>? If you see a tarp, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135736/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">let us know</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="banksy5pm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135736im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/banksy5pm.jpg" width="640" height="168" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Until then, we make wild speculations and theorize on what the piece will be. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135736/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/392775162535231488">In-house street art expert</a> Jake Dobkin says, &quot;My guess would be it&apos;s something that&#x2019;ll be unveiled, and is still being worked on, so probably something bigger than a regular stencil on a wall. Maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135736/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/is_this_an_unfinished_banksy_piece.php">that car we found in Red Hook</a>, or another big installation piece like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135736/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/is_this_an_unfinished_banksy_piece.php">the one on the LES</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Or maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135736/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">ol&apos; Bankster</a> just got snockered and slept in today.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 4:45 p.m.:</strong> Banksy has pushed his piece to 6 p.m. Earlier there were rumors about something happening at Elizabeth and Houston. When we checked out the area it was covered with a tarp, but you could easily see through&#x2014;we spotted a bumper car, a speaker, and lights: </p>
