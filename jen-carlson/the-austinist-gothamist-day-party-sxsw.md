<p>And what&apos;s a party without <b>gift bags</b>?! We&apos;ll have some of those to hand out too. Plus <b>extra spots</b> on the evening&apos;s afterparty guestlist that we&apos;ll be giving away to the <b>first 50 or so people</b> to show up.</p>

<p>Gothamist will have just flown in to Austin earlier that morning and we&apos;re totally up for the challenge we&apos;ve given ourselves of watching 14 bands 14 hours (10 bands at the day party, 4 at the afterparty). See you there (bring us caffeine)!</p>
