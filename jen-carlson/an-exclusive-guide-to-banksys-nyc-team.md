Another guy who has similar features showed up playing the role of Banksy to the 24th Street installation. It\'s unclear if this is really the same person, and if so, if he is officially part of Team Banksy, but there are some who believe so. As this video des\cription notes, when he approaches the paintings the guard doesn\'t even flinch, which could mean this was all pre-planned by the artist:\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\n\<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3OFIwGmYlcA?list=UURUwiehDoatMcnILKP7gDHQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\>\<\/iframe\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_21'] = photo;</script>
									
</div></div>					<p>We&apos;re more than halfway through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001856/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s month-long residency here on the streets of New York City, and it&apos;s time to check in with his crew (most of whom have probably never even directly dealt with the artist). While the elusive street artist may still be a mystery to most of the world, his inner circle and henchmen are standing right in front of us, a link to the man behind the curtain. Maybe there is safety in numbers, with each crew member muddying the waters and securing his secret identity. While here, he&apos;s already introduced a fascinating cast of characters, most of them integral parts of his pieces, others there to do some heavy lifting. Click through to see who we&apos;ve seen so far, we&apos;ll be updating throughout the month.  It is our dream that one day Wes Anderson will turn this all into a movie.</p>
