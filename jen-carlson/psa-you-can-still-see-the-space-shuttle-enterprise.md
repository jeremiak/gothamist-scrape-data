<p>The Space Shuttle Enterprise made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529112042/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/27/photos_the_space_shuttle_enterprise.php#photo-1">a grand entrance</a> into New York City, its new home, on Friday. But if you didn&apos;t get a chance to see it with your own eyes, it seems as though the Shuttle is still mated to the 747 it piggybacked here on, over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529112042/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/27/photos_the_space_shuttle_enterprise_1.php#photo-1">at JFK Airport</a>. And you can see it from the road! We&apos;re trying to find out how long it will be there for, and will update when we hear back.</p>

<p>In June, the Shuttle will be placed on a barge and brought over to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, where it will reside on the flight deck until it has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529112042/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/new_rendering_shows_space_shuttle_e.php">a more permanent structure</a> of its own.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&apos;re told the Shuttle &quot;will stay as is until mid-May.  It will then be detached from the jet and remain in the hangar until early June when it will be barged to Intrepid.&quot;</p>
