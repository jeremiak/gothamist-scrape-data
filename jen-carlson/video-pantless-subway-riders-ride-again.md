title: Video: Pantless Subway Riders Ride Again
---

	
										<p>In case the bazillion photos were not enough, there&apos;s finally some video documentation of this year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102031805/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/photos_video_no_pants_ride_2011.php">No Pants Subway Ride</a>! Just regular YouTube video, not 3-D, not IMAX, not Smell-O-Vision... and not once is there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102031805/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/video_rat_in_subway_car_crawls_over.php">a rat attack</a>. But maybe next year one of those elements can be added... because how many years in a row can one look at pantless subway riders?</p>
