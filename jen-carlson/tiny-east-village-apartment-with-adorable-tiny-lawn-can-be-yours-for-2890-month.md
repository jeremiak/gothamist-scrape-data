<p>New Yorkers may <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303142431/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/28/flashback_hating_on_suburbia.php">hate on Suburbia</a>, but we still love to incorporate charming suburban accoutrements into our urban landscape. And perhaps the most desired Thing of all is personal outdoor space. It is so desired that this tiny patch of fake grass in what looks like a DIY sandbox looks like a goddamn DREAM to us. It looks like Kensington Gardens. It&apos;s a giant sigh of relaxation <em>visualized</em>. Just looking at this pixelated photo makes us feel like we&apos;ve spent a week in a secluded and quiet and peaceful Connecticut backyard. Can you imagine, come spring, the great times you and your 2.5 friends will have in this teeny tiny paradise? And for only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303142431/http://www.ccrny.com/rentals/1008398">$2890/month</a> it could be yours, unless we get it first.
