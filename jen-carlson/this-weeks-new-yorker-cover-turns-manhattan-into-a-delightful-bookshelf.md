<p>I&apos;ve really been appreciating <em>The New Yorker</em> covers lately. They&apos;re like a little gift, arriving weekly, and while it may take you anywhere from two to fifty-two weeks to ultimately get through an issue, their covers deliver instant satisfaction. Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903045145/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/26/vladimir_putin_is_next_weeks_new_yorker_cover.php">political commentary</a>. Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903045145/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/new_yorker_liberty_cover.php">depression</a>. But, like, beautifully. Anyway, this week&apos;s cover, by Luci Guti&#xE9;rrez, is a simple, visual delight called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903045145/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-2017-03-27">Shelf Life</a>.&quot; It&apos;s very New York, and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903045145/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/hygge_guide.php">kinda hygge</a>, even if unintentionally so.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I drew a bookshelf, and the lines made me think of the streets of a map,&#x201D; Luci Guti&#xE9;rrez says, about her cover for this week&#x2019;s issue. Another inspiration for her image: Wunderkammern, the cabinets of curiosities created in the Renaissance to display collections of extraordinary objects. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have this particular piece of furniture, but I wish I did. I keep strange and pretty objects,&#x201D; Guti&#xE9;rrez says. &#x201C;It can be a chocolate paper wrapper or a Japanese mask... they provide me with a way to remember the place they come from.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Each shelf represents a neighborhood, with Central Park depicted by a large plant, Alphabet City by some blocks, and so on. Next to a stack of cash for the Financial District, the bottom shelf features a hole meant to represent the 9/11 memorial.</p>
