<p>The Alamo Drafthouse will be opening its first New York City theater inside of the historic Metro Theater at 2626 Broadway (between 99th and 100th street) next year, with plans to open theaters in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522000139/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/03/alamo_drafthouse_coming_to_brooklyn.php">Downtown Brooklyn</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522000139/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/02/alamo_drafthouse_coming_to_yonkers.php">Yonkers</a> (this year) as well.
