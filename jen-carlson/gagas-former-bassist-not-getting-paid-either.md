<p>Last week the superstar&apos;s former producer (<em>and lover</em>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520172658/http://gothamist.com/tags/robfusari">Rob Fusari</a> filed a lawsuit against her for $30 million, after he stopped receiving royalty checks. And now Gaga&apos;s former bassist, Tommy Kafafian&#x2014;who also co-wrote &quot;Disco Heaven&quot; from her album <em>The Fame</em>&#x2014;says he&apos;s still awaiting royalty checks as well. </p>

<p>However, perhaps scared off by the countersuit that Gaga hit Fusari with, he tells the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520172658/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/03/lady_gaga_rob_fusari_lawsuit.html">Star-Ledger</a> he has no plans to sue. Instead, he says, &quot;I&apos;m just gonna keep moving forward until Lady Gaga can&apos;t walk down the street without seeing my face or hearing my music.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520172658/http://www.myspace.com/dirtypollyanna">Help him out</a>?</p>
