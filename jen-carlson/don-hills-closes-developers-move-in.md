<p>On the last day of March owner and nightlife fixture <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022160154/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/nyers_remember_don_hill_his_debauch.php">Don Hill died</a> at the age of 66, leaving the future of his SoHo club, being run by Paul Sevigny and Nur Khan, uncertain. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022160154/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/music_over_at_don_hill_Lf55pR3hit9vYDWkxQZcKL?sms_ss=facebook&amp;at_xt=4db7f908c765ee6f%2C0">the NY Post</a>, on Monday the club closed its doors after a weekend of hosting A-list revelers for TriBeCa Film Festival after parties.</p>

<p>Alas, it seems as though that space has now been turned over to developers, and the paper notes that public records identify the current owners as Ponte Equities. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022160154/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2011/04/nightlife_shocker_don_hills_closes_after_8_months.php">Eater</a> claims the rent hadn&apos;t been paid, and the landlord changed the locks and informed the club owners the one-story building would be torn down.</p>

<p>Khan told the Post, &quot;[the property offered a] moneymaking opportunity unconcerned with preserving Don&apos;s legacy. I will be sad to see the doors close as it was such a passion project for me.&quot;</p>
