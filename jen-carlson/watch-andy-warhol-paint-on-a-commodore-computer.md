title: Watch Andy Warhol "Paint" On A Commodore Computer
---

	
										<p>In 1985, artist Andy Warhol created his first digital painting on an Amiga computer (the family of personal computers marketed by Commodore). See him work his magic on a portrait of Debbie Harry in the machine&apos;s &quot;paint system&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001432/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_Paint">Photon Paint</a>?) where he experiences a happy accident with a &quot;leaky flood fill.&quot; </p>

<p>In 2010 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001432/http://technologizer.com/2010/07/23/amiga/">Technologizer</a> revisited the cult computer 25 years later, noting that the above video was filmed at Lincoln Center&#x2014;&quot;Commodore was a famously parsimonious outfit, but it splurged on the Amiga&#x2019;s introduction. The highlight of that Lincoln Center product launch was a demo in which pop art legend Andy Warhol used an Amiga to &apos;paint&apos; Blondie&#x2019;s Debbie Harry. The exercise didn&#x2019;t prove much of anything other than that Warhol was able to use the paint program&#x2019;s fill command, but it was heady stuff.&quot;</p>
