</div></div>It&apos;s so lonely around here without the cold, inviting stare of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085359/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovi%C4%87">Marina Abramovi&#x107;</a>, isn&apos;t it? Luckily, last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085359/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/05/miranda_july.php">Miranda July</a>&apos;s public art project was unveiled in Union Square, and it&apos;s pretty fun! It&apos;s titled 11 Heavy Things, and consists of 11 sculptures that encourage viewer interaction. 

The installation will be set up through October, and July told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085359/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/34787/please-do-touch-a-qa-with-miranda-july">ArtInfo</a> that kids will probably use them as &quot;play equipment or something&quot; (which is probably safer than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085359/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/25/union_square_2.php">playground equipment</a> currently at the park!). If you head over there to interact with the pieces, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085359/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos or tag them with &quot;Gothamist&quot; in Flickr!
