<p>Bed-Stuy restaurant Do or Dine outraged some with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001225/http://gothamist.com/tags/foiegrasdoughnuts">Foie Gras Doughnuts</a> recently, but if the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001225/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/11/vegan_fried_kool-aid_comes_to_the_e.php">deep-fried vegan Kool-Aid balls</a> taught us anything, it&apos;s that vegans can (and will) recreate any food trend.</p>

<p>Enter: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001225/http://dunwelldoughnuts.com/faux-gras-the-thyme-is-now/">Dun Well Doughnuts</a>, who are filling up their herbed dough with Faux Gras, for a less cruel version of the delicacy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001225/http://www.thediscerningbrute.com/2011/08/27/faux-gras-filled-dunwell-doughnut/">the Discerning Brute</a>, who tried the vegan frankenfood, is certain &quot;even for the owners of Do or Dine would certainly admit that this thing is magnificent&quot;&#x2014;noting it&apos;s &quot;tender, airy dough speckled with herbs, slightly sweet, fried to perfection, and injected with the Regal Vegan&#x2019;s pat&#xE9; of caramelized onions, lentils, and walnuts.&quot;</p>

<p>The Dun Well folks aren&apos;t offering these up to the public just yet, but are sending some samples over to the office later this week for one of our  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001225/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/taste-testing_the_new_triple_double.php">signature taste tests</a> (Do or Dine folks, you are cordially invited to join us)... while we wait, feel free to wage bets on how many doughnuts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812001225/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/taste-testing_the_new_triple_double.php">Gothamist&apos;s Christopher Robbins</a> will be able to fit into his mouth at once.</p>
