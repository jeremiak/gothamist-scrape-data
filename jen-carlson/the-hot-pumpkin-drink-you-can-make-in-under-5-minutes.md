<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022220353/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/pumpkin_guts.php">Pumpkin Season</a>, but if the Pumpkin Spice Latte and its various orange chemicals aren&apos;t your thing, try this homemade hot pumpkin drink. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022220353/http://www.thehungrymouse.com/2013/10/24/harvest-pumpkin-steamer/">Jessie at the Hungry Mouse</a> says it&apos;s like hot chocolate, but with pumpkin instead of cocoa... and it only takes a few minutes to whip up a batch.  </p>

<p><strong>Harvest Pumpkin Steamer</strong> (courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022220353/http://www.thehungrymouse.com/">the Hungry Mouse</a>)<br>
</p><ul><li>2 cups whole milk<br>
</li><li>1/2 cup heavy cream<br>
</li><li>1/3 cup pureed pumpkin (NOT pumpkin pie filling)<br>
</li><li>1/4 cup sugar<br>
</li><li>1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (if you don&apos;t have any you can just make it out of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and clove)<br>
</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Bring all the ingredients together in a pot and simmer over medium-high heat, and you&apos;re done! You <em>can</em> add whipped cream but why do that when you can add rum?</p>
