<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/http://gothamist.com/tags/chinatownfair">Chinatown Fair</a> opened its doors on Mott Street in 1944, after original owner Sam Palmer, who had never been inside of an arcade before, had a &quot;religious vision.&quot; The Fair was packed with old arcade games, a tic-tac-toe playing chicken (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/http://www.upc-online.org/spring98/tic-tac-toe_chicken.html">retired in the late &apos;90s</a>), and a slew of patrons. &quot;It was a hangout for teenagers of all backgrounds, from homeless transgender kids to hardcore gamers,&quot; recalls Irene Chin, producer of the documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/https://vimeo.com/143555830"><em>The Lost Arcade</em></a>.</p>

<p>Decades ago, during its first incarnation, the arcade was featured in Old Dirty Bastard&apos;s video for &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCouTpY5S0">Brooklyn Zoo</a>,&quot; and Al Pacino even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqytFAGEjLY">talks about that chicken</a> in <em>Devil&apos;s Advocate</em>.</p>

<p>When it closed its doors a few years ago, many of the games were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/07/chinatown_fair_resurfaces_as_next_l.php">relocated to Sunset Park</a>, but they didn&apos;t seem to make it back to Mott Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/04/whoa_chinatown_fair_has_reopened.php">in 2012</a> when Chinatown Fair reopened. At the time, new manager Lonnie Sobel described the arcade as now being &quot;a cross between Dave &amp; Busters and Chuck E. Cheese.&quot; Indeed, it&apos;s not as good as the ol&apos; days, but Sobel&apos;s heart is in the right place, and he helped out after his grandkids begged him to step in.</p>

<p>As for the documentary, it focuses on a group of people whose lives were greatly impacted by the arcade, including Palmer himself. Director Kurt Vincent discussed how he began the project: &quot;I was never supposed to end up at Chinatown Fair&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not a gamer and never went to arcades growing up. I stumbled across Chinatown Fair late one February night in 2011. It was exciting, it was alive. I sensed that it was not an ordinary place. A few weeks after that visit, I heard a rumor Chinatown Fair was closing. I immediately began documenting the final moments of the arcade.&quot;</p>
