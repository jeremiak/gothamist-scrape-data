										<p>D.W. Young&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520040737/http://www.aholeinafence.com/"><em>A Hole in a Fence</em></a>, the documentary which focuses on Red Hook, has been floating around for a while and is coming back to town this week -- just before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520040737/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/13/ikea_red_hook_p.php">the new IKEA opens its doors</a> in the &apos;nabe. In 46 minutes Young explores the hurdles the neighborhood is facing and &quot;the complicated issues of development, class and identity facing the city&apos;s most populous borough.&quot; Young urban farmers and graffiti writers are followed as they watch their landscape disappear alongside their elder counterparts. </p>
