										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpSE90IxAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423053013im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpSE90IxAM.jpg" width="317" height="292" class="image-right"> </span>This deal almost seems too good to be true? Uber, the service we never use because we&apos;re scared of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423053013/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/04/uber.php">being charged $219</a> for a 7-mile ride, is offering free rides and basically free <em>everything</em> in Brooklyn this weekend. And the fine print doesn&apos;t even have any LOL JKs in it. Here&apos;s the deal...</p>

<p>This weekend you can take two free uberX rides to, from, or between neighborhoods in Brooklyn. They will cover $20 of this trip, and since uberX is their low cost option that&apos;s probably enough. To get the deal, enter the promo code BKLOVESuberX in the Uber app, select uberX, and feel what it&apos;s like to be a real Fat Cat taking an automobile ride through Kings County. </p>

<p>The deal is good for two rides, between noon on Friday and 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. But you guys: THAT&apos;S NOT ALL. You&apos;ll also get deals at various Brooklyn businesses and events&#x2014;like 2-for-1 New Orleans coffees at Blue Bottle, a free cocktail at Do or Dine, six free oysters when you buy one drink at OTB, a free Kelvin Boozy Slush at Pork Slope, a free cheese plate at the JakeWalk, and a lot of other things that have us planning a weekend bingefest. You can get the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423053013/http://blog.uber.com/bklovesuberX">complete list here</a>, and all you have to do is show your Uber receipt.</p>

<p>And then on Monday you&apos;ll wake up and take the subway with the rest of the commoners and it&apos;ll all fade away like a dream.</p>
