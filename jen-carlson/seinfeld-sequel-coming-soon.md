<p><img alt="200803seinfeld.jpg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200803seinfeld.jpg.jpg" width="240" height="290" class="left">After audiences shoo-ed off <em>Bee Movie</em>, Jerry Seinfeld is looking to create some buzz on the small screen again. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03072008/news/regionalnews/get_set_for_seinfeld_2_100828.htm">The NY Post</a> is reporting that &quot;the comedian will be playing himself in an exaggerated reality, in a show set in New York.&quot; Reportedly it will be a rip off of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, Larry David&apos;s HBO series (David co-created <em>Seinfeld</em>). </p>

<p>The series is said to be aiming for a June premiere, but what&apos;s in store? With <em>Seinfeld</em> ending a decade ago, the comedian (now in his mid-50s) will have to change what he&apos;s yada yada-ing about. He&apos;ll also be coming back to a post-9/11, and post-Giuliani, New York.</p>

<p>Will the new episodes focus on mysterious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/16/as_seen_on_tv_t.php">maple syrup smells</a>? An overabundance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/23/west_village_re.php">rats in restaurants</a>? A plagiarized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/08/seinfelds_face.php">cookbook scandal</a>? Will the germiphobe ban all bars and restaurants after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/25/socialista_trad.php">a hepatitis scare</a>?    One thing&apos;s for sure, he&apos;ll likely ditch his portable phone for a cell and an email account.</p>

<p>The show will be on NBC, so perhaps some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg9HD41B6gQ">30 Rock</a> crossovers are in order. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523180815/http://tv.hollyscoop.com/news/seinfeld-not-coming-to-a-tv-near-you_515.aspx">Curb your enthusiasm</a> Seinfeld fans, apparently this isn&apos;t happening (at least not yet). NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks says, &apos;&apos;There&apos;s nothing to it&quot; (though they would probably like there to be!). And Seinfeld&apos;s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Clark Zoia, also says the rumors are untrue, but, &apos;&apos;We appreciate the enthusiasm.&apos;&apos; </p>
