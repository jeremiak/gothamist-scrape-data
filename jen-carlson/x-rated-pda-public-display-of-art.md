In the process of hauling off the artwork the Parks Department deemed inappropriate, college officials managed to damange some of it. Two Trees Management (who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180201/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/05/30/galapagos.php">moving Galapagos to Dumbo</a>) saved the day and exhibited their show at 70 Washington Street. Meanwhile, the students sued the Parks Department, the city and Brooklyn College.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time the city has attacked art. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180201/http://www.artsjournal.com/issues/Brooklyn.htm">The Sensation show</a> at the Brooklyn Museum was a controversial one in 1999. Giuliani tried to stop it, and attempted to prevent taxpayer funds from subsidizing the museum. In the end a ceasefire was called, and the City of New York and the Brooklyn Museum signed an agreement which put an end to the clash.  </p>

<p>As far as the current case, the students charged city officials with censorship. Today the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180201/http://www.nysun.com/article/56021">NY Sun</a> reports that the city is backing down from the court battle - which would have tested its authority to ban offensive artwork in public spaces. Yesterday they apologized for shutting down the students show last year.  Not surprisingly, since Bloomberg is a big supporter of the arts, &quot;the Bloomberg administration is pursuing a more conciliatory path when accused of censorship than had the previous administration.&quot; </p>

<p>Each student (18 of them, and 1 teacher) will be paid $750 according to the Sun, however according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180201/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06072007/news/regionalnews/xxx_art_victory_regionalnews_stefanie_cohen.htm">The Post</a> - the payout is closer to $56K.</p>
