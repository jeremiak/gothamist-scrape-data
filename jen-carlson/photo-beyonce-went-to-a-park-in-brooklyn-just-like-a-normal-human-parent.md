<p>Two years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144503/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonc&#xE9;</a> (sans baby) went to Carroll Park in Brooklyn with her husband Jay-Z and their friends Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, just like they were normal non-famous people. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144503/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/really_famous_people_went_to_a_park.php">IT WAS F*CKING CRAZY YOU GUYS</a>. And now it&apos;s happened again. Yesterday the singer was spotted at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144503/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B111/">JJ Byrne Playground</a> (for those without kids, that is across from awesome drinking establishment The Gate) in Park Slope. According to Vibe, she was with her daughter Blue Ivy, and at one point <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144503/http://www.vibe.com/photo-gallery/beyonce-enjoys-sunday-park-blue-ivy-celebrates-kanyes-birthday/?page=2">she wore a balloon hat</a>. We will admit this <em>is</em> kind of crazy since Blue Ivy almost definitely has at least one personal playground hidden behind some secret locked gate in her own private sixth borough of New York. Right?</p>

<p>Anyway, word of The Event spread when NY Times op-ed columnist Charles M. Blow Tweeted about it&#x2014;his daughter had run in to the house after spotting the 31-year-old superstar doing average human stuff outside:  </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Daughter just came in the house breathless. Saw Beyonce and Blue Ivy in the kiddie park down the street. Daughter: &quot;Dad, what should I do?!&quot;</p>&#x2014; Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144503/https://twitter.com/CharlesMBlow/status/343790779690532864">June 9, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Beyonc&#xE9; is currently on a break before hitting the U.S. with her &quot;The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144503/http://parkslopestoop.com/blog/news/beyonce-spotted-swinging-blue-ivy-at-jj-byrne-playground-on-sunday">Park Slope Stoop</a>]</p>
