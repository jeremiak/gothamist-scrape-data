<p>Can we get a Facebook group going around this, akin to the one that got Betty White launched into the hosting spotlight on SNL? Because it would be amazing to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311035750/http://gothamist.com/tags/billmurray">Bill Murray</a> in something called &quot;Jurassic Park Slope&quot;&#x2014;a film which, yes, promises to combine both the Brooklyn neighborhood <em>and</em> dinosaurs. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311035750/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/williamsburg/?p=39745">Miss Heather</a> spotted this flyer at Urban Rustic in Williamsburg, we&apos;re hoping the people behind it also hit up Roebling Tea Room (where Murray&apos;s son is the chef), and just for good measure, some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311035750/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/08/bill_murray_slumming_it_at_brooklyn.php">Brooklyn house parties</a>.</p>
