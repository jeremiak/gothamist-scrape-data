										<p><strong>SHOPPING:</strong> Get ready to do some defensive shopping at the Barneys mega warehouse sale. It only comes twice a year, and this one runs til September 4th. So psych yourself up for some shoppin&apos; before all the good stuff is gone.</p>

<p><em>10am to 8pm // Barneys Co-Op [236 West 18th St] </em></p>

<p><strong>MOVIE:</strong> Tonight&apos;s outdoor movie? The Warriors! Part of this summers Brooklyn Bridge Park &quot;Movies With a View&quot; series. Nothing fits a good &apos;ol New York City gang war story like fresh air and popcorn. </p>

<p><em>8pm // Brooklyn Bridge Park [1 Main St, DUMBO] // Free</em></p>

</p><p><strong>MUSIC:</strong> Tonight we&apos;ve got a tough decision to make. Over at Sin-e it&apos;s New York&apos;s favorite Atlanta band, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://www.myspace.com/snowden">Snowden</a>. They just got a great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/37378/Snowden_AntiAnti">review on Pitchfork</a> for their album that came out Tuesday, <em>Anti-Anti</em>. </p>

<p>Listen: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://media.jadetree.com/Snowden-Anti-Anti.mp3">Anti-Anti.mp3</a> - Snowden</p>

<p>On the bill with them is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://www.papercranesmusic.com/">Papercranes</a>, led by Joaquin Phoenix&apos;s sister .</p>

<p>Then over at the Annex tonight there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://myspace.com/slowlands">Slowlands</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://myspace.com/tokyopoliceclub">Tokyo Police Club</a> prior to (during?) the weekly Stolen Transmission party. Fuel up on free Sparks from 9 to 10. </p>

<p>Maybe we can catch all three if we try real hard. (Disclaimer: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://5thfloor.org/">we</a>&quot; manage Slowlands.)</p>

<p><em>10pm Papercranes, 11pm Snowden // Sin-e [150 Attorney St] // $10<br>
11pm Slowlands, 12 Tokyo Police Club // The Annex // $6</em></p>

<p>We do know where to start things off though, G Love at Summerstage! Prior to him you&apos;ll see a handful of up and comers, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175323/http://myspace.com/johnpringle">John Pringle</a>, play for about 12 minutes each. This is part of the Jeep UnCharted Tour.</p>

<p><em>6:30pm // Summerstage, Central Park // Free</em></p>
