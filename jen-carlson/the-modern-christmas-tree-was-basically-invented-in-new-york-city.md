<p>Since Santa is a local, coming straight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145914/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/did_you_know_santas_a_new_yorker.php">from Chelsea</a>, it only makes sense that New York also has its stamp on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145914/http://gothamist.com/tags/christmastree">the Christmas Tree</a>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145914/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/the-new-yorkers-who-invented-the-christmas-tree/">Ephemeral NY</a>, the electric-lit tree was invented right here by Thomas Edison VP Edward Johnson. According to lore:</p>

<blockquote>Before about 1900, trees were lit with wax candles&#x2014;a dangerous tradition that caused deadly house fires every season. But in 1882, Edward Johnson, a VP for Thomas Edison, came up with an idea: He put a string of 80 twinkling electric lights&#x2014;colored red, white, and blue with crepe paper&#x2014;around his own Christmas tree in his Fifth Avenue home. His electric lights attracted media attention and became a sensation among the wealthy.</blockquote>

<p>Many were still using candles, however, until Albert Sadacca, a teenager whose family owned a lighting company, suggested that they manufacture colored strings of light for trees, which eventually caught on in 1920. The electric lights can be dangerous too, however, especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145914/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/02/christmas_trees_and_your_pet.php">for cats</a>...</p>
