For some inexplicable reason (perhaps to become the next big viral video star), New Yorker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321021443/http://myspace.com/mark_malkoff">Mark Malkoff</a> decided to hit them all up in just one day. </p>

<p>On June 29th at 5:30am Malkoff makes his first of many purchases at 181st and Washington Heights, then for over twelve hours he travels by bike from store to store until a friend with a car decides to help him out. His caffeine-fueled journey ends at 60th and Broadway at 2:56am, we can&apos;t imagine he got much sleep for the next few days. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321021443/http://www.171starbucks.com/">Watch his video here</a>. </p>

<p>Just how much did Starbucks shake out of his pockets in just over 20 hours? The grand total came to $369.14. This figure would have been less if a barista at 96th and Madison didn&apos;t accept an $80 bribe for a piece of pound cake after hours...and if he also didn&apos;t make accidental repeat visits to six of the same Starbucks. </p>
