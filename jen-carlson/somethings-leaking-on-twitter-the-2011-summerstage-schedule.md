										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="summerstage032211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209223259im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/summerstage032211.jpg" width="365" height="352"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209223259/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffrysg/30517581/">JeffrySG&apos;s flickr</a></span></i></div> Today it was announced that the City Parks Foundation would announce a portion of its upcoming 26th SummerStage season through, <em>of course</em>, Twitter. This wil all begin on April 1st, at which point one performance will be announced each day for twenty days. By the end, the full season will be public, which will include over 300 artists at over 100 performances in all five boroughs. <p></p>

<p>The Foundation&apos;s David Rivel says, &#x201C;We want to engage with our fan base in a way that is unique, immediate, and allows fans to connect with one another as well as the performers themselves.&#x201D; They&apos;ll also be offering some prizes via their Twitter feed, and it looks like some shows have already been announced (Lykke Li will perform on August 1st, and tickets are already on sale). You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209223259/http://twitter.com/#!/SummerStage">follow along here</a> for further updates, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209223259/http://www.facebook.com/centralparksummerstage">&quot;like&quot; them on Facebook</a>&#x2014;pick your social networking poison!<br>
