The 500-lb number &quot;8&quot; will complete the &quot;2008&quot; sign that will be a part of the midnight festivities.</p>

<p>Standing at 7 feet tall, the &quot;8&quot; and it&apos;s three other numerical companions will be on display through the 19th at the Times Square information center. Just like its other holiday luminaries in the city, the bulbs used this year are more energy efficient than ever before. </p>

<p>What trains did the &quot;8&quot; swipe its Metrocard at? It took the 6 to the N/R this morning -- which hopefully brightened up some people&apos;s commutes. </p>
