										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_11_sadpanda2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507142038im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_11_sadpanda2.jpg" width="200" height="164" class="image-left"> </span>Be warned: this video of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507142038/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadpanda">Sad Panda</a> will melt even the coldest of hearts. The fact is that Sad Panda (sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507142038/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/sad_panda_is_spongebob_squarepants.php">Spongebob Squarepants</a>) is actually pretty sad, and that makes us Sad Humans. </p>

<p>Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism student Michelle Tay has sent us this exclusive interview with the man behind the mask. The audio is in Mandarin, but there are subtitles that tell the 62-year-old Jialing Chen&apos;s story &#x2014; which includes a hard luck tale of being forced to leave his former restaurant job. Unable to find work again, he started out his journey as Sad Panda, where on a good day he&apos;ll make 30 bucks. His wife works 7 days a week as a private nurse, so the family can afford health care. Yeah, get out the tissues...</p>

<p>Just think about how many more sad stories are hidden behind masks out there.</p>
