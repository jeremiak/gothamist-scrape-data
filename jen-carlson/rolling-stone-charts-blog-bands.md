Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005011908/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5023133">as NPR charted</a> the rise of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah through blogs, Rolling Stone has now done the same with them and other bands. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005011908/http://www.stereogum.com/archives/003626.html">Stereogum posted</a> their chart (above) which not so accurately depicts how blogs destroy bands that they love. Apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005011908/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/06/15/the_gothamist_band_interview_clap_your_hands_say_yeah.php">on June 15th</a>, 2005 we said something nice about CYHSY - and in this chart that is (one of) their high points?! Not to metion Pitchfork is charted as their low point. We&apos;re guessing some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005011908/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/06/17/rolling_stone_r.php">Rolling Stone intern</a> didn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005011908/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16518/Clap_Your_Hands_Say_Yeah_Clap_Your_Hands_Say_Yeah">do their research</a>.

</p><p>Moving on, there are four bands used in this &quot;scientific study&quot;: Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Tapes n&apos; Tapes, Arctic Monkeys and Cold War Kids. </p>

<p>Our two cents: CYHSY are the only ones with any staying power, and they haven&apos;t received <em>that</em> much backlash. They&apos;re a talented band that will transcend this blog buzz thing. The rest of them have fallen victim to bloggers trying really hard to find &quot;the next big thing&quot; and over hyping something that probably sounded alright on the first listen. Tapes n&apos; Tapes are not very good, we can&apos;t see them being around for more than a couple of years (if that), and aside from that dancefloor song we still haven&apos;t really listened to Arctic Monkeys or Cold War Kids (but according to this chart they are <em>so over</em> anyway). </p>

<p>Also, they forgot to mention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005011908/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/08/12/how_to_get_an_8.php">Clell Tickle</a>. </p>
