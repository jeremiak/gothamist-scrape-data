<p>The Brooklyn Heights Cinema is a no frills, not-of-this-time, two screen theater on Henry Street. Within the white brick establishment you&apos;ll find a humble snack counter with an aging popcorn machine, and a couple of good pictures rotating in on the screens every month or so. Outside, they often personalize messages on the marquee (recent ones have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102403/http://instagram.com/p/gF6UzDvYdQ/">invited Banksy</a> to paint their walls, and offered Bill Murray free tickets). It is the perfect date theater, the perfect place to see a movie alone, it has been there since 1970, it &quot;is the oldest and longest running independently owned and operated cinema remaining in New York City,&quot; and it would be a goddamn travesty if it shut down. So let&apos;s save it?</p>

<p>Recently the building went up for sale for $7.5 million, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102403/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140221/brooklyn-heights/brooklyn-heights-cinemas-historic-building-listed-for-75m">according to DNAInfo</a> &quot;is alternatively offering it for lease at $30,000 per month.&quot; Though they add, &quot;landlord Thomas Caruana supports having Brooklyn Heights Cinema stay in the building, [owner Kenn] Lowy said its future is far from assured.&quot;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102403/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/65757">an open letter</a>, Lowy said &quot;the landlord has become increasingly frustrated because he cannot get his planned development approved by the city&#x2019;s Landmark Preservation Commission. This is a plan that we wholeheartedly support. The plan includes the cinema.&quot; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102403/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2014/02/breaking-brooklyn-heights-cinema-building-is-for-sale-or-lease/">Brownstoner</a>, the plan would be to build a 10,000-square-foot residential building, which would house the cinema on the ground floor&#x2014;the renderings are part of the real estate listing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102403/http://www.masseyknakal.com/downloads/70_Henry_Street_-_Set-Up.pdf">which you can see here</a>. Previous attempts to level the landmarked building&#x2014;built in 1895&#x2014;have failed. The landlord says Lowy&#x2014;who is on a month-to-month lease&#x2014;can &quot;stay until he is ready to move forward.&quot; Lowy is currently trying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102403/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-save-the-brooklyn-heights-cinema">to raise funds</a> for digital projectors, which he believes will help save the cinema:</p>
