<p>The scene-stealing Megan Draper (aka Jessica Par&#xE9;) was all the talk at the <em>Mad Men</em> water cooler following the premiere of the show&apos;s 5th season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235123/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/25/mad_men_8.php">on Sunday</a>. Her rendition of &#x201C;Zou Bisou Bisou&#x201D; (seen below) at Don&apos;s surprise birthday party garnered so much press that, naturally, someone is seeking to profit from her performance. Today it was announced that the song, which translates to &#x201C;Oh You, Kiss, Kiss,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235123/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/mad-men-season-premiere-yields-a-musical-single/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">will now be released</a> on iTunes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235123/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/zou-bisou-bisou-single/id510723045">get it here for $1.29</a>), Amazon, and in retail stores by Lionsgate, the studio that produces <em>Mad Men</em>, who will also release a limited-edition vinyl via AMC&#x2019;s website. At press time there&apos;s no word of the studio creating a Megan hologram performing the song so you can relive the experience as Don himself.</p>
