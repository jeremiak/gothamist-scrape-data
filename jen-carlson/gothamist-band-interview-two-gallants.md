We didn&apos;t know any of their songs, yet stood mesmerized by their almost frantic set. They played music that was reminiscent of a time none of us lived in, music for a pre-Beat wandering traveler. Raw, human and refreshing - the raspy voice and pounding drum beats, oft bittersweet lyrics and perfectly rough-edged songcrafting has made this band stand above the rest for us. </p>

<p>Come check out the railroad rock this Monday (April 24th) for yourself, Two Gallants will be headlining Bowery Ballroom. Listen: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132012/http://toolshedmedia04.com/ts/two-gallants-las-cruces-jail.mp3">Las Cruces Jail.mp3</a></p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate? Could you also pronounce it for us so we stop saying it the wrong way, is it two gall&#x201D;aunts&#x201D; or two gall&#x201D;ants&#x201D;?  </strong></p>

<p>The name that we embody, originally was born as the name of the third short story/chapter in the book <em>Dubliners</em>, by James Joyce. It is technically accepted to pronounce the word &#x201C;gallants&#x201D; in either form you suggested&#x2026;but we prefer the former.</p>

<p><strong>How does the San Francisco music scene differ from New York&#x2019;s?</strong><br>
San Francisco is a town pregnant with art and music,  especially now,  there is a lot of original, local, music echoing through the streets, hallways, venues, basements,  rooms throughout SF&#x2026;  but I do not feel that there is a cohesiveness;  there is so much music,  but there lacks a cohesive &#x201C;scene&#x201D;&#x2026;there is no defining SF sound. </p>

<p>That being said, firstly, I cannot pretend to know very much about the music scene in New York; but, from the idea of the musicians perspective living in New York,  I would imagine that one might feel more pressure to make music in a certain way because of what New York stands for musically. In SF,  I don&#x2019;t believe there are as many superficial pressures&#x2026; there is not very much big music business there to affect things.</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of New York?</strong><br>
When I was 17, and thinking of my life, I gathered the courage to visit SVA,  and though I had visited NYC a few times in my youth,  it wasn&#x2019;t until being led by a docent through the schools different campuses in Manhatten that I realized, and felt,  the weight,  and focused chaos and humanity, of history, present, and future that the humid air entwined with its every slippery in-breathe. </p>

<p><strong>Favorite city you&#x2019;ve played? </strong><br>
Every city has such a unique dynamic&#x2026;. but Rapid City,  South Dakota, stands as an important place in our collective heart.</p>
