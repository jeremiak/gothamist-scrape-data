Well there&apos;s no turning back now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161712/http://thevirtualdimemuseum.blogspot.com/2010/01/lost-and-found-in-victorian-brooklyn.html">The Virtual Dime Museum</a> takes a look at some odd listings printed in the Lost and Found column of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle back in the 19th century, and they&apos;re kind of peculiar! The listings include a $25 reward for a &quot;gray squirrel&quot; (with its cage!), a white goat lost on Van Brunt Street, and some valuable mysterious papers that the owner does not want out there circulating! How much do you suppose $25 was in 1867... because that seems like an awful lot to pay for the return of a common gray squirrel.</p>
