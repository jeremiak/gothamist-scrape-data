<p>It&apos;s been a while since we talked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922044430/http://gothamist.com/tags/mileycyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>. Did you know she has a <em>Movement</em> now? We&apos;re all a part of it, too! Us, you, Britney Spears, this kitten:</p>

<p>A lot of things about this Movement and how it effects us all is a little unclear, but things will be further revealed on October 2nd at 10 p.m. EST, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922044430/http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/957379/miley-the-movement-trailer.jhtml#id=1713769">MTV debuts</a> their one-hour long special titled <em>Miley: The Movement</em>. In this Miley is heard declaring: &quot;There&apos;s an army, we&apos;re all part of The Movement.&quot; Presumably during this viewing is when we&apos;ll receive our orders as civilians under this new regime... you should probably learn about twerking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922044430/http://www.tmz.com/2013/07/22/miley-cyrus-ecstasy-mdma-molly-we-cant-stop/">and MDMA</a> before then so you get a higher ranking position in the army. </p>

<p>A few days after this she&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922044430/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/09/tina_fey_will_host_snls_39th_season.php">on SNL</a> as musical guest and host&#x2014;which will also be mandatory viewing for anyone that&apos;s a part of The Movement (all of us). Following all of this, anyone part of The Movement (all of us) will then be subjected to countless articles written about her &quot;controversial&quot; whatever-thing-she-did-this-time. Some circles believe this era will be known in history as our official entrance into Idiocracy.</p>
