<p>Any New Yorker... <em>anyone who has even been to New York</em>... feels some anger, sadness, and pain over the loss of the great old Pennsylvania Station. The cavernous train terminal was grand and romantic, and we typically see it through the same black &amp; white photos that circulate any time someone wants to take a painstaking look back at the majesty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228022327/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/31/penn_station_1.php">we destroyed</a>. But we rarely get to see video footage of the place when it was open to the public. Now, on February 18th (at 9 p.m.), PBS will air an hour long special&#x2014;called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228022327/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/penn/">The Rise and Fall of Penn Station</a>&quot;&#x2014;which features just that. Watch a clip below, and let the tears flow as you dread your upcoming visit to the current Penn Station.</p>
