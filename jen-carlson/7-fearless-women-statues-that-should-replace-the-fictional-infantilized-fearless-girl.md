title: 7 Fearless Women Statues That Should Replace The Fictional, Infantilized 'Fearless Girl'
---

	
										<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170908112919/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/more_female_statues_in_nyc_please.php">five historical female statues</a> in New York City. Men? They have about 150. Recently there has been a big push for more female statues depicting real women, and not, say, fictional statues like Alice in Wonderland or some nameless muse. Yet in the latest addition of the temporary statue &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170908112919/http://gothamist.com/tags/fearlessgirl">Fearless Girl</a>,&quot; we get yet another fictional, infantilized female statue&#x2014;this one put there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170908112919/https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/fearless-girl-wall-street/519393/">by a global corporation</a> with a gender diversity problem. It&apos;s been a fairly divisive installation, with some rejecting it, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170908112919/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/blaz_bullish_on_fearless_girl.php">others hoping to keep it</a> as a permanent piece of the city&apos;s landscape. But what about the real, deserving women who have paved the way as fearless leaders in their respective fields, where are their statues? Here&apos;s a short list (by no means comprehensive) of women who deserve their own permanent place in this city.</p>

At Sachs\'s Cafe, a gathering place for radicals, she was introduced to Alexander Berkman, an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening. They went to hear Johann Most, editor of a radical publication called Freiheit and an advocate of \"propaganda of the deed\" - the use of violence to instigate change. She was impressed by his fiery oration, and he took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking.\<\/blockquote\> \r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nAfter that, Goldman declared, \"I began to speak.\"\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nGoldman, who then became \"known for her political activism, writing, and speeches,\" took residence in a tenement at 208 East 13th (there is a plaque dedicated to her there), according to \<a href=\"http://gvshp.org/blog/2011/11/29/east-village-tenement-housed-the-most-dangerous-woman-in-america/\"\>Off The Grid\<\/a\>. They note that she supported \"a wide-range of controversial causes, including free speech, birth control, womenâs equality, union organization, and workersâ rights.\" And that, in part, is why \"she was considered, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, one of the most dangerous women in the country.\" \r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nDuring the Panic of 1893, on August 21, Goldman addressed thousands in Union Square, encouraging \"unemployed workers to take immediate action [rather than depend on charity or government aid].\" An undercover cop allegedly heard her say \"take everything ... by force,\" but Goldman later recounted what she said: \"Demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread.\" Still, she was charged with \"\<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman#.22Inciting_to_riot.22\"\>inciting to riot\<\/a\>.\" When Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered to drop charges if she named other radicals, she threw a glass of water in his face. During this time, Nellie Bly (another woman who deserves a statue!) spoke to Goldman for the New York World, where she published a story calling her the \"modern Joan of Arc.\" Later, Goldman did end up serving a couple of years in prison \"after founding the No-Cons\cription League in protest against the draft.\" She was deported after her release in 1919, during the \"Red Scare,\" but she \<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman#Deportation\"\>didn\'t go without a fight\<\/a\>:\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\n\<blockquote\>At her deportation hearing on October 27, Goldman refused to answer questions about her beliefs on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: \"Today so-called aliens are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished. Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled.\"\<\/blockquote\>\r\n\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\n\<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman#Death\"\>Goldman died in Canada\<\/a\> at age 70, and at that time \"the US Immigration and Naturalization Service allowed her body to be brought back to the United States. She was buried in German Waldheim Cemetery (now named Forest Home Cemetery) in Forest Park, Illinois, among the graves of other labor and social activists including Ben Reitman and those executed after the Haymarket affair,\" an event that she considered a pivotal moment that sparked her political radicalization.
