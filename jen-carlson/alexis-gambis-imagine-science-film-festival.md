Naturally, he went on to study both film and science in college, and eventualy started a lecture series at The Rockefeller University called &quot;Science and Media&quot;. He&apos;s also part of the Secret Science Club, and now, he brings the first Science Film Festival to New York! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107070343/http://www.imaginesciencefilms.com/festival-2/">Imagine Science Film Festival</a> kicks off on Thursday, and runs through the 25th.</em> <br>

<strong>How did you come up with the idea for the Imagine Science Film Festival?</strong> I strongly believe that the best way to communicate science is by wrapping science into stories. While documentaries are wonderful, I think science + documentary = not always a great mix and can lead to fact overload and not so comprehensible, interesting, exciting films. On the other extreme, there are also issues with science &quot;fiction&quot;. Far  too often, science fiction is not grounded on &quot;credible&quot; scientific facts; flicks of the sort affect both public understanding and perception on very important scientific issues such as stem cell research, etc. Army of clones who destroy the world. Not so great for pushing for more stem cell research.</p>

<p>There is some good science fiction out there though but in general &quot;you do not have to distort science to make it exciting&quot;. Science is everywhere, it is part of our everyday lives and activities. The NY Imagine Science Film Festival started with the Rockefeller Film Series screenings and my work with the Secret Science Club. I started showing science films to the Rockefeller community and also my shorts at Union Hall.</p>

<p>This led to the idea about 8-months ago to expand and start a full-fledge NY science film festival. Also, it was appealing to start this in New York being the focal site for both science research and independent filmmaking. Suprisingly, no science film festival existed in New York existed before Imagine Science. </p>
