<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="BLUEIVY0112A.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703143110im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/BLUEIVY0112A.jpeg" width="350" height="240" class="image-right"> </span>This weekend we learned two wildly famous and wealthy people used their power and money for good. Just kidding! Beyonc&#xE9; and Jay-Z used their fame and fortune to rent out an entire floor of Lenox Hill Hospital, inconveniencing others that also needed access to loved ones and medical attention. The couple were there for the birth of their child, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703143110/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/08/beyonce.php">Blue Ivy</a>, and closed off the 4th (VIP pad) and 6th (delivery suite) floors, depending on where Team Carter was at the time. Problem is: they also closed access off to parents who needed to see their own babies in the neonatal intensive-care unit.</p>

<p>New dad Neil Coulin spoke out about the inconvenience <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703143110/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/08/extra_extra_happy_birthday_david_bo.php">this weekend</a>, saying he was unable to see his premature, newborn twins. He told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703143110/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/blue-beyonce-special-treatment-bed-stuy-dad-jay-z-turned-lenox-hill-private-club-article-1.1002985#ixzz1izPpcgnR">the Daily News</a>, &#x201C;This is the NICU. Nobody cares if you&#x2019;re a celebrity. Nobody is star-gazing. They just want to see their children. To have that circus roll into town and ruin our parade was unpleasant.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703143110/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/beyonce_hospital_mates_baby_bumped_YyFVyNbtrcBeOfhkT8QgiN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">The NY Post</a>, who have already dubbed Blue Ivy a &quot;diva,&quot; has more details on the couple&apos;s extravagant stay at Lenox Hill. The customization of &quot;their&quot; floor took two months, with bulletproof doors installed, window glass tinted, and curtains put up so no one could catch a glimpse of the royalty walking about the floor if they managed to make it past the security detail. The Post also notes that, &quot;Last night, at least four security guards stood watch at the hospital&#x2019;s fourth-floor elevator bank, where new parents and grandparents were still voicing their frustrations over security measures that delayed or completely prevented them from visiting.&quot;</p>

<p>But let&apos;s talk about THAT NAME, right? It turns out that Blue Ivy Carter was named for her dad&#x2019;s album, <em>Blueprint</em>, &quot;and her mom&#x2019;s favorite number, 4&#x2014;represented by the Roman numeral IV, or Ivy.&#x201D; And look at that, pops has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703143110/http://lifeandtimes.com/glory-feat-b-i-c">already recorded a song for her</a>&#x2014;because they probably installed a recording studio in one of the commoners&apos; rooms in the hospital.</p>
