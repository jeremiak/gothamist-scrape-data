<p>Today a publicist for powerHouse Books, an independent DUMBO bookstore and publisher of art and photography books, sent over these graphics, pointing out their book covers in last night&apos;s <em>Girls</em> episode. The shots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041635/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/14/on_location_with_girls_spoonbill_su.php">inside of Williamsburg&apos;s Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown bookstore</a> feature books published by powerHouse, and we&apos;re told the show&apos;s &quot;props coordinator specifically reached out&quot; to them for their help. A call to Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown confirmed that most of these books aren&apos;t usually carried by the store, and that the <em>Girls</em> crew brought them in. So if you ever wondered how many Brooklyn-based bookstores it takes to create a one minute make-out scene inside of a bookstore on <em>Girls</em>, the answer is confusingly: two.</p>

<p>While this type of fastidious set design and prop-sourcing is typical in show biz, we have to wonder if the book titles were specifically chosen because <em>they mean something</em>. Who wants to bet the season finale features Hannah wearing blue jeans while tripping on acid in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she hallucinates an encounter with spirits and ghosts, ultimately getting arrested for tresspassing and sent to prison, where she renews her abiding faith, love and hope for herself behind bars?</p>
