										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_hipgrif.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101827im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_hipgrif.jpg" width="140" height="156" class="image-left"> </span>As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101827/http://gothamist.com/tags/hipstergrifter">Hipster Grifter</a>, Kari Ferrell, sits behind bars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101827/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/10/love-forever-the-hipster-grifter/">penning notes</a> to NYC bloggers, her story hit the small screen in an episode of Law &amp; Order. The episode, which aired last Friday, featured a girl named Emma with lots of similarities to our lil&apos; Korean Abdul-Jabbar. </p>

<p>&quot;Emma&quot; worked at a music magazine called Jam (in real life Ferrell worked at Vice); she has a chronic kidney disease, anemia, a liver disease <em>and</em> a heart condition (in real life, she claimed to have cancer); she had warrants out for her arrest in numerous cities (check!); and in one scene there&apos;s a romantic segue to her being in bed with a guy, to the guy buying a hot dog (to throw down her hallway?). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101827/http://cerealcommas.com/blog/?p=589">See a clip from the show here</a> (and even though it&apos;s got &quot;Emma&quot; on the stand being questioned by Executive ADA Michael Cutter, she still manages to grab her crotch in tears and say, &quot;You want this&quot;). Now, does this mean the book can officially be closed on the Grifter?</p>
