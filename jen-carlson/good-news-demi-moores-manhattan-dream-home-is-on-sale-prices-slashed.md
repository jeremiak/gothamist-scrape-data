<p>When Demi Moore&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035952/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/17/demi_moore_is_selling_her_central_p.php">San Remo triplex overlooking Central Park</a> went on the market for $75 million, we passed. It&apos;s a beautiful piece of historic New York City real estate, sure, but ultimately we decided that it would cause too much pain in the end. And the end <em>will</em> come&#x2014;at some point we will die, and when that time comes, wouldn&apos;t life be easier to let go of if it wasn&apos;t so perfect and beautiful? </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear why others have passed (on purchasing), but the penthouse is still on the market, and Moore just slashed the price. Crushed it like a clay vase on a potter&apos;s wheel. Decided to make a <em>decent</em> proposal. And so on...</p>

When she put the home on the market, she told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035952/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/realestate/demi-moores-san-remo-penthouse-for-sale.html">the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;This apartment is too magnificent not to be lived in full time,&quot; so any potential buyer should know that this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035952/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/03/always_buy_a_burner_apartment.php">the only home you need</a>.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035952/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/6/16/11952776/demi-moore-san-remo-penthouse-for-sale-nyc">Curbed</a> points out that the highest price a place at the San Remo has ever sold for is $26.4 million, it&apos;s worth noting that Moore&apos;s apartment is unique. The penthouse is located in one of two towers atop the building&#x2014;it&apos;s in the South Tower, while the penthouse in the North Tower is owned by Bono. You could construct a tin can telephone and he can sing you &quot;With Or Without You&quot; on nights that you are feeling a little sad.</p>
