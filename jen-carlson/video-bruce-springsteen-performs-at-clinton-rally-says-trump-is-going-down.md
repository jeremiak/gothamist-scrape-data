<p>At Hillary Clinton&apos;s final rally before Election Day&#x2014;held in Philadelphia on Monday night&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626132502/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-bruce-springsteen-perform-rip-trump-at-clinton-rally-w449082">Bruce Springsteen turned up</a> to perform a three-song set of classics, including &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; &quot;Dancing in the Dark,&quot; &quot;Long Walk Home,&quot; and &quot;The Trump Campaign Is Going Down (Tomorrow).&quot; Okay, that last one is new. </p>

<p>It&apos;s an enjoyable, soothing twenty minutes, and it&apos;s just what this nation needs to take away the anxiety on Election Day Eve. </p>

<p>Here is Springsteen&apos;s full speech:</p><blockquote>The choice tomorrow couldn&#x2019;t be any clearer. Hillary&#x2019;s candidacy is based on intelligence, experience, preparation and of an actual vision of America where everyone counts. Men and women, white and black, Hispanic and native. Where folks of all faiths and backgrounds can come together to address our problems in a reasonable and thoughtful way. That vision of America is essential to sustain, no matter how difficult its realization. Hillary sees an America where income distribution should be a the forefront of our national conversation. Where the progress we&apos;ve made in reducing unemployment is not enough&#x2014;we must do better. She has a vision of universal health care for all that will build on the work of President Obama. She sees an America that needs to be fairer, where our highest courts look to protect all of our citizens, not just the privileged. She sees an America where the issue of immigration reform is dealt with realistically and passionately. And she calls on America to participate on the welfare of our planet... and where the unfinished business of protecting the rights of women is not an afterthought but a priority. This is a country where will we indeed be stronger together.</blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote>Now briefly to address her opponent, this is a man whose vision is limited to little beyond himself, who has the profound lack of decency that would allow him to prioritize his own interests and ego before American democracy itself. Somebody who would be willing to damage our long-cherished and admired system rather than look to himself for the reasons behind his own epic failure. And that&apos;s unforgivable. Tomorrow, those ideas and that campaign is going down. Let&apos;s all do our part so we can look back on 2016 and say we stood with Hillary Clinton on the right side of history. That&apos;s why I&apos;m standing here with you tonight, for the dream of a better America.</blockquote>
