<p>At some point during the chaos over the past week or so, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104223104/http://gothamist.com/tags/starbucks">Starbucks</a> ditched their fall flavored coffee drinks for their holiday line-up: the Caramel Brulee Latte, the Eggnog Latte, and the most delicious of all, the Peppermint Mocha. The problem is, these drinks can pack up to 640 calories a pop. But did you know you can make yours a &quot;skinny&quot;? Sure, you&apos;ll run the risk of sounding like &quot;that guy&quot; when you order, but you can shave off <em>hundreds of calories</em> if you do it. Let&apos;s use the Peppermint Mocha as our example&#x2014;a venti (with whole milk and whipped cream) is 540 calories:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ventimocha1112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104223104im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ventimocha1112.jpeg" width="640" height="294" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>A venti &quot;skinny&quot; without whipped cream (do you really need whipped cream on such a rich drink?) is 170 calories:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="skinnymocha1112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104223104im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/skinnymocha1112.jpeg" width="640" height="303" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>That&apos;s a 370 calorie savings! And we tried one this morning and didn&apos;t even notice a difference in taste. Of course, you can always just stick a candy cane in your regular coffee and bring that count down to about 20 calories.</p>
