Robach has his eye on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125859/http://gothamist.com/tags/secession">secession</a>; the Republican proposed legislation that would allow the state&apos;s 62 counties to hold a referendum in 2010 asking voters: &#x201C;Do you support the division of New York into two separate states?&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125859/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/on-the-road-should-new-york-state-be-split/">CityRoom</a> takes out the history books, noting that our state&apos;s boundaries have been largely unchanged since the Constitution was ratified in 1787. So why now? <p></p>

<p>The Senator, who represents Rochester, claims &#x201C;there is a large degree of apparent support for dividing New York into two separate states, so as to separate the distinct social and political concerns between upstate and downstate New York.&quot; In fact, he thinks upstate New York has &quot;more in common with Pennsylvania and Ohio than with New York City.&quot; </p>

They also take the pulse of local voters, saying they either &quot;love it because they hate New York City or because they think upstate taxpayers send too much money down there.&quot; The paper is quick to point out: &quot;New York City subsidizes us.&quot; (We actually give Albany <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125859/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/30/the_war_between.php">$10+ billion more than we get back</a>).</p>
