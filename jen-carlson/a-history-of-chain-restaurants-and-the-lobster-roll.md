title: A History Of Chain Restaurants And The Lobster Roll
---

	
										<p>For better or for worse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110814/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php">lobster rolls</a> sometimes end up in fast food chains. Perhaps it seems unnatural, but some curious eaters have tried them out anyway... here are some notes from the bottom of the food chains. Have you spotted a lobster roll where it shouldn&apos;t be? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110814/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">Tell us about it</a>.</p>
