<p>Forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135523/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/girl_scout_cookie_pop-up_shops_are.php">tracking down</a> Girl Scout cookies, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135523/http://chicagoist.com/2012/02/28/how_to_make_homemade_thin_mints.php#photo-1">making your own</a> at home, the organization just announced a game changer. They have teamed up with Nestle to produce a Thin Mints Crunch bar! Unless our eyesight is failing us, it appears that the bar contains 200 calories, 100 grams of fat, and 24 carbs; and they&apos;re made from <strong>dark chocolate cookie wafers, mint chocolate creme, airy crispies</strong>, and magic, probably. However, they won&apos;t be available to the public for months. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135523/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2108092/Girl-Scouts-humble-cookie-21st-century-new-candy-bar.html">A rep said</a>:</p>
