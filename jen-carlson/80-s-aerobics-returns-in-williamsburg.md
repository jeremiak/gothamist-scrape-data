										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="fondaaerobics0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010434im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/fondaaerobics0311.jpg" width="365" height="365" class="image-right"> </span>It&apos;s not a totally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010434/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/fashion/13fitness.html">new idea</a>, but how has this not become <em>a thing</em> yet? Why aren&apos;t we all rushing off to jazzercise after work? Camille Eroy-Reveles, owner of a Williamsburg-based fitness training company called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010434/http://www.theltrainer.com/">The L Trainer</a>, tells us she&apos;s currently hosting a free &apos;80s aerobics class every Tuesday night from 8 to 9 p.m. in (where else) Williamsburg. The next session is tomorrow, and Eroy-Reveles suggests you drop by in your spandex and legwarmers, because &apos;80s gear is encouraged! (<em>Luckily</em> American Apparel has been mass producing &apos;80s aerobics gear for years; Dov Charney, prepare for a spike in sales if this thing takes off!)</p>

<p>We asked the teach why she wanted to bring 80s aerobics back, and she tells us, &quot;There is a tendency in the fitness industry to take things too seriously. But when you have a neon headband and leotard on you get back to what exercise is really about&#x2014;having fun and feeling good.&quot; As for her muse, she says her favorite aerobics tapes are without a doubt those starring fitness queen Jane Fonda. So get ready for tomorrow&apos;s class (at 118 North 11th Street, 3rd Floor) with a quick stretch and the below workout&#x2014;and don&apos;t forget to take your daily iron<em>y</em> pills while you&apos;re at it.</p>
