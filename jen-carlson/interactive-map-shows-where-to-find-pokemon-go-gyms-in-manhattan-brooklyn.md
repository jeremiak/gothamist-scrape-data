<p>&quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321045952/http://gothamist.com/tags/pokemongo">Pok&#xE9;mon Go</a>, starving hysterical Luring, dragging themselves through the streets at dawn looking for a Gym... angelheaded hipsters burning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321045952/http://www.tomsguide.com/us/pokemon-go-guide,review-3761-2.html">Incense</a> for the ancient heavenly connection to the Stardust dynamo in the machinery of the night.&#x201D; Rest easy, Pok&#xE9;souls, a rental search company in NYC has now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321045952/https://www.renthop.com/studies/nyc/where-are-all-the-pokemon-gyms-in-new-york-city">created a map</a> featuring all of the gyms in Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Presumably if you&apos;ve read this far you already know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321045952/http://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/teams-gyms/">what a gym is</a> in the Pok&#xE9;mon Go universe, but here&apos;s an explainer from our in-house expert: &quot;Gyms are the large tower locations where you battle with other players. They get claimed by one of the three teams (you pick one at Level 5) and it&#x2019;s basically the turf wars aspect of the game.&quot;</p>

<p>Renthop created this map after not being able to find a comprehensive list of gyms for NYC, explaining, &quot;We decided to build our own... members of our team drove around Manhattan and Brooklyn to map out each Pok&#xE9;mon Go gym in NYC.&quot; And by &quot;NYC&quot; they mean everywhere but Staten Island, the Bronx, Queens, and a big ol&apos; chunk of Brooklyn...</p>

Have fun staring at your phone this weekend.
