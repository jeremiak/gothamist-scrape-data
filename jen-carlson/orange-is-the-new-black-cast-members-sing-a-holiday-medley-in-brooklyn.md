title: Orange Is The New Black Cast Members Sing A Holiday Medley In Brooklyn
---

	
										<p>A couple of ladies from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201405/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/15/orange_is_the_new_black.php"><em>Orange is the New Black</em></a> (Crazy Eyes and Taystee!) got together to perform a &quot;Jolly Christmas Medley&quot; (part &quot;Silent Night&quot; part &quot;Deck The Halls&quot;) in what appears to be the exterior spaces of a Brooklyn brownstone. Which would make sense since the show films around New York, and that backing band is Brooklyn band Oh Honey. It&apos;s a fun, nice, good thing to watch:</p>

<p>They ask that you consider donating to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201405/http://asteponline.org/">Artists Striving To End Poverty</a> at the end. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201405/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/27/how_to_volunteer_nyc.php">here are some more places</a> you can donate to this holiday season... and all the other days of the year.
