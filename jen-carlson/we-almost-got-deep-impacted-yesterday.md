<p>Did you see something flying through the sky yesterday afternoon? Don&apos;t worry, <em>they</em> aren&apos;t coming for us (yet!), turns out it was just a rare mid-day meteor. The sightings quickly accumulated on Twitter, where one woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141451/http://twitter.com/#!/themothergeek/statuses/37205545068797953">declared</a>, &quot;Just saw a weird comet-like thingy go over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141451/http://rooseveltislander.blogspot.com/2011/02/what-was-that-object-hurtling-through.html">Roosevelt Island</a>.&quot; It was also spotted over Manhattan, and as far away as Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>NASA scientist Bill Cooke says it was likely traveling at a speed of 33,500 m.p.h. as it entered the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141451/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local-beat/Meteor-Spotted-Over-Connecticut-Was-Big-116239469.html">He added</a>, &quot;My crude estimate of the energy of this fireball is about 100 tons of TNT, which means it was capable of producing a crater 125 feet in diameter and about 15 feet deep.&quot; As a comparison, the comet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141451/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120647/faq#.2.1.1">in <em>Deep Impact</em></a> was almost 3 miles wide!</p>

<p>The American Meteor Society (AMS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141451/http://www.myfoxphilly.com/dpp/news/local_news/021511-meteor-spotted-by-fox-29-viewers-confirmed">confirmed</a>, and noted, &quot;With it terminating over the Atlantic Ocean, there is no hope for recovering any possible debris.&quot; Don&apos;t even bother looking for the debris of the <strike>UFO</strike> meteor, nothing to see here!</p>
