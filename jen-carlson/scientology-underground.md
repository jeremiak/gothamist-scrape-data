Scientologists! The <strike>religion</strike> <strike>cult</strike> &quot;legendarily opportunistic Church Of Scientology&quot; is back underground giving out free stress tests. </p>

<p>Though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://gothamist.com/2005/03/29/subway_scientologists_sacked.php">police kicked them out in 2005</a> for violating New York City Transit rules about vending in the subways, it seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexerde/159787882/">they&apos;ve still had</a> a presence down there and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://www.flickr.com/photos/vsny/235588404/">from this photo</a> (taken in late 2006), they&apos;re still selling <em>Dianetics</em> (translated in 50 different languages, no less). </p>

<p>The Scientologists continue on their quest to make more cash and recruit new members this way, which is quite a different approach from getting a Scientology artist to integrate plugs for the religion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://officegnome.typepad.com/office_gnome/2004/10/l_ron_strikes_a.html">on the MTA&apos;s centennial posters</a> (circa 2004).  For many the tables have become a familiar site during the morning commute, but is anyone drinking the Kool-Aid aside from tourists who don&apos;t seem to realize this is more than a free test?  And is it a smart move to position recruitment tables in one of the most stressful city environments?  </p>

<p>There&apos;s an equally crazy test online <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://testing.dianetics.org/html/en_US/test/">here</a>, for those interested, and for those who want the group out of the way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/mta_nyc.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php">send the MTA a little note</a> telling them the Scientologists and their stress tests are stressing you out. </p>

<p>The Jews for Jesus also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/07/jesus_and_the_j.php">took their campaign to the MTA&apos;s subway posters</a> last year.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The Scientologists have also just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232555/http://www.observer.com/2007/church-scientology-buys-more-property-125th-street">purchased property in Harlem</a>. </p>
