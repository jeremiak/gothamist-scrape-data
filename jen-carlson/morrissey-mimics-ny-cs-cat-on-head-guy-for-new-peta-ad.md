<p>Are PETA and Morrissey paying homage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213919/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/photos_men_wearing_cats_on_their_he.php#photo-2">Charlie Perito</a>, the man who walks around the city with a cat on his head? The singer teamed up with the animals rights organization (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213919/http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/tags/morrissey/default.aspx">again</a>), for a spay and neuter campaign that features a photo of Morrissey with a cat on his head (which has been circulating for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213919/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/odd/news/a318701/morrissey-with-a-cat-on-his-head.html">a while now</a>). In their coverage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213919/http://www.pitchfork.com/news/47240-morrissey-poses-with-a-cat-on-his-head-in-peta-ad/">Pitchfork</a> neglected to call it &quot;derivative.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding the campaign itself, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213919/http://action.peta.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=5&amp;ea.campaign.id=13925">Morrissey says</a>, &quot;Letting cats or dogs have litters is tantamount to shooting shelter animals in the head since it kills their chances of adoption. Please do the right thing and spay or neuter your animals.&quot; PETA added, &quot;Although no one wants to dwell on this harsh reality, Morrissey reminds us that the animal overpopulation crisis must not be ignored.&quot;</p>
