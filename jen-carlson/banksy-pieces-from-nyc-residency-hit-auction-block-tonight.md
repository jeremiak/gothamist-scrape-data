<p>Two of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414042155/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s pieces from his New York City residency are down in Miami, after Manhattan gallery owner Stephan Keszler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414042155/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/nyc_art_gallery_owner_selling_banks.php">claimed them as his own</a> to sell. The Bandaged Heart (ripped from a wall in Red Hook and later purchased by Keszler) and Crazy Horse Car Door (which Keszler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414042155/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php#photo-1">had towed away</a> from a Lower East Side lot) will be on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414042155/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/banksys_heart_balloon_to_be_sold_in.php">auction block</a> in Florida tonight. The balloon was last seen at the Art Miami Fair <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414042155/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/04/banksy_red_hook_wall_now_behind_vel.php">behind a velvet rope</a> in December.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414042155/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/banksy-works-offered-miami-auction-22564520">the AP</a>, the works are expected to bring Keszler hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Fine Art Auction (street art expert Sebastien Laboureau told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414042155/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303945704579389093887369188?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection&amp;mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303945704579389093887369188.html%3Fmod%3DWSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">the WSJ</a> the balloon could get up to $600,000). Keszler has sold Banksy works before, and says he got into it &quot;because no one else is doing it. It&apos;s a very good niche.&quot;</p>
