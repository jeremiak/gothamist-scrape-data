<p>If you&apos;ve ever wanted to see a taping of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155152/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive">Saturday Night Live</a>, now is your best shot to get into a seat during the upcoming 41st season. The SNL ticket lottery is going on now through September 1st.</p>

<p>The enter, all you need to do is email (only one time counts!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155152/mailto:snltickets@nbcuni.com">snltickets@nbcuni.com</a>. Then wait. If you win, you&apos;ll get two tickets to a show not of your choosing. Don&apos;t be so picky. If you don&apos;t win, you&apos;ll have to try your luck waiting on line at 30 Rock the day of a show. Here&apos;s the full set of instructions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155152/http://www.nbc.com/tickets-and-nbc-studio-tour">from NBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>To enter the Saturday Night Live ticket lottery for the upcoming 2015-2016 season send an email in the month of August only to snltickets@nbcuni.com. Please include all contact information and do not request a specific date. If you are selected, you will receive two tickets to a random show date and time. You may only send one email per household and all audience members must be at least 16 years of age. Please note that entering the lottery does not guarantee tickets, and you will only be notified in the event that you are chosen.

<p>Stand-by tickets are distributed at 7am on the 48th st. side of 30 Rockefeller Plaza on the mornings of the show. You may choose a stand-by ticket for either the 8pm dress rehearsal or the 11:30pm live broadcast. Aside from minimal, necessary breaks, all stand-by line members must remain in line at all times. Stand-by tickets are limited to one per person and are issued on a first-come, first-served basis. Every member of the line is required to present a valid photo ID when the ticket is issued, as well as at the return time. Please note that all tickets are non-transferrable and non-exchangeable. NBC staff reserves the right to revoke or not issue any ticket to anyone in line if proper procedures are not followed. Please arrive no later than 7:15pm for the dress rehearsal or 10:45pm for the live show. A stand-by ticket does not guarantee admission and no one under the age of 16 will be admitted.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The show hasn&apos;t announced a premiere date yet, but they usually premiere the new seasons around the end of September.</p>
