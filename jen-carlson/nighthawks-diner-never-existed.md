<p>You know that famous Nighthawks painting featuring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818104752/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks">a diner</a>? Well <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818104752/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2010/06/finding-nighthawks-part-3.html">VanishingNY</a> has been investigating the establishment featured in the now iconic Edward Hopper piece, which is popularly believed to have stood at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818104752/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulry_Square">Mulry Square</a> (also known as block 613, Lot 62, on the corner where 7th Avenue South hits Perry Street). After an exhaustive search, however, the sad truth was uncovered: the diner never existed, at least not in any real, someone once ordered a milkshake there kind of way.</p>

<p>In Hopper&apos;s biography, the author states that the diner in the painting was &quot;based partly on an all-night coffee stand Hopper saw on Greenwich Avenue.&quot; And Hopper himself had said, &quot;I simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant bigger. Unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.&quot; So if it really never existed, what did he base the scene on? Vanishing notes that there may have been a mystery diner at Perry and 7th, of which no photos have turned up... yet!</p>
