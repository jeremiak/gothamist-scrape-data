										<p>Recently we got a blurry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152015/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/sneak_peek_fdnys_2012_calendar.php">sneak peek</a> at what the 2012 FDNY calendar will look like... and now there&apos;s (crystal clear) video to go with it. They say the clip will &quot;take you behind the scenes of the FDNY 2012 calendar shoot&quot; but <em>they do not say</em> to turn the volume up so you can hear the extra-special &apos;70s-porn-meets-muzak background music. So we are here to tell you: turn it up to 11.</p>

<p>Proceeds from the calendar will benefit the FDNY Foundation, you can order yours <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152015/http://www.fdnyfirezone.org/">here</a> (when they are available).</p>
