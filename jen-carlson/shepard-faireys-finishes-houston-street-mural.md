<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718022946/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/mural_1.php">Yesterday</a> Shepard Fairey was all, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll finish when we finish. We&#x2019;re on California time,&quot; when asked about his mural going up on Houston Street (in place of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718022946/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/16/sace_dedication.php">Os Gemeos</a> one). Flash forward to today and: it&apos;s done! But then again, even on California time it probably doesn&apos;t take very long to wheatpaste something. What do you think of the final product?</p>
