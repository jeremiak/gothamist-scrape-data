<p>Kanye West was headlining the Meadows Festival in NYC on Sunday night, and was mid-song when he stopped abruptly, telling the audience: &quot;I&apos;m sorry... I&apos;m sorry... family emergency, I have to stop the show.&quot; While at first it was unclear what the emergency was, it was later reported that Kim Kardashian West had been held at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room by armed men. Her spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017023923/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/02/entertainment/kanye-west-family-emergency/index.html">told CNN</a>, &quot;Kim Kardashian West was held up at gunpoint inside her Paris hotel room this evening, by two armed masked men dressed as police officers. She is badly shaken but physically unharmed.&quot;</p>

<p>According to one attendee of the festival, West was alerted of the emergency by someone who ran on stage: </p>
