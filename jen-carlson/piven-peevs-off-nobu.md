Entourage&apos;s Ari Gold was told he better keep away from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180516/http://www.nobumatsuhisa.com/flash/index.html">Nobu Matsuhisa</a>&apos;s restaurant empire after his behavior in the Aspen during the recent Comedy Arts Festival there.

</p><p>How does one get banned from Nobu? After a rude comment to the manager on his way out of the restaurant he left a DVD of the first season of Entourage...AS A TIP. Allegedly an employee ran up the stairs and hurled it at him as he was leaving. The Daily News reports that Piven said through his rep: &quot;I&apos;m such a fan of Nobu and all of his restaurants. I had a great dinner at the Nobu in Aspen. As always, the meal was excellent and the service was great.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;re gonna have to side with Nobu here, we&apos;ve seen what he can do with a knife! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180516/http://ultragrrrl.blogspot.com/2007/03/fuck-world-mutual-friend-of-mine-and.html">Ultragrrrl relays another story</a> (through a friend) of Piven&apos;s behavior: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;some friends of mine are in somewhat popular band and when they were in LA recording their cd, they went to a justin timberlake show and snuck into the VIP area. their guitar player introduced himself to jeremy piven and they made some small talk, then he started talking about the band. i guess piven stood there for about 30 seconds boredly nodding his head, then all of the sudden he literally grabbed the kids ear, pulled him towards him and whispered &quot;i dont give a FUCK about your band, now get the fuck away from me&quot; and pushed his head backwards and walked away.

<p>i really would have been disappointed if jeremy piven HADN&apos;T done that.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Looks like Piven could use another trip to India, the above photo is from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180516/http://dhd.discovery.com/fansites/piven/about/about.html">Journey of a Lifetime</a> show.</p>
