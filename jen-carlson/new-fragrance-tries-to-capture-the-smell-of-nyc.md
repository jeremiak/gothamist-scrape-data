<p>Taking a cue from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602034619/http://www.bondno9.com/">Bond No. 9</a>&#x2014;who for years has been peddling scents purporting to smell like parts of New York City&#x2014;a perfume called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602034619/http://usa.thescentofdeparture.com/">Scent of Departure</a> has now attempted to bottle New York... and other cities, too.  </p>

<p>The Scent of Departure&apos;s new line of fragrances are &quot;the essence of a city in a bottle,&quot; with New York given notes of apples, roses, caramel, vanilla, and more. They say the finished product is: &quot;A lovely sunny day in the Big Apple City. The air is filled with the scents of lilac and rose from the vast and majestic Central Park. You are walking along Times Square under the mild and fresh breeze from New York harbour. Enjoy this modern, crisp and invigorating fragrance with sparkling and sourish notes of apple.&quot; But what about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602034619/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/do_you_guys_smell_toast.php">the TOAST</a>? </p>

<p>Seriously though, does that sound totally inaccurate to anyone else? [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602034619/http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2012/06/perfume">the Economist</a>]</p>
