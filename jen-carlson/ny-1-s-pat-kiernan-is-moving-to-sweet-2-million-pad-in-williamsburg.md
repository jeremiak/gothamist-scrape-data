With Kelly</em> guest-host, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124044839/http://gothamist.com/tags/patkiernan">Pat Kiernan</a>, may be moving to Brooklyn, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124044839/http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2012/04/pat-kiernan-goes-seriously-baller-with-williamsburg-house-buy/?stream=true">Brownstoner</a> has uncovered some public records showing that Kiernan and his family will be making a home in Williamsburg form the UWS. And at just over $2 million, it&apos;s reportedly &quot;the highest price ever paid for a single family home in Williamsburg,&quot; <p></p>

<p>His new digs (video below)&#x2014;a single family home on Bedford Avenue&#x2014;is just blocks from L train, meaning that if he lands <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124044839/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/18/pat_kiernan_is_returning_to_co-host.php">the Kelly gig</a> permanently, he&apos;ll be dealing with one transfer during the 30 minute (on a good day) commute.</p>

<p>In anticipation of his second and third guest-hosting gigs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124044839/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/fashion/pat-kiernan-of-ny1-sets-his-sights-on-live-with-kelly.html?adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1335387828-4IQeMeTI3YrrKRjbsvXg4Q">the NY Times</a> just profiled Kiernan, who told them of his daytime talk show dream: &#x201C;My pitch to them is that, in the long term, what I&#x2019;m contributing is something that changes every day. She&#x2019;s had a lot of co-hosts on who have had great chats, but the chats are about the co-host&#x2019;s personal life. There&#x2019;s a point at which some of these people will have told all their personal stories, and you&#x2019;re doing 200 shows a year. I&#x2019;ve proven for 15 years that I can get up and keep it fresh.&quot; Brooklyn, you&apos;re getting one of the good ones.</p>
