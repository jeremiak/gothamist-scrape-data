<p>The Verrazano Narrows is easily one of the city&apos;s most beautiful bridges. Linking Brooklyn and Staten Island, the sleek double-decker suspension bridge has been around since the 1960s. </p>

<p>Edward Tadross sent us the below video this week which brings us back in time to the bridge&apos;s construction (which began in 1959) and, eventually, its opening (in November 1964). The footage&#x2014;which runs about 20 minutes long&#x2014;was shot by his father, a civil engineer who worked on the bridge. &quot;My family recently unearthed&quot; the video, Tadross told us, though he wasn&apos;t born at the time so has no memories of his own to share. <br>

Take a look&#x2014;you&apos;ll even see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323100122/http://www.heyridge.com/2015/08/before-ferry-service-returns-to-bay-ridge-a-look-back-at-the-neighborhoods-ferry-history/">the old (Bay Ridge) 69th Street ferry</a> cruise by towards the end, which will make a comeback <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323100122/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/04/expanded_ferry_map_nyc.php">next year</a>.</p>
