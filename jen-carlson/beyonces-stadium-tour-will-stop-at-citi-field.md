<p>There&apos;s nothing like seeing your favorite artist in a nice, intimate venue. If you missed Beyonc&#xE9; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112324/http://sfist.com/2016/02/07/super_bowl_50_coldplay_refuses_to_l.php">at the Super Bowl</a> yesterday, fear not, she&apos;ll be coming to an area sports stadium near you sometime soon. Last night the Mets and Citi Field <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112324/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/ticketing/beyonce.jsp?partnerId=ed-10023679-871588083">announced</a> that she&apos;ll be performing there on June 7th as part of her upcoming Formation tour. This is Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s first concert at Citi Field, and we expect she&apos;ll add one more show to this date&#x2014;currently there&apos;s a couple of days left open on her schedule following this one.</p>

<p>Tickets will be available starting February 16th at 10 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112324/http://www.ticketmaster.com/Beyonce-tickets/artist/894191">through Ticketmaster</a> (online or call 1-800-745-3000). Citi Field has a capacity of around 40,000. During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112324/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Run_Tour_(Beyonc%C3%A9_and_Jay_Z)">her 2014 tour with Jay Z</a>, her most local shows were at the massive MetLife Stadium.</p>

<p>ICYMI (how?!) Beyonc&#xE9; surprised everyone with a new song on Saturday:</p>
