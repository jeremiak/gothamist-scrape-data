There is, but here we are again. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816214625/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/62917/">NYMag</a> has a profile on Maggie Gyllenhaal&apos;s life in the borough, which they got to witness first hand on a recent visit to her Park Slope <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816214625/http://curbed.com/archives/2006/09/27/gyllenhaalontheslope_the_story_the_fallout.php">brownstone</a> that she shares with hubby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816214625/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/peter_saarsgard_actor.php">Peter Sarsgaard</a> and their 3-year-old, Ramona.</p>

<p>Gyllenhaal points out that the grass isn&apos;t always greener, however, noting, &#x201C;I had no idea what I was taking on: a brownstone that hadn&#x2019;t been touched since the seventies. We made huge mistakes. At first, when we got bids on work, we said, &#x2018;Of course we&#x2019;ll take the cheapest bid.&#x2019; Which I would not do anymore at all.&#x201D; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816214625/http://gothamist.com/tags/norahjones">Norah Jones</a>, are you listening?)</p>

<p>Add a child to the mix, and forget about it! The actress says &quot;life becomes impossible if you&#x2019;re not organized. Like, to take the subway with a huge diaper bag full of all sorts of shit is awful.&#x201D; For housekeeping tips, she says she&apos;s currently reading <em>Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House</em>... though apparently she hasn&apos;t gotten to the part about how buying a coffee maker can help save money <em>and</em> face at the local coffee shop. The couple recently called up Gorilla to order 20 to-go cups of coffee, but she says they were &quot;a little tough. I mean, we go there every day. And they were like, &#x2018;Uh, I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x2019;&quot;</p>
