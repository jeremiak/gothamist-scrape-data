<p>Over the weekend we finally watched &quot;My Life As A Turkey,&quot; a PBS special that recreates a Florida man&apos;s odd year and a half as a mother to sixteen wild turkeys. It&apos;s basically like <em>Grizzly Man</em>, but with less crazy and more turkeys. A little introduction to the 50-minute documentary, which we highly recommend watching (especially Staten Islanders):</p>

<blockquote>&quot;After a local farmer left a bowl of eggs on Joe Hutto&#x2019;s front porch, his life was forever changed. Hutto, possessing a broad background in the natural sciences and an interest in imprinting young animals, incubated the eggs and waited for them to hatch. As the chicks emerged from their shells, they locked eyes with an unusual but dedicated mother. One man&#x2019;s remarkable experience of raising a group of wild turkey hatchlings to adulthood.&quot;</blockquote>Check it out for yourself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200135/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/my-life-as-a-turkey/full-episode/7378/">on PBS</a>, where it&apos;s streaming for free.

<p>Warning: after meeting Sweet Pea, one of the turkeys, you may not want to eat a bird on Thanksgiving.</p>
