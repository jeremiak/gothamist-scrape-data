Last night we sent photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://flickr.com/photos/digitalink">Raymond Haddad</a> to the I&apos;m Not There concert at Beacon Theater. Calexico, The Roots, My Morning Jacket, J Mascis, Yo La Tengo, Mason Jennings, Joe Henry, Mark Lanegan, Lee Ranaldo &amp; the Million Dollar Bashers and many more were on hand to celebrate the soundtrack, the film and of course Bob Dylan himself (who, in fact, <em>was not there</em>). 

</p><p>The soundtrack is a double-discer that&apos;s been getting praise from just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://www.stereogum.com/archives/new-karen-o-highway-61-revisited-stereogum-premier.html">about</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/46694-im-not-there-ost">everyone</a>. Don&apos;t like Dylan&apos;s voice? Maybe you&apos;ll like his songs with Chan Marshall singing them. Or not. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://www.muzzleofbees.com/2007/11/08/im-not-there-in-concert-beacon-theatre-ny/">Muzzle of Bees</a> was at the show last night, too, and reports it &quot;wasn&#x2019;t enough to justify the price&quot; and the Roots performance of <em>Masters of War</em> &quot;to the tune of the Star Spangled Banner before unleashing their inner Hendrix was probably the evening&#x2019;s highlight.&quot; However, we heard great things about the evening -- and apparently Heath Ledger was one of many who enjoyed it, word is he was possibly a little bit maybe stoned backstage (unsubstantiated!). The Roots are pictured above, on and off stage, and after the jump a few more performers from the evening. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/magazine/07Haynes.html?pagewanted=1">The NY Times</a> had an article about the Todd Haynes&#x2019;s not-really-about-Dylan, but totally about Dylan, biopic last month, in which six actors play the folk singer -- including Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://ultragrrrl.blogspot.com/2007/11/im-not-there.html">Ultragrrrl&apos;s intern Marcus</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/26/dylan_biopic.php">The movie</a> is out on November 21st (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225002631/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZGseissqX8">watch the trailer here</a>).</p>
