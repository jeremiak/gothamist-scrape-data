<p>Tonight&apos;s episode of <em>The Americans</em> (NO SPOILERS), is called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175156/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyrldKkaK74">The Magic of David Copperfield V: The Statue of Liberty Disappears</a>.&quot; Throughout it you will see the magician&apos;s 1983 television special turning up on the Jennings&apos; television screen, a relevant timestamp in a show about Soviet intelligence agents spying on the American government. </p>

<p>In the 1980s, Copperfield made Lady Liberty disappear, he explained, because he wanted to show &quot;how precious liberty is and how easily it can be lost. I can show with magic how we take our freedom for granted. So I asked our government for permission to make the Statue of Liberty disappear, just for a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>The event was televised live on April 8th, 1983, and a live audience was positioned in front of the statue to witness it&#x2014;there were only about twenty of them (described as tourists), and even the most skeptical were shocked. A curtain went up, and when it was pulled away (after Copperfield massages his temples) Lady Liberty was a goner.</p>

<p>The trick itself only lasted moments, but the special that aired included a lot of build-up, including some explanation on what was about to happen&#x2014;one commentator explained: &quot;Surrounding the statue we placed three instant cameras. These will inject their instant photographs into these locked boxes. They&apos;ll be set off before the illusion begins and take continuous photographs in sequence to provide photographic proof of the statue&apos;s disappearance from three different angles.&quot; Naturally, given the decade, young models were tasked with manning these cameras and posing with them.</p>

<p>There were radar screens bleeping to show the statue&apos;s existence and eventual disappearance. There were helicopters with floodlights to shine down to show the same thing. And when it happened, the audience was shocked: &quot;I have never seen a Statue of Liberty disappear like this one did,&quot; an elderly woman tells the cameras. You can watch it here:</p>

<p>It&apos;s been 33 years, so naturally the curtain has been pulled back on Copperfield&apos;s trick by now. How was it done? In short, the small audience was on a platform that very slowly rotated after the curtain (supported by two pillars, also on the platform) was draped in front of the Statue. By the time the curtain dropped, they were facing a different direction, and saw an empty space. Here you go, mate (that will make sense after you click play):</p>

<p>For even MORE, there are plenty of observations out there, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021175156/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Statue_of_Liberty_vanishing_trick">one that points out</a> that &quot;you can watch the video once again, and concentrate on the radar screen only, once the curtain is raised you will be able to see a reflection of some stationary light bulb which was set behind audience and the rotating stage... reflection on radar screen starts moving [counter]clockwise, and moves about quarter of a circle and stops.&quot;</p>
