Not many people. Which is why Matt Allen is pretty popular, since he is, after all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064742/http://www.icecreamman.com/">THE Ice Cream Man</a>. Allen drives around the country handing out free frozen treats - so far his travels have taken him (and his &apos;69 Chevy ice cream truck affectionately named Bessie) from St. Jude Children&apos;s Hospital to Bonnaroo to McCarren Park Pool (where he&apos;ll be this Sunday). Recently, we asked him what life on the good ship ice cream truck is like...</p>

<p><strong>You&apos;ve slung a lot of ice cream around New York, any good stories for us?</strong><br>
Last summer I had planned on spending a week or two in NYC and ended up spending a month.  Actually, the best day of my life was in New York last year.  It was the day of the first Pool Party at McCarren Pool.  We set a record for most free ice creams we&#x2019;ve given away on one day (over 2000) and rocked out to Les Savy Fav, Beans, Holy Fuck, Dragons of Zynth, and Proton Proton.  We couldn&#x2019;t have asked for a better day and as we were wrapping things up the guys in Holy Fuck told me they were planning on hitting a Broken Social Scene/Metric show in Manhattan and asked if I wanted to come along. </p>

<p>I had been keeping tabs on shows going on around town and hadn&#x2019;t heard anything about this one.  It turns out it was a private party for an international contest for Miller Brewing.  There were less than a hundred people there and they were flown in from all over the world for the show.  Broken Social Scene started off with a ten minute funk jam and midset I hollered out a request for &#x201C;It&#x2019;s All Gonna Break,&#x201D; my favorite BSS song.  Kevin Drew, the front man, thought about it for a sec then said.  &#x201C;well, we&#x2019;re not really following a setlist&#x201D; then they rocked an extended version it.   After the show a representative for Miller walked around the audience and informed us &#x201C;you should head upstairs, DJ Premier is spinning&#x201D;  WOW... I couldn&#x2019;t believe it.  Once up there I found I was the only one on the dance floor for a few songs.  Eventually some friends and I ran downstairs and convinced a lot of the folks there to head up for a dance party.  We danced til three or four in the morning.  It was a bit weird the next day looking back on everything and realizing that was the best day of my life. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a favorite frozen treat amongst your patrons?</strong><br>
That&#x2019;s a tough call.  I&#x2019;d say the most popular is usually the standard Vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich.  Sometimes certain items just take off.  Yesterday we were at William Morris in Manhattan and five of the first six treats I dished out were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  I had 48 sandwiches on board but only 12 turtles so I was a bit nervous.  It all worked out in the end though and I even stashed a Strawberry Fruit bar for myself, which ended up being my lunch.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ve given away over 90,000 free ice creams on our way to half a million.  The more ice cream I eat the more I like the simple ones and the fruit bars.  Some people don&#x2019;t think they like the &#x201C;fruit&#x201D; bars much but once they have a cantaloupe, pistachio, watermelon or some of the other exotic flavors we&#x2019;ve been known to carry (cucumber w/ lime, tamarindo w/ chile) they get hooked and then those flavors start flying off the truck.</p>
