<p>Late in 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325212832/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/nypl_underground_vaults.php">we went 27 feet below Bryant Park</a> to check in on the New York Public Library&apos;s stacks. About 17-feet below the lawn you&apos;ll find the Milstein Research Stacks, and now underneath that, a new space has been been built for the library&apos;s growing collections. Books and materials have now been relocated from the 105-year-old central stacks, an above-ground space with a yet-to-be-determined future. To get items into the hands of those that need them from the depths of Bryant Park, a conveyer system has been built. It&apos;s like a rollercoaster for literature!</p>

<p>The Library actually likens the system to a &quot;state-of-the-art book train,&quot; which will &quot;transport requested research materials from newly-expanded storage under Bryant Park to researchers throughout the library.&quot; The conveyer system features 24 individual red cars, all running on rails and &quot;seamlessly and automatically [making the] transition from horizontal to vertical motion. The cars can each transport up to 30 pounds of materials at a time from the Library&apos;s recently-expanded underground storage facility to the iconic Rose Main Reading Room on the third floor,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325212832/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/13/nypl_rose_reading_room_restoration.php#photo-1">which reopens on October 5th</a>. </p>

<p>The time to get from one end to the other: 5 minutes. You can watch some of the journey above.</p>
