<p>Not to be outdone by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235533/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/catherine_zeta_spotted_on_the_subwa.php">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, famous person Jake Gyllenhaal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235533/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/jake-gyllenhaal-rides-the-q-train.html">took the subway</a>  with the regular people last night. This is him on the Q train, standing in such a way that it&apos;s like <em>he knows</em> someone is armed with a camera phone nearby. Also, he is wearing sunglasses, underground, on the subway, at night. Maybe covering up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235533/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/05/swift.php">his tears</a>?</p>
