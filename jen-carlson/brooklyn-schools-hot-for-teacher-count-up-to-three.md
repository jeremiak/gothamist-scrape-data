(So really he was just being smart by not getting involved.) Meanwhile, there&apos;s now a third female being investigated. Allison Musacchio didn&apos;t share her colleagues interest in experimentation however, she went straight for the cliched-yet-still-scandalous teacher-student hook-up. </p>

<p>Social studies instructor Musacchio, 31 (pictured, far left), has now joined Alini Brito (far right) and Cindy Mauro (center) in the rubber room, after allegedly having relations with a male student. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708222312/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/12/10/2009-12-10_now_thats_social_studies_bklyn_school_also_investigating_3rd_teachers_private_le.html">the Daily News</a>, kids at the school have known about the affair since March, when a girl saw her ex&apos;s phone number in Musacchio&apos;s cell phone. Enter: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708222312/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/04/sexting_is_nothing_to_lol_about.php">sexting</a>! </p>

<p>Officials discovered over 200 texts and calls between the two. And where teenagers are involved, there&apos;s often a game of telephone &#x2014; The News says that a neighbor says that Musacchio said that the rumor is absolutely not true, adding, &quot;With my Greek background, I would never do something like that. I have morals and respect.&quot; Okay, case closed... any more photos surface of the language-teaching lesbian lovers on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708222312/http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brooklyn-NY/The-infamous-MsBrito-rumor/190749313204?v=wall&amp;ref=mf">that Facebook page</a> (which Musacchio <em>is a member of</em>)? Reportedly Ms. Mauro recently &quot;<strong>went punk, dying her hair pink, getting several new tattoos, and wearing tight, low-cut clothing</strong>&quot;... though photos taken of her outside her Bay Ridge apartment yesterday show her as a blonde.  Still, one neighbor said, &quot;She would have parties until 3 a.m. with mostly female guests. There would be people coming in at all hours making noise.&quot;</p>
