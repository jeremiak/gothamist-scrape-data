</div></div>					<p>Starting February 5th and running through May 20th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025011732/http://www.queensmuseum.org/9160/frank-oscar-larson-1950s-new-york-street-stories">the Queens Museum of Art</a> will be showing off the work of photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025011732/http://www.franklarsonphotos.com/">Frank Oscar Larson</a>, who documented the streets of New York in the 1950s. They&apos;re in possession of &quot;several thousand historic negatives hidden from sight for 55 years,&quot; and will bring 65 of them in print form to their &quot;1950s New York Street Stories&quot; installation. Larson was a Queens banker who had a &quot;lifelong passion for photography&quot; and yielded a tremendous images of everyday life in 1950s New York.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>

<blockquote>The negatives had been stored in more than 100 envelopes meticulously notated with location and date info in Larson&#x2019;s own hand.&#xA0;&#xA0;Since their discovery, Larson&#x2019;s grandson Soren has been overseeing the scanning and printing of the 55 year old images.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; According to Soren Larson, &#x201C;Photographs dating back to the 1920s attest to the fact that he was always the family shutterbug.&#xA0;&#xA0;But it wasn&#x2019;t until the early 1950s that Frank&#x2019;s passion for photography blossomed. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Larson made weekend expeditions around New York with his Rolleiflex Automat Model 4 camera around his neck, producing thousands of images which he developed in a basement darkroom.</blockquote>&#xA0;
