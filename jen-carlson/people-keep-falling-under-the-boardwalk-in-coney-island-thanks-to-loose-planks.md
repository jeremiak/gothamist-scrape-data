<p>In the past week we&apos;ve received three alerts of people falling through the boardwalk in Coney Island. The latest came last night just before midnight, when a woman went through the boardwalk at West 27th Street, and needed to be rescued when her leg got stuck. Another came on July 1st, on the boardwalk at West 17th Street, when a woman &quot;fell into the boardwalk&quot; and got &quot;stuck there.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the Parks Department (who have recognized a need for repair in the past) for a comment, and will update when/if we hear back. Activists have blamed them for the dilapidated boardwalk&#x2014;Todd Dobrin of Friends of the Boardwalk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404224402/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/walk_blaming_LfI6IDf7pjx9ndUA8PZC4K?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">says</a>, &#x201C;This is 100 percent the Parks Department&#x2019;s fault. If you don&#x2019;t maintain something, it&#x2019;ll fall apart.&#x201D; He notes that the &quot;war zone&#x201D; is located between West 23rd and West 27th streets, but we&apos;d be careful along the entire length of it.</p>

<p>Maybe it&apos;s just safer if we use the thing as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404224402/http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57465239-1/coney-island-boardwalk-becomes-ipad-stand-amplifier/">an iPod stand/amplifier</a>?</p>
