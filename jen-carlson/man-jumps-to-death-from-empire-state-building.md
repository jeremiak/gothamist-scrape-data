According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715082742/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/30/2010-03-30_man_leaps_to_his_death_from_86th_floor_observation_deck_at_empire_state_building.html">the Daily News</a>, he took a running leap at 6:15 p.m. from the 86th floor, &quot;clearing a fence and then the building&apos;s outermost ledge.&quot;<p></p>

<p>He landed on the 34th Street sidewalk during rush hour, and an onlooker told the paper, &quot;He came down in front of the Bank of America. Boom! It was an explosion. His body was shattered... one guy ran over and covered the body with an umbrella.&quot; </p>

<p>Police believe he was successful because there weren&apos;t many visitors due to the weather, reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715082742/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/man_kills_self_by_jumping_off_empire_gJ4noPn95xJOLovEsMIEpN#ixzz0jiXOQC7G">the Post</a>.

<p>A little dark history: the first person (of over 30) to commit suicide by jumping from the building was a construction worker who was, at the time, helping build it&#x2014;he had just been laid off. Another was 23-year-old Evelyn McHale, whose 1947 plunge resulted in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715082742/http://kottke.org/08/07/the-most-beautiful-suicide">World&apos;s Most Beautiful Suicide</a>.</p>
