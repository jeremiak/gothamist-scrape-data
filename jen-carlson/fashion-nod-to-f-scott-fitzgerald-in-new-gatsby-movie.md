Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s novel, the movie will have a small nod to the author. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311205512/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/great-gatsby-brooks-brothers-outfits-leonardo-dicaprio-tobey-maguire-334893?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Brooks Brothers worked with costume designer Catherine Martin to create the 1920s wardrobe worn by the male leads&#x2014;from formal tuxes to three-piece check suits, bow ties, and oxford shoes. Turns out Fitzgerald was a fan of the clothier, which is now headquartered on Madison Avenue (their first store opened in 1818, on the northeast corner of Catherine and Cherry streets).<p></p>

<p>Martin says, &quot;Fitzgerald was a Brooks Brothers customer. Brooks Brothers is mentioned numerous times in Fitzgerald&apos;s writings as a representation of the ultimate gentleman&apos;s purveyor of fine clothing.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311205512/http://offthecuffdc.com/brooks-brothers-american-icon-part-3">Off The Cuff</a> has some more history on the author&apos;s devotion to the brand:</p><blockquote>&quot;Though previously worn for sporting purposes, the soft collared button-down shirt was resurgent in the &#x2018;20s, now paired with more formal dress.  One of the first celebrities to regularly sport this subversively stylish garment was no less than legendary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311205512/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/21_photos_of_new_york_city_in_1922.php#photo-1">Jazz Age</a> writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Already a devotee of the brand, Fitzgerald was in fact wearing his Brooks Brothers dress uniform when he met Zelda, his future wife, at a military dance.  &apos;He smelled like new goods,&apos; she later recalled.  One only needs to read the heady, detailed and lovingly crafted descriptions of the character&#x2019;s wardrobes in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> to grasp Brook&#x2019;s influence on American style and lifestyle.&quot;</blockquote>So... look forward to the inevitable Gatsby line at Brooks Brothers around the time the movie comes out (there&apos;s already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311205512/http://www.brooksbrothers.com/IWCatSectionView.process?IWAction=Load&amp;Merchant_Id=1&amp;Section_Id=575&amp;section_size=&amp;section_color=&amp;sortby=newArrivals">a Fitzgerald line</a>).<p></p>
