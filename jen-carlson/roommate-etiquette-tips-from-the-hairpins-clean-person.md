<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102458/http://gothamist.com/tags/nationaletiquetteweek">National Etiquette Week</a>, and while most of you are likely marking this important occasion with a refresher course on which fork goes where in a place setting, perhaps some of you are wondering how you can be more considerate to those with whom you dwell. Here are a couple of suggestions on how to harness the power of cleaning in pursuit of a more perfect (roommate) union.</p>

<p><strong>THE BATHROOM</strong><br>
You know what&apos;s nasty? Other people&apos;s toothpaste spittle. Be a pal and give the sink basin &#x2014; and ledge if you&apos;re a sprayer &#x2014; a quick rinse when you&apos;re done brushing your fangs. If you&apos;re  an unbearded dude the same thing goes for those whiskers you leave behind when you shave. Wipe that mess up!</p>

<p>You know what&apos;s even nastier than other people&apos;s toothpaste spittle? Their pee-pee. If you tinkle on the seat, please wipe up after yourself. Even three year olds know how to do that. (That goes for you too, ladies. Mm-hmm.)</p>

<p>This last thing is hard to say, but you need to hear it: you might be at peace with your chronic hemorrhoid problem but maybe your roommate isn&apos;t so keen on that tube of Preparation H staring her in the face while she glues on her false eyelashes. So put your stuff away.</p>

<p><strong>THE KITCHEN</strong><br>
One day you&apos;ll wake up and decide that you no longer want to be the sort of person who engages in passive-aggressive trash wars (you know, that game you play where you smoosh the trash down and/or pull the sides of the bag up in order to convince yourself that the barrel isn&apos;t full? Psst &#x2026; you&apos;re not fooling anyone.) Let today be that day. </p>

<p>Leaving dishes in the sink isn&apos;t the worst crime in the world. But leaving them in the sink for more than &#x2014; oh let&apos;s say 12 hours? Sure, let&apos;s go with 12 hours. &#x2014; is kind of gross and also maybe someone else would like to use those dishes? Wash &apos;em in a reasonable timeframe. Oh and wipe those crumbs off the counter while you&apos;re at it. Thanks!!</p>

<p><strong>YOUR BEDROOM</strong><br>
If you want to be a slob in the privacy of your own bedroom, I say go for it! Seriously. We all have free will and should live the way we want to, as long as it doesn&apos;t negatively impact others. So by all means, leave that bed unmade (that was extremely difficult for me to write) but consider keeping your door shut so that your roommate doesn&apos;t have to see those dirty underpants lying on the floor.</p>
