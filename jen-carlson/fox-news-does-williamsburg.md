Fox News! They say that the borough is now a place where people live and cabbies will drive you, plus, it has a bunch of <em>scenes</em> that will rival any other borough. To help familiarize their readers, they offer up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302024353/http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2010/08/27/brooklyn/">this lexical tour</a>... let&apos;s skip to the Williamsburg section. <p></p>

<p>What to do in this neighborhood, where brave starving artists paved the way for luxury condo dwellers? Well, for one, &quot;there are free concerts, movies and pool parties held at the abandoned pool of McCarren Park.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302024353/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/01/mccarren_4.php">Good luck with that</a>! After a long day of searching for a concert series that hasn&apos;t taken place at this abandoned pool for two summers, one is likely to have worked up an appetite. </p>

<p>For this, Fox News suggests you head over to Sea Restaurant, which they call a &quot;gem.&quot; In fact, this is their <em>only</em> suggestion, noting that &quot;the exteriors of some restaurants, bars may not be as attractive as those found in Park Slope.&quot; For those who don&apos;t know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302024353/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3y3mUDYGz4">this is Sea&apos;s vibe</a>; one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302024353/http://www.yelp.com/biz/sea-thai-restaurant-and-bistro-brooklyn">Yelp</a> reviewer sums it up nicely, saying Sea is &quot;too New Joysey for a Thai restaurant in Brooklyn.&quot;</p>

<p>Can&apos;t wait to read their guide to The Bronx!</p>
