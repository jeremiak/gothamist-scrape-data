Last year everyone was all up in arms about this band called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145802/http://www.dungen-music.com/">Dungen</a>. No one pronounced their name the same way, but everyone proclaimed them &quot;their new favorite band&quot;. At least for that week. They played at the Siren Festival and then to a packed room at Mercury Lounge back then, and now the Swedish rockers return to New York next week. 

</p><p>We want you to be there. Seriously, it just wouldn&apos;t be the same without you. We have two pairs of tickets to give away, so you can bring some arm candy with you. If you want &apos;em, jus email your answer to the following question to CONTEST CLOSED. </p>
