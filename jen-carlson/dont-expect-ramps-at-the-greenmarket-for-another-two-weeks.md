<p>Almost two weeks ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140323072518/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/where_are_the_ramps.php">we checked in</a> on  the Most Important Vegetable Of Our Time: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140323072518/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">the ramp</a>. At the time, which now seems like centuries ago, a NYC Greenmarket rep told us that the &quot;cold snap means it&apos;s a bit too early for most of our farmers! Give it a couple more weeks at least.&quot; Today, after hearing that some people had been spotting ramps over the past week, we headed to Union Square Greenmarket... which is maddeningly ramp-less. <br>
  <br>
Rick Bishop of Mountain Sweet Berry Farm&#x2014;who tends to have ramps before anyone else&#x2014;told us that the cold and snow were responsible for the delay and that <strong>he expects to have them between April 12th and 15th</strong>. That is over <em>two weeks from now</em>. This is the cruelest Spring of them all.</p>
