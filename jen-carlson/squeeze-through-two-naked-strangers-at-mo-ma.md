</div></div>					<p>Warning: most of this gallery is NSFW! So of course that means someone got naked in the name of art, and it&apos;s making museum-goers a little uncomfortable. The Marina Abramovi&#x107; restrospective, which traces the artist&apos;s prolific career, only just opened at the MoMA yesterday and it&apos;s already offending people! The artist isn&apos;t scared to show a little skin, nothing new there, but one part of the installation has patrons squeezing through two naked performers. <em>Awkward</em>. However, the Yugoslavian-born performance artist wouldn&apos;t be doing her job if she didn&apos;t make her audience experience something they haven&apos;t before, no?</p>

<p>Some early attendees spoke to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150821004204/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/squeezy_does_it_at_moma_J8tMYHCGwBug8A4msnmmaL">the NY Post</a> about why that part of the installation was particularly bothersome; one explained, &quot;They&apos;re too close! I don&apos;t want to rub up against them!&quot; Meanwhile, an NYU grad student said she &quot;didn&apos;t feel normal. I&apos;ve never walked between two naked guys like that before&#x2014;not in public places.&quot; TMI?</p>

<p>&quot;Marina Abramovi&#x107;: The Artist is Present&quot; will be running at the MoMA through May 31st; it includes five (of around ninety) pieces she has created since 1969. You can read more about her work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150821004204/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_thurman">in the New Yorker</a>, and watch live video of the installation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150821004204/http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/marinaabramovic/">here</a>. But will you go and walk through the nudes? After all, this happens every day in New York City, albeit with a thin layer of fabric separating you from the naughty bits.</p>
