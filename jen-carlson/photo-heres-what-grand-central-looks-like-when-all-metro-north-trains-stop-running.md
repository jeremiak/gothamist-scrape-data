<p>Steve Burns, a passenger on one train, told us just after 9 p.m., &quot;I&apos;ve been at a standstill on a train headed to Poughkeepsie for over an hour and a half. Conductor tells us it&apos;s due to signal problems and all trains on the Hudson and Harlem lines are at a standstill. Last update 5 minutes ago was &apos;we still have no news, thanks for your patience.&apos;&quot; They&apos;re also handing out emergency water to some passengers: </p>
