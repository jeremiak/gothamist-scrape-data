<p>There is only one woman on earth who can have a web series that goes from talk of stage diving, stitches, and puddles of blood... straight into altars and chanting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020247/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> recently launched her new web series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020247/http://bit.ly/SubscribeNowXXCourtney">on YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020247/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3mqm-pQ3AI&amp;list=TL6TrSTKzm6EuNqjZ_mumJpHtxIeWefk8H">explains</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I&apos;ve said &apos;no&apos; so many times to doing lame TV shows over the years. But then along came the digital world to disrupt everything. There are so many cool things happening in web culture right now that I love&#x2014;from all the weird and fringy stuff, to the fun over the top personalities of YouTube vloggers. From cool fashion chick&apos;s videos and makeup tutorials, to some amazing discoveries in new music and art from all over the world.... watch me dive into the wild world of YouTube... and watch me have fun showing you all the things I&apos;m passionate about!&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The best part is she can use a lot of good music without any licensing issues.</p>
