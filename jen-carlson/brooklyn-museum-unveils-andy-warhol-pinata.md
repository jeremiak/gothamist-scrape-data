<p>If you&apos;ve ever wanted to punch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001626/http://gothamist.com/tags/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a> in the face, now is your time to shine! The Brooklyn Museum has created this huge pi&#xF1;ata of the pop artist for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001626/http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2010/04/15/a-pinata-grows-in-brooklyn/">their Gala</a> on April 22nd. The 20-footer will be smashed open by guests that evening, but until then the museum is keeping mum about what&apos;s inside, only revealing that it&apos;s edible (Campbell&apos;s soup cans?). In June they&apos;ll be bringing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001626/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/early_warhol.php">the artist&apos;s last decade</a> to their walls, in a less aggressive show of affection.</p>
