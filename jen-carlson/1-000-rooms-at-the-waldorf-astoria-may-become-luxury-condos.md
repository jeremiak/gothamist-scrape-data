<p>While it&apos;s not a done deal yet, the owners of the Waldorf-Astoria, the China-based Anbang Insurance Group, are looking to take 1,000 of their 1,420 hotel rooms and convert the square-footage into luxury condos. As of last year it is illegal for hotels with 150+ units to dedicate 20% of their property for residences, but according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309021854/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160614/REAL_ESTATE/160619935/waldorf-astoria-may-convert-1000-rooms-into-luxury-condos">to Crain&apos;s</a> &quot;the legislation exempted recent transactions, including the Waldorf Astoria.&quot; The site also points out that during the purchase process <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309021854/http://therealdeal.com/2015/02/19/waldorf-astorias-new-owner-to-add-condos/">in 2015</a>, Anbang filed to subdivide &quot;the building into different sections for condos, a hotel and retail... [setting] aside 1.2 million square feet&#x2014;approximately 75% of the building&#x2014;for residential use.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309021854/http://nypost.com/2016/06/15/soon-youll-be-able-to-live-at-the-waldorf-astoria/">The NY Post</a> notes that &quot;the remainder of the space [would be turned] into a smaller five-star hotel,&quot; if plans move forward.</p>

<p>Should they move ahead, however, they would still need to get their plans past the state attorney general&apos;s office.</p>

<p>The Waldorf has always had some residential units&#x2014;Marilyn Monroe would stay there, Frank Sinatra kept a suite there, and Roz Cole lived there for nearly 50 years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309021854/http://nypost.com/2016/04/16/waldorfs-longest-tenured-resident-owed-1m-when-she-died-suit/">whether they liked it or not</a>. The hotel has a 181-room boutique hotel within it, called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309021854/http://www.waldorftowersresidences.com/about-waldorf-towers/">Waldorf Towers</a>, which is also where these rentable residential apartments are located. Transforming around 75% of the iconic hotel into luxury residences, however, would be a huge move.</p>
