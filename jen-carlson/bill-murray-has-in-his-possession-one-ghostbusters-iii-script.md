										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ghostbusters30211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307014202im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ghostbusters30211.jpg" width="365" height="370" class="image-right"> </span>Bill Murray called in to the Howard Stern show this week and talked a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307014202/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters"><em>Ghostbusters III</em></a> with the host, saying, &quot;There&apos;s a script somewhere [on my desk], but I haven&apos;t read it yet. I feel bad.&quot; We&apos;d feel like this might be a tease but if Murray hasn&apos;t read it, then Murray hasn&apos;t written it, nor was he involved in writing it&#x2014;so how good can it be? He added, &quot;You know, the studio gets excited every 10 years or so. What they&apos;d really like to do is recreate the franchise. I remember when the new Ghostbusters was going to be Chris Rock, Chris Farley and... someone.&quot;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307014202/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/05/the_ghostbusters_return.php">rumor in 2008</a> had Seth Rogan and Paul Rudd attached, and at that time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307014202/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/08/ramis_confirms_ghostbusters_iii.php">Judd Apatow</a>&apos;s production company was also rumored to be involved, but since then it&apos;s been refuted.</p>

<p>Whoever wrote the script on Murray&apos;s desk, he may never read it; when asked whether he thought it would be a bad idea, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307014202/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1621778.php/Bill-Murray-still-holding-out-hope-for-Ghostbusters-3">he responded</a>, &quot;I only made one sequel and it was <em>Ghostbusters 2</em> and it didn&#x2019;t end up the way it was presented&#x201D;</p>
