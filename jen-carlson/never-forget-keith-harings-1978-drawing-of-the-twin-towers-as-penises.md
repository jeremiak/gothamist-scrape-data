<p>Tomorrow the Brooklyn Museum will open their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161333/http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/keith_haring/">Keith Haring 1978-1982</a> exhibit, the first large-scale exhibition to explore the artist&apos;s early career, and we stopped by this morning for a press preview. We&apos;ll have a full look at the show tomorrow, but right now let&apos;s focus on this piece that was catching a lot of eyes: a 1978 pencil drawing of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161333/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldtradecenter">World Trade Center</a>.
