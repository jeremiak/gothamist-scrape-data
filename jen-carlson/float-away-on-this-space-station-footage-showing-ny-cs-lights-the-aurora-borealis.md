<p>The International Space Station orbits 255 miles above the Earth, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051509/http://www.space.com/35162-best-earth-from-space-astronaut-photos-2016.html">Space.com</a>, and some incredible images have been captured from up there over the years. But this is one of the greatest, allowing you to see both the unnatural lights of New York City, as well as the gorgeous green Northern Lights.</p>

<p>The video was just shared again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051509/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/5kwhgu/the_northeast_corridor_from_the_international/">on Reddit</a>, but it appears to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051509/http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a14031/nasa-iss-video-northern-lights-touch-sunrise/">from last year</a>, when ISS commander Butch Wilmore captured &quot;the aurora eclipsing the sunrise.&quot;</p>

<p>Did you know that, because of its large size, you can see the Space Station, too? Mission Control at NASA&#x2019;s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas updates their website weekly after they determine &quot;sighting opportunities for over 6,700 locations worldwide.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101051509/https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/">You can check that here</a> (and they note that if you don&apos;t see your city or town, &quot;the space station is visible for a long distance around each of the listed locations&quot;).</p>
