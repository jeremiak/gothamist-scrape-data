As the sun set on the summer of 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313071353/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/01/mccarren_4.php">that party had ended</a>, and concert-goers were forced over to the much more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313071353/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/13/pool_parties_move_to_waterfront.php#photo-1">militantly-run</a> East River Park for the annual &quot;Pool Parties.&quot; It was officially the end of an era... or the return of a past era, depending on how long you&apos;ve lived in the neighborhood. Plans for the comeback of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313071353/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/11/mccarren_park_pool_presented_to_com.php">a working community pool</a> were drawn up, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313071353/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/07/mccarren_groundbreaking.php#photo-1">the ground was broken</a>. Things were dodgy there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313071353/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/10/is_mccarren_park_scary.php">for a while</a>, but now this summer the $50 million plan will finally become a reality... though we don&apos;t see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313071353/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/03/dodgeball_tom.php">Dodgeball Tom Memorial Court</a> anywhere in these new photos. <em>Not even a statue.</em></p>

<p>On June 28th McCarren Park Pool will make its return, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313071353/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2012/03/mccarren-park-pool-set-to-reopen-june.html">Geoffrey Croft</a> reports that the &quot;facility boasts a 37,9500-square-foot pool, which will accommodate 1,500 swimmers and eight 25-meter lap lanes; a beach; spray showers; and a restored year-round recreation center with a gym, basketball court, weight room, dance studio, cardio room, and multipurpose community space. Wood panels recycled from the Coney Island boardwalk are among the decorative features. The once-glorious diving pool has been replaced by a beach volleyball court.&quot;</p>
