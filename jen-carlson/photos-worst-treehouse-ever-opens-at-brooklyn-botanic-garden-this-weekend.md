The project, called Sandy Remix, will open to the public this Saturday... so you have a couple of days to lower your expectations.</p>

<p>It gives us no joy to burn people who just want to create special things for strangers, but it&apos;s our duty to report on the cold, hard truths of this world. And the fact is, this isn&apos;t a treehouse. A treehouse is defined as: &quot;a small house, especially one for children to play in, built or placed up in the branches of a tree.&quot; And when dealing with things of precious, childhood dreams, you better not jerk us around. So don&apos;t market a treehouse unless you plan on delivering a magical freaking <em>treehouse</em>, <strike>Dad</strike> Botanic Garden.</p>

<p>After seeing the photos of the so-called treehouse, disappointed Gothamist staffers expressed a range of outrage and derision:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;That looks like what you&apos;d get when your drunk dad tells you he&apos;s going to build you a treehouse.&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://twitter.com/johndelsignore">John Del Signore</a>
</li><li>&quot;Jesus, I could throw a treehouse in a woodchipper and it&apos;d spit out something better than that pile of crap. You&apos;re telling me in a borough chock full of artisanal treehouse makers, this is the best you could do?&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a>
</li><li>&quot;Aren&apos;t treehouses supposed be up in the trees, not just made of trees? I guess my computer sits on a treehouse, and I also put my clothing in a treehouse. But assuming we accept this potpourri of mangled tree corpses resting on sea level as a treehouse, this is the kind of treehouse that Grendel makes in the middle of a dark forest so a lost colony of peat farmers stumble upon it and make it their home for a fortnight, laughing by the fire, singing songs, cheering to their good fortune of finding this abandoned bit of shelter until Grendel just nips the opening closed and swallows the whole thing. I would not play in this treehouse, unless you want to be inside of some human <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://candy.about.com/od/kidfriendlytreats/r/turtles.htm">turtle candy recipe</a>.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a>
</li><li>&quot;The piece looks more like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/visiting_sesame_street.php?gallery0Pic=7#photo-2">Big Bird&apos;s alley nest</a> after an all night rager.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen Carlson</a>
</li><li>&quot;It looks like a crow taught a drunk Paul Bunyan how to build a nest.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://twitter.com/yenbakas">Ben Yakas</a>
</li><li>&quot;It looks like what would happen if you gave a giant some meth, some wood, some glue, and five minutes to do something with it.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen Carlson</a>, again
</li><li>&quot;I thought it was supposed to be wood from a house that got hit by Hurricane Sandy, not a treehouse that looks like it was hit by Hurricane Sandy, amirite?&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140024/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a>, again</li></ul>

<p>If you plan to visit, be prepared for your inner child&#x2014;<em>who maybe has never been in a treehouse and was really looking forward to this</em>&#x2014;to throw a massive tantrum upon seeing the finished product, which by now you know, <em>isn&apos;t even in a tree</em>. </p>
