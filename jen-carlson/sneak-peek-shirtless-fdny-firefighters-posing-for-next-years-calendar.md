</div></div>					<p>Yesterday the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509215705/http://gothamist.com/tags/fdny">FDNY</a> released some behind-the-scenes photos from their 2014 calendar shoot. We don&apos;t bust out the Full Size Gallery Function for nothing around here, but this is precisely what it was made for. Click through for a look at the good looking men that heroically save us every day and still have time to work on their abs.</p>

<p>When we reached out to an FDNY rep for more info, we were told, &quot;You are like a shark with blood in the water when we post about the calendar, huh?&quot; (A: Yes.) We were also promised video from the shoot in the near future, so stay tuned for that.</p>
