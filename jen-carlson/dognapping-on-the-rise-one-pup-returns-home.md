										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="dognapping0410.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072651im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/dognapping0410.jpg" width="175" height="251" class="image-left"> </span>On April 13th a 4-year-old Cocker Spaniel named Thompy was stolen from a Boerum Hill Deli. His human, Jon Crawford-Phillips, had tied him outside when he dropped into the establishment around 8:30 that night. </p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the pup&apos;s story has a happy ending. Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072651/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/18/dtg_thompyfound_2010_04_30_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that Crawford-Phillips conducted a stakeout in Red Hook after a tipster mentioned seeing the dog being walked in the neighborhood. Upon seeing Thompy with his own eyes, he called the police and they approached the dog&apos;s new owner, who allegedly bought him on a street 10 days earlier. The new owners wouldn&apos;t say where or from whom they purchased the dog, however. </p>

<p>Maybe <em>now</em> people will think twice about leaving their dogs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072651/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/29/are_dognappings_on_the_rise.php">tied up on the street</a>, even if it&apos;s just for 30 seconds? Crawford-Phillips says, &#x201C;[My family and I] are going to be much more vigilant. I already thought that we were being safe and careful, but we have to be more aware if there&#x2019;s a guy out there trying to take dogs.&#x201D; Recently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072651/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23817557/">Today Show</a> looked at the recent rise in dognappings, and what to do to avoid becoming a victim. Rule #4: &quot;Never leave your dog tied up outside a store or restaurant.&quot;</p>
