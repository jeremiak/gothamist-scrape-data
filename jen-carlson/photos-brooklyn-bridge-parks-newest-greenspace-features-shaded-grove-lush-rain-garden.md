					<p>The next section of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208203301/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynbridgepark">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a>&apos;s waterfront landscape to be developed is Pier 5. While a majority of that pier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208203301/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/photos_pier_5_opens_in_brooklyn_bri.php#photo-1">is already built out</a>&#x2014;with a fishing pier, soccer fields, and an area for grilling&#x2014;the section further from the river has now transformed. It&apos;s not open to the public yet&#x2014;we were told last week that the estimated opening is midsummer 2017&#x2014;by the change is already pretty significant. </p>

<p>While it was once flat and paved, the area is now a rolling green landscape. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208203301/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/blog/park-updates/construction-update-pier-5-uplands">BBP noted</a> in a previous update, &quot;a new sound-attenuating berm&quot; has been built to diminish the BQE traffic noise, adding &quot;4.6 acres of green space to the park and several new features for visitors to enjoy including expansive new lawns, shaded seating areas, winding paths and a multi-level boathouse with public restrooms.&quot; </p>

<p>The area will also feature &quot;a shaded grove&quot; and &quot;lush rain garden,&quot; which sounds pretty lovely&#x2014;though while they promise &quot;it will provide a quiet contrast to the lively Picnic Peninsula nearby,&quot; we&apos;re guessing it will be just as crowded as the rest of the park has become during the summer months.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208203301/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/brooklyn_bridge_park_goats.php">goats were used</a> to clear the berm at Pier 3, they went a less cute way for this one. &quot;To prevent erosion and weed growth, the berm has been planted with a cover crop [of] oats... the roots will hold the berm&#x2019;s shape and prevent weed growth during construction.&quot;</p>

<p>Click through for a look at the area taking shape now. And someone please start a petition for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208203301/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/nyc_needs_more_hammocks.php">a hammock grove</a>. </p>

<p>Other things in the works at the park: Pier 3, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208203301/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/22/squibb_bridge_lawsuit.php">the cursed Squibb Pedestrian Bridge</a>. According to a parks spokesman, the bridge will reopen this spring, nearly three years after it closed.</p>
