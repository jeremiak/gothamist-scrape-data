</div></div>					<p>As an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183635/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/27/taylor_swift_nyc_nye.php">ambassador of New York City</a>, Taylor Swift should be getting to know how the rest of us saps live. Maybe she could take up residence in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183635/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/14/how_to_live_in_a_90-square-foot_apa.php">micro-apartment</a> or something, at least for a little while, during this difficult time when her $19 million Tribeca penthouse gets renovated and probably cleansed with smoldering sage following her last break-up.</p>

<p>But while we may want to know how the other half lives, the other half is certainly not interested in how we live&#x2014;so instead of hitting up Craigslist for a rental in the Cemetery Belt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183635/http://www.tmz.com/2016/06/13/taylor-swift-nyc-rental/">Swift has rented</a> a $40,000/month, four-story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183635/http://cenews.com/article/8353/expanding_a_new_landmark__the_">carriage house in the West Village</a>. A New York City carriage house is the New York City real estate dream, so who can really blame her.</p>

<p>The four-floor home, built in 1912, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183635/http://ny.curbed.com/2013/4/8/10256088/peeking-at-the-penthouse-of-a-cornelia-street-carriage-house">was owned</a> by Soho House chief technology officer David Aldea, and maybe it still is? Maybe he comes with the rental? Maybe he&apos;s just always chilling by the indoor pool? Because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209183635/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3682441">it does have an indoor pool</a>. Ugh, this article is over. Click through for a look and then burn your eyes with smoldering sage to forget this kind of living exists.</p>
