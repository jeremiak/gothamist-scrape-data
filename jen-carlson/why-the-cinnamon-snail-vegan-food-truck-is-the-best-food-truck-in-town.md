</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123234/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/24/finally_the_cinnamon_snail_vegetari.php#photo-1">nearly a year</a> of drooling from a distance, we finally got to try the Cinnamon Snail food truck&apos;s vegan offerings. When it surfaced within walking distance of Gothamist HQ, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123234/https://twitter.com/johndelsignore/status/255311510660861953">started the day right</a> with $42 worth of donuts and assorted breakfast sweets, then returned for lunch. Here&apos;s what we were left dreaming of last night: </p>

<p><strong>The Mexican Hot Chocolate Glazed Twist</strong> ($3): Our inner monologue went straight up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123234/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-4P1WPE-Qg">Homer Simpson</a> when we bit into this thing. It&apos;s PERFECT. If you see them in the truck, buy one... <em>buy them all</em>. The even balance of the spicy seasoning and sweet glaze almost brought a tear to our eyes. As Ricky Fitts once declared: &quot;Sometimes there&apos;s so much beauty in the world I feel like I can&apos;t take it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>French Mustard Seitan Cashew Cheese Tarts</strong> ($4): We ordered this as an afterthought and didn&apos;t try it until we were about to leave the office, at which point three Gothamist staffers dug in and declared it a favorite. The savory item features all of the aforementioned ingredients and has a Level 4 Drool Factor.</p>

<p><strong>The Cinnamon Snail Cinnamon Bun</strong> ($3): This one is for sharing, as it is <em>huge</em> (and fun to pull apart). This won&apos;t taste too different from your typical cinnamon roll&#x2014;and would you even want it to? It&apos;s sweet, delicious, doughy and quite a deal at 3 bucks!</p>

<p><strong>Korean Smoked Chili Sausage &amp; Potato Sub</strong> ($9): This spicy special also featured arugula, kimchi, and pickled mango aioli on a grilled baguette. Garth Johnston tried this one out, and says, &quot;It was very tasty and didn&apos;t taste &apos;vegan&apos; at all to this meat eater. Some people in the office thought it was spicy but I thought it was just right. In fact, I couldn&apos;t stop thinking about it all day.&quot; Also: FILLING.</p>

<p><strong>The Gochujang Burger Deluxe</strong> ($10): This was mentioned as a favorite in our recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123234/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/05/five_best_veggie_burgers.php">best veggie burgers list</a> (and also at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123234/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/09/cinnamon_snail.php#photo-1">the Vendys</a>), but yesterday was the first time we got to try it ourselves. The burger is MASSIVE and messy, but worth every seitan stain on our clothes. It features: sauteed kimchi, arugula, pickled daikon and leeks, black sesame gomasio and sriracha mayonnaise on herb grilled focaccia. If you get one, you won&apos;t need to eat for the rest of the day.</p>
