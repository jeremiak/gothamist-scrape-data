<p>On the inside, the owners had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509073026/http://playlandmotel.com/?page_id=37">twelve different artists</a> design the rooms&#x2014;one is painted like a murder scene, another has a Tee Pee for a bed, etc.&#x2014;which go for around $250 a night (weekdays this is about $50 less). But you don&apos;t need to be some <em>high rolling</em> overnight guest to enjoy the place: there&apos;s a restaurant, a bar, and a little fake beach. There you&apos;ll find a deejay, a game of cornhole, an inflatable pool, and and a giant white wall that will eventually be home to projections and movies. </p>

<p>Photographer Tod Seelie dropped by last weekend to check the scene out, and tells us the crowd was &quot;very attractive. On the younger side. Seemed to be a decent mix of visitors and locals.&quot; But on weekdays the place has a more local crowd (&quot;the night before had been mostly local firemen&quot;). He added: &quot;People seemed really friendly, much more so than an average New Yorker is used to...&quot; but surely that will change if we ever start referring to this neighborhood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509073026/http://blog.zagat.com/2013/07/rockaways-new-playland-motel-poor-mans.html">as Rocktauk</a> :(</p>
