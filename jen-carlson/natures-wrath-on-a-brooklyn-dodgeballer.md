First it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707151456/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/15/brooklyn_kickball_vs_brooklyn_trees.php">the Brooklyn Kickballers</a> being scared of the newly planted saplings in McCarren Park, and now <em>this</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707151456/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/07/10/2009-07-10_tree_branch_clocks_brooklyn_man_playing_dodgeball.html">The Daily News</a> reports that 23-year-old Justin Calicchio was playing a game of dodgeball in Carroll Park yesterday when a tree branch came out of nowhere and pinned him to the ground. Yikes. He told the paper from his hospital bed that, &quot;I blacked out. Everything is starting to become clear again. My girlfriend has been telling me about it and I&apos;m starting to remember now.&quot; He is suffering from back injuries but was told he barely dodged more serious problems. A friend reported back saying the branch was too big and fell too fast that there was no escaping it. Calicchio has lived in Carroll Gardens his whole life, and says the tree has always been there, and &quot;branches have fallen off before.&quot; Paging the Parks Department!</p>
