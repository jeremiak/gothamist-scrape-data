<p>Seriously, when will it end? Yesterday we received an email announcing that Deitch Projects was presenting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142844/http://gothamist.com/tags/shepardfairey">Shepard Fairey</a> Ace Hotel Special Package and Installation. Really! In conjunction with his MAYDAY show (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142844/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/shepard_faireys_mural_is_now_done.php">and billboard</a> on Houston Street, and presumably his clothing line&apos;s pop-up shop on the LES), Sir Fairey will also wheatpaste over 80 feet of plywood wrapping around the hotel. And there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142844/http://www.acehotel.com/newyork#packages">room deals</a> and limited edition t-shirts and <em>whatever</em>. We were happy to ignore this, but then today we got another email announcing that Shepard Fairey had taken over the walls of Music Hall of Williamsburg, too&#x2014;and now we&apos;re sort of scared that he&apos;s coming for <em>us</em>.</p>

<p>In the latest email it was announced to us that: &quot;Over the weekend, contemporary artist and illustrator Shepard Fairey took over the upstairs bar area at the Music Hall and created a one of a kind permanent installation of two murals on adjoining walls. Listening to a playlist including Metallica, Fugazi, and Band of Horses, Fairey&#x2019;s pasted posters feature images demonstrating his disdain for the dysfunctional democracy and the need for campaign finance reform.&quot; (Weird, Band of Horses is totally on our campaign finance reform playlist, too!)</p>

<p>The wheatpaste is spreading, friends&#x2014;try not to inhale.</p>
