</div></div>					<p>The Hamptons? So lamestream. This year you&apos;ll want to summer on the Lower East Side&apos;s Grand Street. Your home for the season is located in the shadows of the Williamsburg Bridge, and is within walking distance of the scenic East River <em>and</em> Doughnut Plant. Plus, when you&apos;re inside, it kind of looks like you&apos;re on a boat? Which is neat.</p>

<p>The home is for rent for the summer only (July 1st Thru Labor Day for $8,500. Either month alone for $4,250, or both July &amp; August for $8,000.).  For that kind of cash, you&apos;ll get a private deck, a garden, two floors, a fireplace, and all the other regular apartment stuff (a bathroom! etc). From the Landmarks Preservation Commission:</p>

<blockquote>Built ca. 1827-28 as an investment property by James Lent and Henry Barclay, the rowhouse at 511 Grand Street is a remarkable, rare surviving example of the Federal-style house in Manhattan. Shaped by the irregular foot print of the lot, 511 Grand Street is 291&#x2044;2 feet wide with an extra bay on the west side. Although the fac&#x327;ade has been altered, the building still retains significant elements of its original Federal style such as its original 21&#x2044;2-story height, peaked roof, pedimented dormers and brick chimney and side entrance. Located on Grand Street, a busy thoroughfare, a succession of tenants since the 1840s has used 511 Grand Street as home and place of business. The survival of 511 Grand Street and its neighbor 513 Grand Street in an area heavily altered in the nineteenth century to accommodate the increasing population of the Lower East Side and in the twentieth century by urban renewal is significant to the understanding of the development of the area.</blockquote>

<p>The home (located at 511 Grand Street) was built in 1829, and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150901062131/http://www.bondnewyork.com/Lower-East-Side-Chinatown/Apartment/Manhattan-NY/834637">described as</a> &quot;a historic farmhouse&quot; owned by &quot;two prominent American artists&quot;... who are probably going to be summering in the Hamptons.</p>

<p>Those artists are Inka Essenhigh and Stephen Mumford, who purchased the now-landmarked home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150901062131/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2011/07/historic-townhouse-511-grand-street-sold-for-1-36-million.html">in 2011</a> for $1.36 million.
