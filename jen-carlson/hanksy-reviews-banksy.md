<p><em>This is what we call &quot;flooding the zone&quot;&#x2014;for our latest Banksy in NYC coverage, we reached out to the New York-based street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191807/https://twitter.com/HanksyNYC">Hanksy</a> to get his take on his almost-namesake&apos;s most recent work. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191807/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s open air street art show began yesterday when he put a piece up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191807/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/banksys_back_in_nyc_for_octoberfirs.php#photo-1">on Allen Street</a>, which was followed by a new one today on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191807/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/new_banksy_on_the_westside.php#photo-1">West 25th Street</a>. This is planned to go on all month long, with&#x2014;presumably&#x2014;a new piece going up each day.</em> </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s no secret that Banksy stole my street handle and has basically been riding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191807/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/12/photos_hanksy_gets_his_first_galler.php">my graffiti coattails</a> for the last few years, but alas I hold no grudges. Seeing as how I consider myself a shitty artist at best, it&apos;s always pleasant to see fun and competent work springing up on the street. And the fact that it&apos;s in the city I love by the genre&apos;s cr&#xE8;me de la cr&#xE8;me, makes it all that much more exciting. The toll free number on his first Chinatown appearance was an excellent touch and the simple cheekiness of the Westside tag is what I love about his more recent work. This will be a fun month-long ride, both for his haters and lovers alike. I can honestly say I&apos;m looking forward to it.&quot; &#x2014; Hanksy</p>
