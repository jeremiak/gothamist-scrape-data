<p>Hey Know-it-alls, have you seen these interactive maps that make you race to identify the correct New York City neighborhood locations before your time gets to an embarrassingly high tourist level? You can start with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063337/http://click-that-hood.com/?city=manhattan">Manhattan</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063337/http://click-that-hood.com/?city=brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, but those are too easy. Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063337/http://click-that-hood.com/?city=queens">Queens</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063337/http://click-that-hood.com/?city=bronx">The Bronx</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063337/http://click-that-hood.com/?city=staten-island">Staten Island</a> for a real challenge. Actually, the real challenge might be correcting the maps: Bushwick South? Bushwick North? <em>Bedford</em>?</p>
