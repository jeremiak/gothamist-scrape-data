<p>The 34-year-old artist was in the middle of creating a piece as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210153006/http://thirteen.org/nyvoices">New York Voices</a> documented his process. The cops saw him, tagged him as a graffiti artist, and took him in. After spending 17 hours in jail the charges were dropped -- but the story doesn&apos;t end there. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210153006/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0805,tucker,78874,2.html">The Village Voice</a> is reporting that Gallagher filed a notice of claim last week, with a plan to sue the city for false arrest, unlawful imprisonment, and pain and suffering. The lawsuit is set to the tune of $5 Million, something Gallagher doesn&apos;t expect to receive -- he does, however, hope to prove a point. </p>

<p>He points out that he wants &quot;peace of mind&#x2014;no fear of arrest or harassment, freedom of expression, knowing that I can go to sleep at night doing what I do without fear of being incarcerated.&quot; He works in a water-soluble medium that many would agree should be legal (seriously, stores sell sidewalk chalk!), and his lawyer states that it is, in fact, &quot;perfectly legal&quot;. Gallagher adds that, &quot;I think [the NYPD] should reassess their priorities and not waste taxpayer dollars on policing people for chalking sidewalks.&quot; </p>

<p>While Gallagher isn&apos;t the only one they&apos;re busting for chalk crimes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210153006/http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/04/kinberg_0410">in 2004</a> Joshua Kinberg landed in the NYPD&apos;s secret protest group files for his chalk art bike), they have continued to target him. Soon after he was jailed, he was busted again outlining a shadow in Boreum Hill. <em>Scandalous!</em> Does the city need to take another look at what constitutes graffiti? We think so. </p>
