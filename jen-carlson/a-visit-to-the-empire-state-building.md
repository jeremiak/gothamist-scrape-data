</div></div>					<p>Did you know that the 103rd floor of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083328/http://gothamist.com/tags/empirestatebuilding">Empire State Building</a> is not open to the public, but <em>is</em> open to celebrities? The space is very small, with a thin walkway going around it and hardly any barrier separating you from the thin air. The barrier only comes up to one&apos;s knees, if that. Yesterday our intrepid photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083328/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> braved the vertigo-inducing space during a VIP tour of the iconic building... and you won&apos;t see photos like this anywhere else, because most of the other press people were too scared to go outside to experience, or document it! For those who want to get a similar view, we&apos;re told for some extra cash the general public can visit the 102nd floor, which is closed in and significantly less scary.</p>

<p>The landmark is currently undergoing a more than $550 million renovation, and the ol&apos; gal is looking better than ever. A few improvements, and other tidbits we were told about: </p>

<ul><li>People no longer have to wait on line in the basement of the building.
</li><li>There&apos;s a new gift shop!
</li><li>Sunbursts are now a theme throughout the building. 
</li><li>The color of the employee&apos;s uniforms were made specifically to match the color of the marble in the walls.
</li><li>There are large digital screens in the middle of the waiting lines where people can learn about how the building is energy efficient.</li></ul>

<p>If you want a look at the building&apos;s past, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083328/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/24/flashback_empire_state_building.php">head over here</a>.</p>
