<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="skahate0411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171705im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/skahate0411.jpg" width="365" height="364" class="image-left"> </span>Ska band Less Than Jake (playing in New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171705/http://vanswarpedtour.com/dates">this summer</a>!) had a run in with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171705/http://gothamist.com/tags/westborobaptistchurch">Westboro Baptist Church</a> this week, according to a press release we just received, along with several reports on the internet. Drummer Vinnie Fiorello says they &quot;have no idea&quot; why they were attacked, and added, &quot;Less Than Jake doesn&apos;t exactly send parents running for cover. The fact that we do have a certain amount of obscenity and are fairly liberal could and obviously did ruffle some Christian feathers.&quot; But... aren&apos;t there bands that are ruffling <em>more</em> Christian feathers than this &apos;90s ska troupe? Is this some sort of publicity stunt for Westboro to win over other ska-haters (aka normal America)?</p>

<p>Maybe not. Fiorello told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171705/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/westboro_baptist_church_protests_outside_less_than_jake_show/">AltPress</a> it most likely just &quot;had to be a slow night at the bible study [that] night.&quot; </p>

<p>Amongst the complaints of the protesters were claims of: &quot;whore mongering, adultery, [and] sin.&quot; But if they&apos;re like us, maybe they should focus their hate on the &quot;whoa whoa&apos;s.&quot;</p>

<p>Either way, at press time, we are still allowed to express our dislike for Let&apos;s Go Bowling and Cherry Poppin&apos; Daddies, which Westboro has been mum about.</p>
