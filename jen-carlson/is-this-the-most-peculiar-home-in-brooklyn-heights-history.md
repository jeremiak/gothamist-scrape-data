<p><strong>UPDATE, 8/19/15:</strong> Much more information on the house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118063843/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/everything_we_know_about_that_stran.php">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a home like this in New York City?</p>

<p>We&apos;re going to file this unique bit of architecture under a History Mystery for now, as we haven&apos;t been able to find much information about it. But we can&apos;t stop staring. These photos, courtesy of the Brooklyn Public Library, are dated March 27th, 1921&#x2014;they note that the home was on Columbia Heights between Pierrepont and Clark in Brooklyn Heights. It is described as an &quot;adobe Spanish-style house with patio.&quot;</p>

<p>The home&#x2014;which is definitely no longer there&#x2014;was likely on the East River side, since there are no buildings showing up behind it. The Promenade wasn&apos;t built at this time, and this home could have very well been torn down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118063843/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/the_brooklyn_promenade.php#photo-1">when Robert Moses came through</a>. (Update below.)</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to a few New York City history experts, and will update as we find out more.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> THIS HOUSE STILL EXISTS. Commenter R.O. Shipman points us towards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118063843/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/2180605">this Corcoran listing</a> for 220 Columbia Heights. It appears the above photos were taken on this property&apos;s roof, though today it appears much of the structure is missing.</p>
