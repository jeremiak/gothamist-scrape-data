</div></div>					<p>When Atlantis&#x2014;which launched for a final time earlier today&#x2014;returns to Earth in a couple of weeks, NASA will retire its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170032/http://gothamist.com/tags/spaceshuttle">shuttle program</a>. Are you feeling nostalgic? Let&apos;s take a look back at some of the great traditions of astronaut food, which will certainly continue as we enter the era of deep-space exploration. Click through for some of our favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170032/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/living/spacefood/">&quot;future foods&quot;</a>, but first, some fun facts:<br>
</p><ul><li>An oven is provided in the space shuttle and the space station to heat foods to the proper temperature. <br>
</li><li>There are no refrigerators in space, so space food must be stored and prepared properly to avoid spoilage, especially on longer missions.<br>
</li><li>Condiments are provided such as ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise. <strong>Salt and pepper are available but only in a liquid form.</strong> This is because astronauts can&apos;t sprinkle salt and pepper on their food in space. <br>
</li><li>On the first moon walk mission, Buzz Aldrin smuggled a vial of wine and some bread to perform the first outer space communion. <br>
</li><li>Russians have over 300 space food items, but there are only 180 items for U.S. astronauts to choose from. Shrimp cocktail is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170032/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-03-10/news/9503130375_1_shrimp-cocktail-astronaut-food-space-foods">a favorite</a> amongst them!<br>
</li><li>The launch control team has a traditional post launch meal, consisting of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170032/http://www.universetoday.com/61939/a-space-shuttle-tradition-thats-full-of-beans/">beans and cornbread</a>. They&apos;ve been enjoying this after each successful launch, and today was no different.<br>
</li><li>And yes, you can even use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170032/http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/food/space-shuttle-food-secrets-2508625/#photoViewer=3">chopsticks</a>!</li></ul><p></p>
