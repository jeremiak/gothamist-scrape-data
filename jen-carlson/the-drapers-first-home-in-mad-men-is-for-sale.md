</div></div>					<p>Don and Betty Draper&apos;s very first home in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027050133/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> was in Ossining, NY. Throughout the series, the home that was used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027050133/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/05/the_drapers_1st_home_in_mad_men_is.php">was located in Pasadena, California</a>. However, in the pilot, a home in New Rochelle, NY was used&#x2014;and that&apos;s what&apos;s on the market for $1.15 million right now. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027050133/http://curbed.com/archives/2015/06/24/mad-men-house-for-sale-architecture.php">Curbed</a> notes that the house, circa 1914, &quot;is a classic clapboard colonial with handsome black shutters and a fire engine-red front door&quot; (the Pasadena version was green with a red door).</p>

<span class="photo_caption">Don arriving home at the end of the <em>Mad Men</em> pilot</span></p>

<p>The 3,544-square-foot home is located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027050133/https://www.google.com/maps/@40.932128,-73.787968,3a,75y,2.74h,86.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s00h_EnHS9n2zkI_AvboN-w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">90 Forest Avenue</a>, and features six bedrooms, a picturesque porch, a garage, and other suburban features that we choose to believe will never bring happiness. Just look at the Drapers! But if you&apos;re into that white picket fence American Dream thing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027050133/http://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng/sales/detail/180-l-1006-45fke8/classic-center-hall-colonial-new-rochelle-ny-10804">hit up Sotheby&apos;s</a>.</p>
