The casts of <em>30 Rock</em> and <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, both taking part in the WGA strike (as the actors are also writers), are bringing their shows to the stage. Each will perform new episodes live, in the small 150-seat theater -- <em>30 Rock</em> on Monday the 19th and <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on Saturday, of course.</p><blockquote>the stage version of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> has been kept something of a secret. It&apos;s not clear who will get a chance to buy tickets and when they&apos;ll be on sale. The guest host will be <em>Superbad</em> star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154217/http://jezebel.com/gossip/snap-judgment/superbad-star-michael-cera-barely+legal-crush-of-the-day-289319.php">Michael Cera</a>, sources told The Post.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154217/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2007/11/cera-to-host-sa.html">Cera was invited</a> to host by SNL and UCB member Amy Poehler and won&apos;t be meeting with the cast until a few hours before the show! Good thing he has an improv background. Alas, it appears <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154217/http://www.ucbtheatre.com/schedule/showdetails.php?showid=1585">advanced reservations have been filled</a>, however we&apos;d suggest keeping an eye on the venue&apos;s site. A limited amount of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154217/http://www.ucbtheatre.com/schedule/showdetails.php?showid=1584">tickets for <em>30 Rock</em></a> will be available at the door the night of (getting in line now wouldn&apos;t be a bad idea). Each show is $20, with proceeds going to the Writers Guild strike fund -- and according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154217/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/15/john_oliver_wri.php">to John Oliver</a>, they sure could use some snacks down on the picket line.<p></p>
