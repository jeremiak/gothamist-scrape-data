The collection features iconic images of legends like David Bowie, John Lennon, and The Rolling Stones. But why? Baldwin told us this afternoon, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044904/http://www.rockpaperphoto.com/">Jody Britt</a> is a very old friend of mine. I am a fan of her dad&apos;s work and the work of several of the photographers in the collection. Rock and roll photography was an essential part of that whole period of my life. I mean, who didn&apos;t have a Beatles poster in their bedroom? Who didn&apos;t have Robert Plant, Dylan, the Stones, Hendrix, Santana, Yes, the Who, the Dead, the Doors, you name it, on some wall?&quot;</p>

<p>As for seeing those bands back in the day, Baldwin said he saw &quot;Zeppelin in DC in &apos;77 [years after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044904/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/led_zep_flashback.php"><em>The Song Remains The Same</em> was filmed</a>], and The Who at the Garden in &apos;74. Memory is blurry, but the train ride to the Garden was... exhilarating.&quot;</p>
