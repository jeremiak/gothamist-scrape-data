<p>It looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141035/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">the Hotel Chelsea</a> is still having its soul slowly exorcised. The legendary hotel is now in the hands of real estate investor Joseph Chetrit, who already got rid of any character <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141035/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/11/hotel_chelsea_lobby.php">in the lobby</a> earlier this year, and is now gutting the rooms. When we visited with longtime proprietor Stanley Bard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141035/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/17/a_conversation.php">in 2007</a>, he told us stories about decorating each room, some of which were designed by his daughter (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141035/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenc/829966037/">this pink one</a>). But alas, all of that history is now vanishing. </p>

<p>Resident and author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210141035/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/01/ed_hamilton_aut.php">Ed Hamilton</a> posted the above photo on Facebook, writing: &quot;This is the remains of American writer Thomas Wolfe&apos;s last residence in New York City. Where he worked on <em>You Can&apos;t Go Home Again</em>, in 1938.&quot; Well, that&apos;s fitting.</p>

<p>We reached out to Hamilton for an update on the resident situation at the hotel, and he told us, &quot;they are trying to get out as many tenants as possible.&quot; He also sent along this other view of Wolfe&apos;s suite:</p>
