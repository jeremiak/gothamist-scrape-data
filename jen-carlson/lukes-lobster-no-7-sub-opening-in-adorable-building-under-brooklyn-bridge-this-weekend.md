<p>Luke&apos;s Lobsters and No. 7 Sub have just announced that their grand opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023000432/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/brooklyn_bridge_park_adds_new_conce.php">in Brooklyn Bridge Park</a> will be this coming Monday (a.k.a. Memorial Day). Hurrah! Their joint concession stand will be inside of the historic Smokestack Building under the Brooklyn Bridge. And this isn&apos;t just for the summer: they&apos;ll be open 7 days a week, all year round.</p>

<p>In an email today, they explained that No. 7 will serve from the street-side window and Luke&apos;s from the river side&#x2014;there will be 10 tables and 20 chairs to start, but they promise more to come. And good news for DUMBO residents, they will make large office deliveries, and promise regular delivery in the future. They&apos;ve got some solid hours, to boot: Luke&apos;s will stay open two hours later than No. 7, with hours of 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>
