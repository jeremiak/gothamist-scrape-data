</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ll present today&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010436/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">Flashback</a> without much comment. Here&apos;s a look back at New York City from the late 1970s to mid-1980s, when everything was so gloriously gritty. The photos will bring you from the Garment District to Alphabet City&#x2014;and there&apos;s even an appearance by the Astor Place cube. (Warning: the last photo may not be SFW.)</p>
