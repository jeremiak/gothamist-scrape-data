On that note, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140233/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/01/15/2010-01-15_body_washes_up_on_new_yorks_plum_island_site_of_government_disease_lab.html">the Daily News</a> reports that a tall, white male with extremely long fingers has washed up on the medical testing site&apos;s shore. A security guard discovered the partially decomposed body yesterday in a restricted access area, and an autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death, but no trauma was noticed. Conspiracy theorists: maybe the long-fingered man didn&apos;t wash up on the shore, maybe he was trying to escape!</p>
