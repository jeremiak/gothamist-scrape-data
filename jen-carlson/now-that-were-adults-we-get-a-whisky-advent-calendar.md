<p>Over the weekend Patton Oswalt tweeted about getting a 17 year-old DoubleWood Balvenie from his Whisky Advent Calendar. We assumed this calendar was something someone made for him or something only celebrities could get their hands on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154940/http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/drinks-by-the-dram/the-whisky-advent-calendar/">BUT IT&apos;S REAL</a>, and you can buy it with your own non-famous money. It <em>is</em> a little pricey (just under $250), but it allows you to start every day... end every day?&#x2014;however you roll&#x2014;with 1 oz of good whisky. And spoiler: behind one door is a 50 year old single malt Scotch.</p>
