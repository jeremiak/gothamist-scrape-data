title: Charlie Sheen Is Losing At Ticket Sales (And Probably Other Stuff)

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sheenloser0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sheenloser0311.jpg" width="365" height="418" class="image-left"> </span>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/charlie_sheen_3.php">we&apos;ve been saying</a> all along, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549/http://gothamist.com/tags/charliesheen">Charlie Sheen</a>&apos;s shows at Radio City Music Hall <em>never sold out</em>, despite what the NY Post, TMZ, and other outlets have been reporting. Ever since they&apos;ve gone on sale it&apos;s been possible to buy tickets via Ticketmaster (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1D00466FFC3A65BE?artistid=1568566&amp;majorcatid=10002&amp;minorcatid=51">see for yourself</a>)... which has those who bought in bulk hoping to turn a profit in rough shape. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/03/28/2011-03-28_charlie_sheen_not_winning_when_it_comes_to_shows_ticket_sales_sellers_desperate_.html">the Daily News</a>, there are more than 2,800 seats for Sheen&apos;s upcoming New York shows available on StubHub, and plenty more on Craigslist going for below face value. Maybe the MaSheen should consider having <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/11/this_is_happening_lcd_soundsystem_t.php">LCD Soundsystem</a> open (or headline!) his shows.</p>

<p>A local broker told the paper, &quot;I&apos;m worried. I need him to do something else stupid so I can unload all these tickets. I guarantee we&apos;re going to take a loss.&quot; He purchased 85 tickets and has only moved 10 so far. Another broker who purchased $1,500 worth of tickets has only sold <em>one</em>, below face value, and says &quot;no one wants to go.&quot; Needless to say, he&apos;s no longer a Sheen fan, saying, <strong>&quot;if I opened the newspaper tomorrow and saw that he was dead, my first reaction wouldn&apos;t be &apos;Darn, I really liked his movies.&apos; It would be &apos;Sweet! I get my money back from Ticketmaster.&apos;&quot;</strong> Always knew scalpers had hearts of gold.</p>

<p>Sheen&apos;s spokesperson refused to comment on the sold-out claims when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549/http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/03/29/sheen.tickets.ew/">CNN</a> came calling. Or maybe his team is just too busy trying to find Sheen lodging for his tour&#x2014;hotels have banned him in New York, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120527105549/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/hotels_cold_shoulder_charlie_24hfLxTylYlocyU0nUJhyJ">Page Six</a>, and he&apos;s now allegedly looking to rent a private residence here.</p>
