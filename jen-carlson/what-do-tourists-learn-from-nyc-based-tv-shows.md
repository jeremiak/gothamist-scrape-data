                            <p>An out-of-towner who has never stepped foot in New York City has compiled a list of what she&apos;s learned about the Big Apple from television, saying, <strong>&quot;I&apos;ve watched enough television set in New York to have learned some of what to expect when I finally make it there.&quot;</strong> Oddly, she doesn&apos;t mention all of the oversized 2-bedroom rent-controlled apartments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128043357/http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Monica%27s_Apartment">available in Manhattan</a>... but click through for a glimpse at what television <em>has</em> taught her. And then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128043357/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us</a> your own list of what television has taught you about the country beyond our city&apos;s borders&#x2014;we&apos;ll pick the top answers and post them here tomorrow. Stay tuned...
