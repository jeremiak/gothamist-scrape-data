One couple (and there&apos;s more than one!) in their 30s recently left their 1.5 bdrm Sunset Park apartment (and $1300/month rent) for the greener pastures of the upstate city, where they enjoy their new rent of $795/month. Just what does one get for that price? Three-bedrooms, living room, dining room, basement, a front and back porch, stained-glass windows, and a separate office...on a tree lined street...400 miles away from what used to be their city of dreams. One of the Buffalonians had this to say, <strong>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t miss my old life in New York. I only miss the life in New York I know I never would have had.&#x201D;</strong> Sad, really, but if you too have dreams of stained glass windows...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414122747/http://buffalo.craigslist.org/rea">there&apos;s plenty available</a>.</p>
