Since then she&apos;s been soundtracking shows like The O.C., Grey&apos;s Anatomy and Gossip Girl -- but her talents extend beyond the small screen. She also just launched her own label, Chop Shop Records; and this year she brings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329074907/http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/filmguide/2008_breaking_the_band.html">Breaking the Band</a> back to the Tribeca Film Festival. The concert takes place at Webster Hall tonight, and features bands like Bad Veins and The Hold Steady.</em>  </p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved with the Breaking the Band show?</strong> In May 2006, Josh Schwartz and I were invited to speak on a panel at Tribeca Film Festival about the music in The O.C. We discussed the soundtrack series, &quot;Bait Shop&quot;, covers created for the show, music in general.  I put together the Festival&apos;s first Breaking The Band showcase as a companion to the panel including some O.C. favorites including Mates Of State, Ted Leo and The Pharmacists, Matt Pond, Nada Surf and special guest Ben Gibbard.  </p>

<p><strong>How did you pick the bands?</strong> So much important and innovative music is coming out of the city these days, I was interested in lining up some great talent from New York.   As the Music Supervisor on Gossip Girl (Josh Schwartz/Stephanie Savage produced), I have been focusing on music created here.</p>

<p><strong>If you could add more New York bands, who would be on the bill?</strong> The National, The Pierces, MGMT, Yeasayer</p>

<p><strong>How did you get started in music supervision?</strong> I was hired by a good friend (Aaron Osborne) to supervise his directorial debut for Roger Corman. The feature, &quot;Caged Heat 3000&quot;, included plenty of women in prison in space and lots of Fu Manchu and The Ape Hangers. I worked on a number of movies for Roger&apos;s company, did a lot of additional low budget feature work and eventually started Chop Shop in &apos;98. </p>

<p><strong>Will Gossip Girl be getting its own &quot;Bait Shop&quot; in the future?</strong> I&apos;ll have to ask Josh and Stephanie, but I would love to book The Bait Shop NYC. We have had on-cameras by The Pierces and Lincoln Hawk.</p>
