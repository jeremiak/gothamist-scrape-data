---

	
										<p>Did our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161753/http://gothamist.com/tags/jaredleto">Jared Leto</a> Fan Club Membership expire? Because no one told us about the former Jordan Catalano busking sans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161753/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCIKg3YREHY">Frozen Embryos</a> (seriously, where&apos;s Tito?) all over New York City. Would have totally skipped school for this! Luckily, co-worker and now Forever Friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161753/http://twitter.com/yenbakas">Ben Yakas</a> spotted the videos below in what he called a &quot;random&quot; YouTube search. Click play, and your eardrums will grow hands, sharpen a shiv out of thin air, and puncture themselves until the noise stops.</p>

<p>Did you see Leto tapping into his acting skills in that one? Holding his hand up and passionately making a fist which he then closes on to his heart? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161753/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/letobusking0513.jpg">That&apos;s the stuff</a>. And here&apos;s Leto acting like he&apos;s a regular ol&apos; big city busker, down in the subway system:</p>

<p>And more more more forever: </p>
