Because doesn&apos;t this rumor happen <em>every</em> year? Well here comes the latest tease that Brooklyn will get its trolley cars back. <p></p>

<p>Last time we heard about this plan (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803141528/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/05/mayor_supports_trolley_comeback.php">last August</a>), it was Mayor Bloomberg that showed interest in bringing some version of the nostalgic modes of transportation back to growing waterfront areas in the borough. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803141528/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/trolley_good_news_for_red_hook_rail_VyUZydkkwcTTWb6BeYh6PO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> reports that the city is on track to build a light-rail or trolley line servicing certain sections of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The first step will come when the Department of Transportation will choose a consultant sometime before summer, who will then look in to a mile-long line from the Red Hook waterfront to the edge of Brooklyn Bridge Park. An additional half-mile line to Borough Hall may be a possibility, too, and will also be determined by the consultant during the 6-month study. Velazquez says the project is important now because the already isolated area of Red Hook is now facing bus service cuts.</p>

<p>Assuming everything runs smoothly, the next step to making this a reality would be securing around $10MM, and then it&apos;ll be smooth sailing, right? We want to believe!</p>
