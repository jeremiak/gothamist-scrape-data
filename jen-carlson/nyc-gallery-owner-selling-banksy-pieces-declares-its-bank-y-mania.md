<p>It&apos;s been nearly one month since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214051117/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> departed our fair city, leaving us with a wide selection of public art that has since been defaced, removed, covered up, confiscated by the NYPD, and sold at auction. Because humans are sometimes terrible and greedy.</p>

<p>The man set to profit the most at this point is New York gallery owner Stephan Keszler, who will sell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214051117/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/banksys_heart_balloon_to_be_sold_in.php">the broken hearted balloon</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214051117/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/new_dramatic_banksy_piece_goes_up_o.php#photo-1">WikiLeaks installation</a> at the Art Miami Fair next month. When the latter was removed from its Lower East Side spot, one of the men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214051117/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php#photo-1">removing it</a> said it was being taken on behalf of the artist. Lies! </p>

<p>Keszler, who stands to make nearly $1 million, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214051117/http://nypost.com/2013/11/23/first-banksy-pieces-from-nyc-residency-up-for-sale/">the NY Post</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s Banksy mania!&quot; But he&apos;s being criticized by others who believe he should have left the public art where it was. His defense? &quot;He acquired the pieces from the building and car owners, adding that he receives calls every day from New Yorkers asking him to buy the Banksy that appeared on their property.&quot; Also, in the end he believes he&apos;s protecting the art from damage, he said while rolling around his pile of gold coins.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Banksy&apos;s publicist for comment on the auctions, and will update if we hear back.</p>
