<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123223/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/is_your_office_filled_with_unhealth.php">we complained</a> about unhealthy snacks around the office, and shortly after a magical delivery appeared: these miniature vegan doughnuts, only delivering up to 25-calories a pop.</p>

<p>Vegan Divas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123223/http://www.thevegandivas.com/shopping/where-to-find.htm">located at</a> 1437 First Avenue (between 75th and 74th Street), offers up these &quot;new guilt-free, bite-size doughnuts... packed with sweet flavors&#x2014;but with only plant-based ingredients.&quot; Flavors include chocolate, cinnamon and Sri Lankan shredded coconut-iced varieties, which contain 20, 25 and 15 calories each, respectively. But how do they taste? Gothamist staffers chime in with mostly positive reviews:</p><ul><li>&quot;Totally delicious. Loved the flavor of the cinnamon one but didn&apos;t really strike me as a doughnut. Was more like a really moist muffin or cake.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Not unpalatable, but very mushy&#x2014;and I suspect whatever chemical process that allows you to make a donut without butter also causes some corresponding toxicity.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Not that there is anything wrong with it, but it wasn&apos;t very doughnut-y. More like ring-shaped pumpkin bread.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;So moist and so low-calorie I would have eaten two dozen of them if my co-workers hadn&apos;t greedily inhaled them all.&quot;</li></ul>The treats are a little pricey, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123223/http://vegandivasnyc.com/assorted-mini-doughnuts-box.aspx">12 minis</a> will set you back $17, and a 12 pack of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123223/http://vegandivasnyc.com/doughnuts.aspx">full size doughnuts</a> cost $36. All of the patisserie&apos;s offerings are cholesterol and lactose-free, devoid of animal products (including dairy, butter, cream, or eggs), and rich in fiber and protein. And if you&apos;re looking for a less-cakey vegan doughnut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123223/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/dun-well_doughnuts_opens_today.php">Dun-Well Doughnuts has perfected the craft</a>.<p></p>
