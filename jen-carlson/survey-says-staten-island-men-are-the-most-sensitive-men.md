<p>Ladies of New York, finding a sensitive man just got easier, look no further than... Staten Island! According to a new survey conducted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194045/http://blog.chemistry.com/2012/01/12/top-ten-cities-to-find-a-sensitive-man/">by Chemistry.com</a>, the borough is the 10th most sensitive city in the United States (falling behind places like Pompano Beach, Florida and Buffalo, New York). The site explains that they used their &quot;data based on the personality types of American singles... to pinpoint the cities with the highest concentrations of softhearted men&#x2014;and you may be surprised by where these gallant gents are residing!&quot; Why yes, color us surprised! </p>

<p>The dating website&apos;s &quot;chief scientific advisor,&quot; Dr. Helen Fisher explained the phenomena further, saying, &#x201C;These 10 cities are packed with a certain kind of man, what I call BUILDERS&#x2014;men who express a constellation of personality traits linked with the serotonin system in the brain. Sensitive men, known as builders, are traditional. <strong>They deeply value loyalty, duty, respectability and proper moral conduct. They want to do the &apos;right&apos; thing.</strong> So builders go way out of their way to keep their social relationships running smoothly. So they watch, listen, and gauge what they need to do to help others and they do it naturally.  It&#x2019;s these chivalrous qualities that make a sensitive man.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Just look at all of these sensitive men awaiting you on the Island. Ladies, they&apos;re just a ferry ride away!
