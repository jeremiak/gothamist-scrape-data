title: Video: More Manhole Explosions!
---

	
										<p>Over the last month we&apos;ve seen a few explosions around the city caught on tape; first a manhole erupting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101141303/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/25/video_manhole_explosion.php">on 29th Street</a>, then a transformer explosion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101141303/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/27/video_more_manhole_explosions.php">at Metrotech in Brooklyn</a>. And today, live from 6th Street (between Avenues A and B), manhole fireworks! This happened just after 4 p.m.</p>

<p>Somewhere under those booms and bangs you can hear someone yell, &quot;I can&apos;t do nothin&apos;!&quot; The cameraman points out this is a Con Ed worker...</p>
