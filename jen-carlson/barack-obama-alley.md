<p>In his autobiography Barack Obama writes about the first night he spent in New York, prior to attending Columbia. Finding no one home at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114420/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/recollections-of-obamas-ex-roommate/">the apartment</a> he was meant to stay at, he &quot;found a dry spot, propped my luggage beneath me and fell asleep, the sound of drums softly shaping my dreams. I woke up to find a white hen pecking at the garbage near my feet. Across the street, a homeless man was washing himself at an open hydrant and didn&apos;t object when I joined him.&quot; </p>

<p>The alleyway Obama slept in, pictured, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114420/http://jschumacher.typepad.com/joe/2009/02/barack-obama-slept-and-washed-here.html">is believed to be</a> adjacent to 200 West 109th Street. Should the unique historical spot be renamed after our new President? Someone get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114420/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/home/home.shtml">the LPC</a> on this!</p>
