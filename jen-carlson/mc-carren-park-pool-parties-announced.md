<p>JellyNYC has finally announced their free Sunday shows at McCarren Park Pool. This could be the last season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118013412/http://thepoolparties.com/">the Pool Parties</a>, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118013412/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/14/mccarren_3.php">the space getting redesigned soon</a> -- so try to soak it all up:</p><blockquote><strong>June 29th:</strong> The Hold Steady, The Loved Ones, J Roddy and the Business<p></p>

<p><strong>July 6th:</strong> Ronnie Spector, The Rabbit Factory Soul Revue, Featuring: Roscoe Robinson, Ralph &#x2018;Soul&#x2019; Jackson, Hermon Hitson and Wiley &amp; The Checkmates</p>
