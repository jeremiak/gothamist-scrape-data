title: Boardwalk Empire Brings Money, Glamour to the City
---

	
										<p>If the mid-century <em>Mad Men</em> aren&apos;t for you, perhaps you&apos;ve been tuning in to HBO on Sunday nights for <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>, the show set in Atlantic City during the Prohibition Era. While New Jersey may be the backdrop, there&apos;s plenty of New York City to be seen&#x2014;and not just in the New York gangsters portrayed on the show. First of all, they&apos;ve been shooting all over the city, and the 1920s boardwalk was actually built in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Check out this timelapse below:</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704194824/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20101010/SMALLBIZ/310109979">Crain&apos;s</a> reports that this once empty lot in Greenpoint&#x2014;previously slated for a luxury condo&#x2014;is not only housing the city&apos;s largest outdoor set ever built (at 300-feet long), but the the city&apos;s most lucrative production. The show&apos;s co-producer, Joe Iberti, told the site, &#x201C;We are the biggest production of the season. In terms of scale and the number of people employed, it&apos;s on the level of a Law &amp; Order and is probably even bigger.&#x201D; Other shots are filmed inside Steiner Studios (and elsewhere in New York, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704194824/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2009/06/16/boardwalk-empire-filming-in-far-rockaway/">Far Rockaway</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704194824/http://www.iwatchstuff.com/2009/07/exclusive_first_sortof_look_at.php">Park Slope</a>), but this one is the centerpiece&#x2014;and it&apos;s being closely guarded from the public behind many, many crates (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704194824/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=2635">ScoutingNY</a> tracked it down).</p>

<p>One Syracuse professor says the set reminds him of &quot;the kind of things they used to build in the golden age of filmmaking in Los Angeles, which has never been done in New York. It&apos;s different than just shooting on the streets of New York, because it&apos;s got the right look, like Law &amp; Order did. This show isn&apos;t just good for employment; it&apos;s glamorous.&#x201D; Take that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704194824/http://celebrity-gossip.net/gossip-girl/taylor-momsen-brooklyn-babe-422291"><em>Gossip Girl</em></a>.
