Upon formation the group got their name from the Bob Dylan lyric, &#x201C;you don&#x2019;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,&#x201D; but unlike the pacifistic folk singer, they were known for their violent campaigns. Following an accidental but fatal explosion at a Greenwich Village townhouse in early 1970, while preparing for bombings at both Fort Dix U.S. Army base and Butler Library at Columbia University, the organization&apos;s members went even further underground, and by the end of that year were on the FBI&apos;s ten most-wanted list. <p></p>

</em><p><em>Currently Rudd is living in New Mexico and telling his story for the first time in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173858/http://www.amazon.com/Underground-My-Life-SDS-Weathermen/dp/0061472751/?tag=gothamist03-20">a new book</a>. He is in town this week for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173858/http://www.markrudd.com/?/book-tour-dates.html">two readings</a>, and yesterday he told us about his decision to leave the group, the Ayers-Obama controversy, and not being able to address the family members of those who died because of the WUO.</em></p>

<p><strong>Growing up in a suburb of New York City, what were some of the things that influenced you back then, and got you looking at the world differently?</strong> Probably it was high school exposure to the beat poets and to the folk song movement, typical stuff for suburban kids at the time who aspired to be intellectuals.  I subscribed to the Village Voice, read the New Republic, which was left-liberal at the time.  </p>

<p><strong>What books, music, activist groups introduced you to/led you down your path?</strong> I listened to Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee, read Kerouac and Ferlinghetti and Ginsberg, of course.  Millions of other white kids at the time had the same influences. I knew no one in the civil rights or peace movements and no one in my suburban synagogue had ever heard of the concept of &quot;tikkun,&quot; to the best of my knowledge.      </p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to finally write a book about the Weatherman?</strong> Two events conspired in 2003 to make me reconsider the book, which was at that point a rough draft in my closet, moldering there for the previous 15 years.  First, the war in Iraq produced an upsurge in young people&apos;s interest about the Vietnam anti-war movement and second, the tremendous response to the &quot;The Weather Underground&quot; documentary made me think I should tell the story.  I started talking with young people who are organizing now and realized that they very much wanted to know what was good organizing and bad.  My story has both.</p>
