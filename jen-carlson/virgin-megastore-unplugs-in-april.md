<p>In 2006 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052527/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/24/goodbye_tower_r.php">Tower Records</a> tumbled, only to be followed by rumors in 2007 of New York&apos;s Virgin Megastores being the next to close up shop. Originally the Union Square outpost was supposed to be closing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052527/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/22/virgin_megastor.php">by February of 2009</a>, but now it&apos;s confirmed that the Times Square one will actually be shutting down first...or as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052527/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01152009/news/regionalnews/virgin_sacrifice_in_times_square_150268.htm">NY Post</a> put is: &quot;come April, there&apos;ll be one less Virgin in Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p>There are 250 employees who have been getting steady paychecks from the store, and one told the paper, &quot;Management has been telling us that we were going to close for years. We&apos;ve all been on edge. We&apos;re all being fired.&quot; Is it time to go all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052527/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5AWi4glHcE"><em>Empire Records</em></a> on management, yet?</p>

<p>All in all, it&apos;s not a huge shocker, as music sales have been on a downward spiral for quite some time. Recently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052527/http://www.nypress.com/blog-3128-cd-sales-down-online-downloads-up-virgin-megastore-death-watch-begins.html">NY Press</a> put the store on a DeathWatch while noting that &quot;disc sales fell nearly 20 percent, to 362.6 million, the seventh decline in eight years, according to SoundScan&apos;s report.&quot;</p>

<p>So what will be able to stay afloat in the 60,000-square-foot space? Forever 21, of course! But don&apos;t get too excited, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052527/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/nyregion/15virgin.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">The NY Times</a> says not to expect to buy any youth-inspired discount clothing until April 2010. In the meantime, Virgin is having a &quot;sacrificial sale&quot; (as pictured).</p>
