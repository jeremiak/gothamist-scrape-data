<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150147/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> ended the season with... well, no spoilers here (we highly recommend the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150147/http://videogum.com/235992/mad-men-s04e13-season-finale/tv/recaps/">Videogum</a> recap, however, if you&apos;ve already watched the finale). This season Don Draper &amp; Co. moved into their new Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce offices&#x2014;and now someone has created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150147/http://www.kratkocasnik.com/blog/2010/10/mad-men-office-floor-plan/">a floorplan</a>, so you an visualize exactly where Peggy is when Don yells for her, or pinpoint where they store all that whiskey. Totally unnecessary (and we&apos;re wondering where Ken Cosgrove&apos;s office is), but amazing nonetheless&#x2014;now someone do this for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150147/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/28/is_this_where_don_draper_lives.php">Don Draper&apos;s apartment</a>, please.
