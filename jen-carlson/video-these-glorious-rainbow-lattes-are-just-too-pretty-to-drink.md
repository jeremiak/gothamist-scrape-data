<p>The first thing you need to know about rainbow lattes is that you probably don&apos;t ever want to drink one. In this case, the food coloring will leave a metallic taste in your mouth. <em>So what is the point even?</em> Uh, by that reasoning, <em>what&apos;s the point of rainbows? </em>The rainbow latte, unlike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133519/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/rainbow_bagels_williamsburg.php">the rainbow bagel</a>, was never meant to be a consumable viral item&#x2014;the colorful method is used in training baristas in latte art. By just using milk, no coffee is wasted in the process.</p>

<p>After seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133519/https://www.instagram.com/ibrewcoffee/">Mason Salisbury&apos;s work</a> (of Sambalatte in Las Vegas), we asked barista <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133519/https://www.instagram.com/caffeine_militia/">Kelsey Forde</a>, at Brooklyn Roasting Co., to make us a few colorful examples. &quot;Make a Prince one!&quot; we demanded. &quot;Now make one WITH coffee!&quot; And since this rainbow trend has <em>got</em> to end (please?), we asked for an all-black, totally goth, post-rainbow latte. </p>

<p>Behold, the beautiful undrinkable* rainbow latte, each one a unique little snowflake.</p>

<p><span class="photo_caption">*Brave videographer Jessica Leibowitz did sample one, and reported back that: &quot;It tasted fine, except for the metallic aftertaste on the tip of the tongue. Would not recommend drinking.&quot; </span></p>
