title: Have You Enjoyed This Twin Peaks Bathroom On The LES Yet?
---

	
										<p>Last year when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010022/http://gothamist.com/tags/missionchinese">Mission Chinese</a> opened on the Lower East Side, its bathroom quickly became the favorite off-menu aspect of the place. Why? It was given the full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010022/http://gothamist.com/tags/twinpeaks"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a> treatment, with a Black Lodge vibe, a portrait of Laura Palmer (that by now has been stolen several times), a healthy dose of <em>red</em> coloring, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010022/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SwvSFOEfHJE">the Angelo Badalamenti theme song</a> hovering in the air... it&apos;s just about perfect:</p>

<p>They&apos;ve also got some Twin Peaks-themed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010022/http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/02/first-look-lower-east-side-cocktails-all-the-drinks-at-mission-chinese-food-slideshow.html#show-303124">cocktails</a>, like the One Eyed Jack, Great Northern, Black Lodge, Damn Fine Cup Of Coffee, and Laura Palmer. Sadly, nothing called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010022/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN7k-KjE8wI">A Fish In The Percolator</a>. </p>

<p>As for why: we have called, asked waitresses, left notes, and called again... but no one&apos;s talking. Maybe if we bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010022/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/agent_dale_cooper_spotted_in_coney.php#photo-1">Agent Dale Cooper</a> there someone will spill.</p>
