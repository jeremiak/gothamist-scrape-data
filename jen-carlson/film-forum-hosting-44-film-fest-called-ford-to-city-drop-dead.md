<p>It&apos;s a big year for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024134218/http://gothamist.com/tags/1970s">1970s NYC</a>, particularly because it&apos;s the 40th anniversary of 1977 and the grim summer it wrought, with the blackout and the Son of Sam murders. The decade as a whole was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024134218/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/20_minutes_in_1970s_nyc.php">a tough one</a> for New Yorkers, who saw a decline in the quality of life, a rise in violent crimes, the spread of crack and heroin, widespread corruption in the NYPD, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024134218/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/21/fear_city_interview_nyc.php">a financial crisis</a>, urban decay, and the perseverance of disco. Even the President of the United States turned his back, denying federal funds to save the city from bankruptcy and resulting in one of the most famous headlines in history: &quot;Ford to City: Drop Dead.&quot;</p>

<p>That Daily News headline is now the title of a film festival coming to Film Forum: <br>
&#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024134218/http://filmforum.org/series/new-york-in-the-70s-series">FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD - NEW YORK IN THE 70</a>,&quot; which will run for 23 days, and screen 44 films from the decade. The Film Forum has just shared the first trailer with Gothamist, noting that &quot;the decline of the city would inspire homegrown filmmakers like Sidney Lumet, John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese, Jerry Schatzberg, along with transplants William Friedkin, Milo&#x161; Forman, John Schlesinger, Gordon Parks Jr., Hal Ashby and Chantal Akerman to create a body of films of gritty intensity that perfectly captured the mood of this chapter in NYC history.&quot;</p>
