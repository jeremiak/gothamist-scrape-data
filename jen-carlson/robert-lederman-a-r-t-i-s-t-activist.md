He founded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527231735/http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nycstreetartists/">A.R.T.I.S.T.</a> (Artists&apos; Response To Illegal State Tactics) in 1993 in order to fight the &quot;legal and political struggle for full First Amendment protection involving the creation, display and sale of art on NYC streets and in Parks.&quot; They&apos;re currently continuing their battle against the Business Improvement District and council member Alan Gerson, which you can read more about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527231735/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/17/art_vendors.php">here</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Do you feel both artists who sell their own art, and vendors who sell art that they didn&apos;t create should both have a right to sell on the sidewalks?</strong> Visual art is protected by freedom of speech. It&apos;s just like a book. The author of a book is protected and so is the publisher, bookstore or library that conveys that book to the public. In the same way an art gallery, museum, artist or art vendor are all equally protected. Its&apos; the art, not who sells it, that matters.</p>

<p><strong>What about those who are selling watches, etc?</strong> In our lawsuits the Federal Courts described &quot;art&quot; as paintings, photos, sculptures and prints. Since then the city expanded that definition to include DVDs, music CDs etc. A watch might be beautiful, but it is not considered to be protected speech. Non First Amendment protected materials can only be sold by licensed vendors. since winning our lawsuits, artists are exempt from any license or parks permit.</p>

<p><strong>How long have the NYPD and/or BID been hassling the SoHo street vendors?</strong> The city of NY started harassing artists when Giuliani became Mayor. He was responding to pressure from the BIDs (Business Improvement Districts) and the SoHo Alliance, a landlord group. The harassment ebbs and flows but it has never stopped since 1994. Right now the main harassment is legislative, Councilmember Gerson&apos;s more than 16 unenforceable, unnecessary and unconstitutional vending Intros.</p>
