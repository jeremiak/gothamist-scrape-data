<p>What of-the-moment, unoriginal costume will you be seeing all over the place this Halloween? The Miley Cyrus Twerking Costume, and specifically the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140623/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/miley_cyrus_vmas.php">Miley Cyrus Twerking At The VMAs</a> Costume. AKA &quot;Slutty Miley Cyrus.&quot;</p>

<p>There are both male and female versions of this thing available, and the styles range from sort-of-authentic to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140623/http://www.spirithalloween.com/product/el-teddy-bear-tshirt-adult-md/?w=miley&amp;UTM_campaign=Search:SC:miley">shitty t-shirt</a>&#x2014;but guys, if we&apos;re gonna do this, let&apos;s put a little effort into it? Pick the best Miley <em>for you</em>. Maybe you&apos;re the VMAs Miley, maybe you&apos;re the &quot;We Can&apos;t Stop&quot; Miley, maybe you&apos;re &quot;The Wrecking Ball&quot; Miley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140623/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8"><em>we&apos;re not here to judge</em></a>. Or maybe you just go with a generic Miley wherein you just wear grillz, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140623/http://www.amazon.com/Miley-Cyrus-Foam-Twerk-Finger/dp/B00F7PXI7A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380040571&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=miley+halloween">a Twerking finger</a>, and stick your tongue out a lot. Maybe you&apos;re still more Hannah Montana? Maybe you&apos;re just &quot;dancing with Molly&quot;?</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want to get a little more creative, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140623/http://www.halloweencostumes.com/blog/p-424-diy-miley-cyrus-costume--plus-robin-thicke-.aspx">HalloweenCostumes.com</a> has put together a tutorial of how to draw some of Miley&apos;s moments out and turn them into a costume. Might we recommend your Robin Thicke partner keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140623/http://www.amazon.com/Beetlejuice-Costume-Black-White-X-Large/dp/B003D7ZJUI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380043122&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=beetlejuice+costume">the Beetlejuice mask</a> on, though?</p>
