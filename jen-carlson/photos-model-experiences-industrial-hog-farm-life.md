</div></div>					<p>(Warning: These photographs are NSFW, for the most part.) Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926235850/http://www.mirukim.com/">Miru Kim</a> has unveiled a new photo series, and earlier this week explained to us, &quot;I toured industrial hog farms and it was quite intense.&quot; She even provided video of the experience which you can watch below... it is, to use Kim&apos;s word, <em>intense</em>, and much less tranquil than the photographs (though not quite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926235850/http://www.greatestmoviedeaths.com/2009/06/hannibal-verger-gets-fed-to-pigs.html">Hannibal</a>).</p>

<p>Kim&apos;s new installation, <em>The Pig That Therefore I Am</em>, opens on March 24th at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926235850/http://doosangallery.com/newyork/upcoming_eng.asp">DOOSAN Gallery</a> (533 West 25th Street), and will run through April 23rd.</p>
