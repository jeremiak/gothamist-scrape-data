Except sometimes they&apos;re entitled douchebags sitting in first class and acting like the laws don&apos;t pertain <em>to them</em>, only to the cattle in the back. Like young Josh Duhamel for example (we know, he seems so nice in the movies!). According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312223343/http://www.tmz.com/person/josh-duhamel/">TMZ</a>, Duhamel was on a flight from New York (LGA) to Kentucky yesterday and he flat out <em>refused</em> to turn his BlackBerry off&#x2014;a move that eventually got him kicked to the curb.</p>

<p>One passenger says the flight attendant asked the actor to turn it off before takeoff, but he laughed, refused, and was &quot;very rude&quot; and &quot;taunting the attendant.&quot; (We knew marrying Fergie was going to ruin him!) After asking him two more times and getting nowhere, the attendant called for backup and he was escorted off the plane by two officers.</p>

<p>Duhamel&apos;s rep says &quot;he&apos;s sorry&quot;... and at least he didn&apos;t pull <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312223343/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/27/sheen_was_found_naked_frothing_in_e.php">a Sheen</a> while in town.</p>
