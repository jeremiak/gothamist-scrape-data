<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smfishtery.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524011953im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smfishtery.jpg" width="325" height="273" class="image-right"> </span>We&apos;ve gone all summer (<em>so far</em>) without a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524011953/http://gothamist.com/tags/montaukmonster">Montauk Monster</a> in sight, but this fish that washed up near the Brooklyn Bridge sated some New Yorker&apos;s cravings for a good sea creature mystery. A <em>fishtery</em>, if you will. And even if the mystery didn&apos;t last long enough to spawn any good government-based conspiracy theories, it&apos;ll have to do.</p>

<p>This morning an excited tipster, Greg Boyd, told us that last night around 7 p.m. &quot;I was walking with my friend Catherine after dinner by the East River.  There is a small sandy part of the river beach right under the Brooklyn Bridge&quot; on the Manhattan side... &quot;We saw about 30 or 40 people standing by the railing, and 2 people had jumped over the railing.  We walked up and saw this very large fish. It must be 5 feet long and has some very strange markings. I would really appreciate it if your readers can help identify this.&quot; He estimates that <em>hundreds</em> of New Yorkers probably saw this dead fish last night. </p>

<p><strong>We did contact the Ichthyology Department at the AMNH to confirm, but this looks to be a classic sturgeon</strong>, which is also the popular theory on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524011953/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1l82yi/look_what_washed_up_underneath_the_brooklyn_bridge/">Reddit</a> right now. Case closed. Mystery solved. Stop being so confused about nature things everyone. </p>

<p>Maybe we should all take a field trip to this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524011953/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/events/calendar/seining-river-wild-september-28">Seining The River</a> class next month, where scientists use a 20-foot seining net to humanely catch and release the critters found in the East River.</p>
