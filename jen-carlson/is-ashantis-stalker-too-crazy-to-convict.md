At least, according to an alternate juror on the case, who told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613020606/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ashanti_fan_nut_juror_BY19TMU4Pkr1mGkMQbGcCK">the NY Post</a>, &quot;He clearly seemed delusional. I have no idea what that jury is going to do, but I hope they don&apos;t convict.&quot; To convict 31-year-old, they&apos;ll need to prove he had intent to harrass... but it&apos;s possible he&apos;s &quot;too kooky to convict,&quot; as the paper says.</p>
