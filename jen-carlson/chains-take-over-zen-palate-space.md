Sigh. And what&apos;s going up in its place? The much rumored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724190217/http://gothamist.com/tags/tgifriday">T.G.I. Friday&apos;s</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724190217/http://gothamist.com/tags/timhortons">Tim Horton&apos;s</a> of course, helping to complete the circle of chains around the park.
