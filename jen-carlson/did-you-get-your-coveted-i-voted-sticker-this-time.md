                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="ivotedsticker0913.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ivotedsticker0913.jpg" width="325" height="324"> <br> <i style=" width:325px; ;display:block"> via NYC Votes</i></div> During last year&apos;s big election, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/wheres_your_i_voted_sticker.php">many wondered</a> where their &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker was. While they haven&apos;t ever been as common in New York City as they have been in the suburbs, <em>they have existed here</em>. And the simple things have been a way to throw your involvement in the political process in your non-voting neighbor&apos;s face... and maybe score a free coffee that day. But the stickers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/http://www.policymic.com/articles/21527/i-voted-stickers-cost-the-government-millions">cost the government millions</a>, and they&apos;ve become harder to come by over the years. They&apos;re out there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/10/its_primary_day_in_nycgo_vote_and_t.php">today</a>, however.<p></p>

<p>The New York City Campaign Finance Board held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/http://www.ny1.com/content/politics/political_news/186487/finalists-announced-in--i-voted--sticker-design-contest">a contest</a> earlier this year to redesign the &quot;I Voted&quot; stickers, and they are handing them out today. <em>Supposedly.</em> At press time no Gothamist staffers have seen them at their polling places.</p>

<p>Sadly, even if you do get a sticker, they&apos;re not the beloved and iconic design or shape&#x2014;way too square and cluttered! But you can always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/04/i_voted_and_didnt_even_get_a_sticke.php">print out your own</a> classic one&#x2014;maybe for November.</p>

<p>And remember: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/its_illegal_to_instagram_your_vote.php">it&apos;s NOT illegal</a> to take photos at your polling place&#x2014;NYC Votes has even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=569629946430658&amp;set=a.159475924112731.34683.151485624911761&amp;type=1&amp;comment_id=1726953&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=2">made a call</a> for &quot;voting selfies&quot; (hashtag them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012541/https://twitter.com/search?q=ivotenyc&amp;src=typd">#IVoteNYC</a>).</p>
