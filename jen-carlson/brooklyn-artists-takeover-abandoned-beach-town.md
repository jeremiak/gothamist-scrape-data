</div></div>					<p>Throw a few Brooklyn artists into an abandoned beach town <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011200856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_Beach">in Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>, and this is the result. A troupe of creatives got together this September, prior to the current demolition of the long-abandoned community, to send it off in style. Under the direction of Ben Wolf and Caledonia Curry (you know her as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011200856/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/swoon_artist_1.php">Swoon</a>), the peninsula had residents once again. Wolf is now working his magic on some abandoned places <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011200856/http://www.juxtapoz.com/Juxtapoz+Live+in+Detroit/28659-salvaging-sections-of-abandoned-spaces-for-sculpture-with-ben-wolf">in Detroit</a>&#x2014;maybe next he can take over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011200856/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/18/a_look_at_abandoned_far_rockaway.php">Far Rockaway</a>. </p>

<p>What was the atmosphere like in the temporary artists village in Connecticut? Below is a video of a performance ritual that the Apothecary Ladies, with Volatile Blossom, performed while there.</p>
