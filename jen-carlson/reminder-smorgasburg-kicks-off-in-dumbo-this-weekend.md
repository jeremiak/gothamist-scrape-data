<p>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000546/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/29/smorgasburg_coming_to_dumbo_sundays.php">noted last week</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000546/http://gothamist.com/tags/smorgasburg">Smorgasburg</a> is opening up in the Tobacco Warehouse in DUMBO this Sunday, and will be there every Sunday through November 18th. With the Tobacco Warehouse essentially being an enclosed (yet open air) space in an area saturated with tourists, this whole thing could turn into a cage match over the last artisanal salted caramel ice cream cone... or maybe it&apos;ll be perfectly civilized. Who knows, <em>could go either way.</em> </p>

<p>The DUMBO space does have at least one advantage over the Williamsburg one: it&apos;s right on top of Brooklyn Bridge Park, offering unlimited grassy seating and sweeping views. We have a few tips to make your Smorgasburging more enjoyable:</p><ul><li>Get there towards the end of the day (it&apos;ll likely be just as busy at 11 a.m. when it opens, as it will be at 6 p.m. when it closes). Coming later you can have an evening picnic as the sun goes down: bring a bottle of wine with you to enjoy in the park with your meal&#x2014;just be sure to print out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000546/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/09/behold_the_brand_loophole_that_stym.php">our handy guide explaining how to avoid getting ticketed while drinking in public</a>!<br>
</li><li>If you&apos;re coming from somewhere off the East River that&apos;s not within walking distance, take the East River Ferry! The $4 pricetag is worth it&#x2014;once you&apos;re on, just head up to the back deck and enjoy some quality boat time.<br>
</li><li>Wait thirty minutes after eating before sitting down in the vicinity of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000546/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/10/thong_guy_speaks.php">Thong Guy</a>.</li></ul>Since our initial announcement that the feast fest would be making its way to DUMBO, some of the vendors have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000546/http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/smorgasburg-spreads-to-dumbo/?ref=dining">been announced</a>. Among others you&apos;ll get: Soy Hound (peanut butter and spicy ginger root-flavored soy milk), the Milk Truck (grilled cheese), Mile End (smoked meat sandwich on rye), SlantShack Jerky, the wildly popular Mighty Quinn&#x2019;s barbecue, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000546/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/neill_and_renae_holland_bon_chovie.php">Gothamist favorite Bon Chovie</a>, which serves addictive fried anchovies prepared two ways: decapitated or Jersey-style&#x2014;with the heads still attached. <p></p>

<p>According to a press release we received, each Sunday (except for the 30th when they&apos;ll be closed) you&apos;ll get &quot;a mix of prepared and packaged artisanal foods sold by more than 75 local vendors.&quot;</p>
