<p>The best thing about the banana car driving around New York City right now is that it doesn&apos;t seem to be some sort of marketing gimmick set forth by the Banana Council of America, or whatever. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235748/http://www.bigbananacar.com/">These brothers</a> just wanted to make a car that looked like a banana, so they did! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235748/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/06/did_you_see_a_b.php">Runnin&apos; Scared</a>, Steve Braithwaite and his brother Spade created it after the former &quot;glanced at a bowl of bananas at a gas station and thought, &apos;I could build a banana car!&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>They&apos;ve been driving around the city today, hitting up Rockefeller Center and Times Square, but will be heading back to Pennsylvania soon. Follow them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235748/https://twitter.com/#!/bigbananacar">on Twitter</a>, because at press time they only have four followers, and check out more of the banana&apos;s Big Apple adventures <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235748/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Banana-Car/362619161489#!/media/set/?set=a.10150295306296490.378516.362619161489">right here</a>.</p>
