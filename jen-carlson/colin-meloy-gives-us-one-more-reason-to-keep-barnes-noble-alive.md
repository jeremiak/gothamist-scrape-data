And this fall they&apos;re bringing some amazing names to their &quot;Upstairs in the Square&quot; makeshift lit parlour. Some highlights are below&#x2014;these are all held at the Union Square Barnes &amp; Noble at 33 East 17th Street, are free of charge, and are things you can&apos;t do on your Kindle!</p>

<ul><li>Thursday, September 22nd, 7 p.m.: Christopher Bollen, author of <em>Lightning People</em>, and singer-songwriter Eleanor Friedberger (The Fiery Furnaces).
</li><li>Monday, September 26th, 6 p.m.: Colin Meloy of the Decemberists and Carson Ellis, author and illustrator of the novel, <em>Wildwood</em> (it&apos;s suggested that this will only be a conversation)
</li><li>Thursday, October 13th, 7 p.m.: Ann Beattie, author of <em>The New Yorker Stories</em>, and singer-songwriter Mark&#xE9;ta Irglov&#xE1; (Anar)</li></ul>

<p>Check out video from past events <a href-="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/upstairs-at-the-square/index.asp">here</a>. Get there extra early for the Meloy and Ellis event to grab a seat... and bring the kids! Though in a recent interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144809/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/colin-meloy-and-carson-ellis-on-their-latest-collaboration-wildwood/244890/">The Atlantic</a>, Meloy says, &quot;mostly I wrote for the nine- and 10-year-olds, but I&apos;m pretty certain there are a lot of adults reading it, too.&quot;</p>
