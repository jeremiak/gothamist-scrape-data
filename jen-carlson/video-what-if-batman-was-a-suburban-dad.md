<p>What if Gotham&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161246/http://gothamist.com/tags/darkknight">Dark Knight</a> was a... daddy? Living in the suburbs? With a bunch of kids and a Vine account? These questions all have answers, and they are all in this video compilation of BatDad&apos;s Vines. After a few clips you may think you &quot;get it,&quot; but keep watching, BatDad knows no diminishing returns, and the content just keeps getting better throughout the three minutes. There are also plenty of lessons: use a spoon to eat cereal, brush your gums to avoid gingivitis, and use a wetnap after eating ribs.</p>
