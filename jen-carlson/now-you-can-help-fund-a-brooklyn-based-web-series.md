<p>A couple of years ago, before we even knew the name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045433/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls">Hannah Horvath</a>, a different show about the young and confused of North Brooklyn aired online. Stop cringing... sometimes these shows, done well, are enjoyable and at times even represent a little piece of us all. Sometimes they are just funny. Either way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045433/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/i_hate_being_single.php">Rob Michael Hugel&apos;s <em>I Hate Being Single</em></a> gave us the opposite of the hipster caricature portrayed on many TV shows, and it was REFRESHING. So of course we want to see more, and he&apos;s currently got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045433/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-hate-being-single-season-2">an Indiegogo campaign</a> to fund a 2nd season, which ends <em>very soon</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045433/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3277715/">Hugel</a> has been involved in a number of Funny Things, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045433/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/ilana_glazer_and_abbi_jacobson_crea.php"><em>Broad City</em></a>, which has made a successful leap from web series to television series. You guys are watching that, right? So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307045433/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-hate-being-single-season-2">toss some change in his jar</a> and maybe you can say you helped the Next Big Thing.</p>

<p>Hugel tells us &quot;the show will take place in Williamsburg and feature the hilarious NYC comedians you know and love from Youtube, UCB, NBC, Comedy Central, all the cool places to get comedy. Season 2 is about seeing more from the characters out in the world. He&apos;s out there dating, meeting new people, failing miserably. Does Rob get bed bugs? Does he date a celebrity? Does he get fake engaged? Does he move to the suburbs? All these questions will be answered clearly if we meet our goal!&quot;</p>
