<p>Have you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041319/http://brosicingbros.com/">been iced</a>? It&apos;s that thing that has been going around wherein you are handed a Smirnoff Ice by a &quot;friend&quot; and &quot;forced&quot; to take a knee and chug it all right there, down to the very last sickeningly sweet drop. It is the kind of thing malt beverages were invented for, even if we didn&apos;t know it until now. Or rather, know it until about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041319/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/05/bros_icing_bros.php">a month ago</a>. Since it became a <em>thing</em> there have been no signs of this vicious trend going away, and in fact, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041319/http://www.theawl.com/2010/06/bros-icing-bros-and-the-fate-of-humanity-a-look-back">only gained momentum</a>. Why, even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041319/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/business/media/09adco.html?ref=media">Paper of Record</a> has now been forced to pay attention. So maybe that means it&apos;s <em>over</em>? </p>

<p>The Times notes that Smirnoff has denied this has been a devilishly genius marketing plan, but no matter what it&apos;s origins, no one is safe! Even beloved Brooklyn band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041319/http://yougoticed.tumblr.com/post/622691531/the-national-got-iced">The National has been iced</a>, not to mention Gothamist staffers Ben Yakas (pictured) and John Del Signore. So we ask you, Internet, what&apos;s next? Because we&apos;re scared, and tired of carrying around this Smirnoff bottle as an ice block.</p>
