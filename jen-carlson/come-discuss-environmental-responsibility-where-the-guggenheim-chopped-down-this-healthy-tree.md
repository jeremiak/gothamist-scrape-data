<span class="photo_caption">Tree &gt; no tree. (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152653/http://evgrieve.com/2011/05/guggenheim-makes-good-on-promise-of.html">EV Grieve</a>)</span></p>

<p>So the Guggenheim is full steam ahead on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152653/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/06/guggenheim_lab.php">their abandoned lot project</a> on First Street, which will house a temporary &quot;lab&quot; in which the community can discuss important things&#x2014;for example, the theme is going to partially focus on &quot;the urgent need for environmental and social responsibility.&quot; After its run in New York City (August 3rd to October 16th), the 2,500-square-foot structure is going to be flown to Asia and Germany (hitting nine cities total)&#x2014;something tells us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152653/http://www.grist.org/article/on-the-road-again1">Thom Yorke would disapprove</a>. Because when a project is focused around the environment and sustainability, shouldn&apos;t one be thinking about carbon footprints?  </p>

<p>And now the museum has <strike>blood</strike>sap on their hands&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152653/http://evgrieve.com/2011/05/guggenheim-makes-good-on-promise-of.html">EV Grieve</a>, they&apos;ve gone and chopped down a perfectly healthy tree in the lot, to make way for the temporary structure. We&apos;ve contacted the Guggenheim for comment, and will update when we hear back.</p>
