Since the film was released in 1961, Mickey Rooney&apos;s role as Mr. Yunioshi has drawn attention. In the 1993 film <em>Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story</em>, Lee gets upset at Rooney&apos;s stereotypical depiction of an Asian man, which has been called everything from &quot;broadly exotic,&quot; to &quot;comedic,&quot; to &quot;overtly racist&quot; and a &quot;cringe-inducing stereotype&quot; by critics over the years.<p></p>

<p>Now a Bronx woman, Ursula Liang, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074022/http://www.change.org/petitions/boycott-the-syfy-brooklyn-bridge-park-conservancy-screening-of-the-racist-breakfast-at-tiffanys">has started a petition</a> against Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s &quot;Movies With A View&quot; series, writing: &quot;By screening this film, the organizers are sanctioning the racism it contains, and subjecting new audiences (including children and Asian-Americans) to a minstrel show of racist ideology. <strong>It&#x2019;s 2011. It&#x2019;s New York. Do we still have to fight the hostile, hurtful world of 1961 Hollywood?</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Brooklyn Bridge Park Corp&apos;s Regina Myer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074022/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/asian_american_group_takes_aim_showing_HtIJurve47WSLekTWLnXSN#ixzz1S04pf0bO">told the NY Post</a> they &quot;recognize that one character in the <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</em> movie is an offensive stereotype, but this does not negate the value of the film as an American classic.&quot;</p>

<p>When the movie was protested and eventually pulled from a screening in California in 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074022/http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/35779">Rooney explained</a>, &quot;They hired me to do this overboard, and we had fun doing it. Never in all the more than 40 years after we made it&#x2014;not one complaint. Every place I&#x2019;ve gone in the world people say, &#x2018;God, you were so funny.&#x2019; Asians and Chinese come up to me and say, &#x2018;Mickey you were out of this world.&#x2019;&quot; What do you think?</p>
