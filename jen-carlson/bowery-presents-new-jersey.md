It seems that for every non-Bowery venue door <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211605/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/30/venues_1.php">that closes</a>, a new Bowery one opens. So where is a burgeoning company to go once they&apos;ve planted Mercury Lounges and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211605/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/05/the_music_stall.php">Music Halls</a> around NYC? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211605/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2008/03/the_bowery_pres.html">New Jersey</a>, of course.</p><blockquote>The historic 2,000-capacity Wellmont Theater in Montclair, N.J., will re-open its doors this fall under a recently formed partnership between the principals of New York-based independent concert promoter the Bowery Presents and longtime promoter Andy Feltz.<p></p>

<p>The new promotion company, Montclair Entertainment, was formed in September 2007 by the principals of the Bowery Presents and Feltz, who previously oversaw operations at New York&apos;s Beacon Theater and booked concerts into the city&apos;s United Palace Theater.</p></blockquote>The Wellmont Theater (which originally opened in 1922) will need to undergo a multi-million dollar renovation before the next Bruce Springsteen takes the stage. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211605/http://cinematreasures.org/theater/6642/">In 1951</a> it was listed with a seating capacity of 2,137 -- but that&apos;s likely to change slightly post-renovations. Will you cross the Hudson for your favorite band? The venue is poised to open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211605/http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/essex/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1205646086105450.xml&amp;coll=1">this fall</a>.<p></p>
