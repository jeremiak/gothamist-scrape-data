<p>On Tuesday morning, 22-year-old Taylor Galary (an SVA student!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183839/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/times_square_sheep_vandalized_via_r.php">roundhouse kicked</a> and decapitated one of the sheep in Times Square that are part of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183839/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/sheep_have_arrived_in_times_square.php">public art project</a>. She was arrested and charged with felony criminal mischief... something she seems to be quite proud of! </p>

<p>Galary (pictured) wrote on her Facebook page: &quot;HIDE YO SHEEP HIDE YO LAMB.&quot; One of her possible accomplices commented on her attempt to flee the scene after committing the crime, saying, &quot;Who&apos;d have thought it was easier to make an escape on the subway than a cab... plus i lost a shoe!!&quot;</p>

<p>Artist Kyu Seok Oh has already repaired the sheep, and told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183839/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110303/midtown/facebook-page-boasts-of-times-square-sheepkicking">DNA Info</a> that &quot;this is not a museum&#x2014;this is Times Square,&quot; though he noted: &quot;I prefer people enjoying the sheep&#x2014;hugging, touching.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the Times Square Alliance for their thoughts on the vandalism, and President Tim Tompkins told us, <strong>&#x201C;We have taken appropriate actions and have hired Little Bo Peep to provide security.&#x201D;</strong></p>
