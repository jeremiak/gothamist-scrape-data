<p>Red Hook was one of the harder-hit neighborhoods in NYC during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130301052143/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, and in the wake of the historic superstorm, the heavily-damaged Fairway supermarket announced that it would remain closed until &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130301052143/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/09/red_hook_fairway_wont_reopen_until.php">sometime in 2013</a>.&quot; But that &quot;sometime&quot; has finally arrived: the popular supermarket will reopen on Friday. In a press release we received last night, it was announced that a &quot;ceremony celebrating the rebirth and return to life of the entire community&quot; will take place on March 1st, which marks the grand reopening of the supermarket. Those in attendance will include Marty Markowitz, Mayor Bloomberg, and Miss America herself.</p>

<p>Markowitz says, &quot;Fairway Market is more than just a store; it is the quintessential grocery experience with something for everyone&#x2014;from our foodies and artisan advocates to even Brooklyn&apos;s own Miss America, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130301052143/http://gothamist.com/tags/malloryhagan">Mallory Hagan</a>.&quot; Markowitz added that his own weekend trips to Fairway have been missed over its four month absence&#x2014;&quot;I can personally attest that no week was quite the same without my wife and I taking our ritual trip to Fairway; of course Jamie would head straight to the fruit and vegetables aisle and I dash straight for the prepared foods counter and the great variety of smoked salmon.&quot;</p>

<p>The store, which first opened in 2006 in a Civil War-era building, was completely gutted following the storm, and all 39,000-square-feet have been renovated.</p>
