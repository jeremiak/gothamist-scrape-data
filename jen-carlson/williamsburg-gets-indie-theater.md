										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="INDIESCREEN0510.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232549im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/INDIESCREEN0510.jpg" width="350" height="309" class="image-left"> </span>Two years ago there was talk of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232549/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/24/williamsburg_looking_forward_to_mov.php">indie film arthouse</a> of sorts moving in to Williamsburg, but alas, that project didn&apos;t seem to get the greenlight. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232549/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/23/24_newwbmoviehouse_2010_06_04_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> is reporting that there&apos;s a movie theater moving in... for real this time!</p>

<p>Film fans will get a sneak preview of indieScreen next week at the Brooklyn International Film Festival, but the theater won&apos;t officially open until the end of June. Located next to Glasslands Gallery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232549/http://www.indiescreen.us/?p=490">on Kent Avenue near South 2nd</a> Street, the theater will be small, with 12 rows and 93 seats. And don&apos;t expect to see the next 3-D IMAX extravaganza there&#x2014;the screen will be a modest 17-feet by 8-feet.</p>

<p>Marco Ursino, who runs BIFF and owns the theater, says the last time they were able to screen a film in the neighborhood was at The Commodore theater, which was torn down in 2002. The drought is over Williamsburg!</p>

<p>While you won&apos;t be able to see the next big romantic comedy (sigh, right?), you <em>will</em> get something that&apos;s not offered at your local Loews: a bar, a 96-seat restaurant (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232549/http://www.indiescreen.us/?page_id=3">here&apos;s the menu</a>), and live music from time to time. And for parents, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232549/http://www.indiescreen.us/?page_id=17">looks like</a> they&apos;ll be screening kids movies every Sunday.</p>
