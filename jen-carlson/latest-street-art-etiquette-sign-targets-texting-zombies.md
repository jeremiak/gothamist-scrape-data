<p>A new sign has popped up from the Metropolitan Etiquette Authority (aka artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302175434/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayshells">Jayshells</a>), according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302175434/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2011/08/everyday-chatter_25.html">Vanishing NY</a>. Last time the artist tackled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302175434/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/22/subway_signs.php">subway etiquette</a> (you can now buy those signs over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302175434/http://www.etsy.com/shop/jayshells">at Etsy</a>), and this time around he&apos;s targeting texting zombies. Some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302175434/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/10/its_national_etiquette_week_be_nice.php?gallery0Pic=3#gallery">worst sidewalk etiquette criminals around</a>!</p>

<p>We contacted Jayshells for more information on his latest project, and to find out how soon he can get these signs up on every sidewalk&#x2014;he told us, &quot;there are four different messages&quot; and production should be done next week, after which point you&apos;ll hopefully be seeing them around.</p>
