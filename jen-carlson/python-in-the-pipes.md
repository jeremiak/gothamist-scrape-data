Nadege Brunacci, owner of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529165752/http://www.pitstopny.com/">Pit Stop</a> in Brooklyn, found a snake in her home&apos;s sewage pipes -- and not just any snake, a very large python! </p>

<p>Brunacci sent out an email explaining the incident (in her own special French way) to her friends, saying: &quot;monday night after 2...3.... beers i did need to go &apos;pipi&apos; did not put the light on .....i was in mi hom....got up and don&apos;t know whi look back in the toilette....this is what was in my toilette (pictured). i did &apos;pipi&quot; on a python.&quot; We asked Brunacci&apos;s ex (who tipped us off to the story) where the snake may have come from, but he told us &quot;No one knows where it came from. Its either an escaped or released pet and it could only have gotten into her bowl via the pipes (eek!).&quot; Eek indeed! He also told us &quot;the police weren&apos;t involved for the final removal and were dubious at the first report.&quot;</p>

<p>The slithery creature was saved from a suffocating fate when a plumber came in to cut open the bottom of the toilet -- where they found the 7&apos; python curled up in the pipes. Luckily Brunacci is an animal lover and took the snake &quot;to a friend who takes care of animals.&quot; We&apos;re told that &quot;its now doing fine and is named after Nadege. The woman who first pee&apos;d on it.&quot;</p>
