<p>Watch out subway sleepers, while you&apos;re catching some z&apos;s, you are also being watched, photographed and blogged about. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705061701/http://asleeponthesubway.tumblr.com/">Asleep on the Subway</a> has been gathering images of tired straphangers, and has started to get contributions as well, leaving no subway line safe to sleep on!</p>
