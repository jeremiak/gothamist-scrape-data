<p>Stabber Alley in DUMBO didn&apos;t really have much edge left&#x2014;what with becoming such a popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706060641/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/19/foursquare_mayorships_turn_ugly_in.php">Foursquare check-in spot</a>, and being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706060641/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/19/dumbo_manhattan_bridge_archway_less.php">safer than</a> the Manhattan Bridge archway. And now it&apos;s become a hot spot for graffiti artists, which means it&apos;s only matter of time before we see Shepard Fairey&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706060641/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/14/shepard_faireys_wife_sells_him_out.php">minions</a> wheatpasting what was once DUMBO&apos;s most feared alleyway. We spotted this new piece this morning, tagged right on to the iconic 101 year old bridge, and running the length of the passage. It reads: &quot;No tiene dinero pero tengo mi corazon.&quot; Translation: &quot;I have no money but I have heart,&quot; which doesn&apos;t really apply to many of DUMBO&apos;s residents.</p>
