Well, now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173450/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/47/dtg_cygnetrescue_2010_11_19_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that a swan was found with an illegal barbed fishhook through its foot on Friday.<p></p>

<p>Park-goers Anne-Katrin Titze and Ed Bahlman spotted the swan, which had a 10-foot-long fishing line trailing from it; they named him Achilles. The duo waited for him by the lake and grabbed him when he came out, at which time he &quot;squealed like a pig.&quot; Titze is a licensed wildlife rehabilitator, however, and managed to remove the hook.</p>

<p>Now Achilles is back to normal, but it&apos;s most likely only a matter of time before Man strikes again. Though at least the swans don&apos;t have to worry about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173450/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/canada_geese_1.php">the Feds</a>, for now.</p>
