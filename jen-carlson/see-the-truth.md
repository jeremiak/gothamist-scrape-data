However, the former Vice President has got a lot to say, and it&apos;s all kind of...scary. After writing his book, <em>Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit</em>, the man decided to lead us all in a save the world campaign.</p>

<p>He put together a slide show and traveled around the country, telling whoever would listen about how CO2 levels in our atmosphere are rising, how our oceans are getting hotter...and how 45 million of us will lose our lives if this doesn&apos;t stop. The only number decreasing is the amount of time we have to change our ways, only about 5 to 10 years! </p>

<p>Luckily some of those people who caught his presentation decided to make a documentary of it so that more people could get informed. Among those who made this in to a movie are Laurie David (Larry&apos;s wife) and Davis Guggenheim (the director of <em>Deadwood</em>). The movie, An Inconvenient Truth, is opening tonight in New York. So grab a friend and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232504/http://www.climatecrisis.net/">see the truth</a>. (There&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232504/http://www.climatecrisis.net/blog/">a blog</a>).  </p>
