										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mademen50311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170425im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mademen50311.jpg" width="365" height="274" class="image-right"> </span>One of the only things worth watching on television these days is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170425/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, which delivers a detailed portrayal of a mid-century New York City, along with office politics and domestic drama. Plus lots of sex, smoking and dry martinis. Rumors surrounding the show&apos;s return have been making their way to the press in recent weeks, with word that the 5th season has been stalled, and the show possibly <em>canceled</em>, due to some unresolved negotiations.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170425/http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2011/03/29/mad-men-held-hostage-drama-over-advertising-in-an-advertising-drama/">to TIME</a>, the hold up is part advertising (ironic!)&#x2014;allegedly the network wants to cut two minutes each episode for commercials, and work in more product integration. <em>And</em> to save some more cash, AMC wants to cut a couple of regular cast members (can the old Henny Youngman one-liner apply here? Perhaps Don Draper can tell the big wigs: &quot;Take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170425/http://gothamist.com/tags/bettydraper">my (ex)wife</a>&#x2014;please.&quot;). </p>

<p>At any rate, AMC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170425/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/amc-confirms-mad-men-delay-over-contract-dispute/">now confirms</a> that the earliest we&apos;ll be seeing a new episode is 2012. So rumors of the series being canceled were likely exaggerated&#x2014;it&apos;s not like AMC is going to put their most lucrative show into an early grave, nor is creator Matt Weiner going to walk away from a deal that would make him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170425/http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/matt-weiners-talks-for-mad-men-mega-deal-could-collapse-over-cost-shaving/">the highest-paid showrunner</a> on basic cable. Especially when everyone involved only has through season 6, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170425/http://crushable.com/other-stuff/mad-men-announces-sets-end-date/">the final season</a>, to cash in.</p>
