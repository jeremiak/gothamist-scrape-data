</div></div>					<p>This afternoon the Squibb Park Pedestrian Bridge finally opened, giving people one more way to travel from Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s Pier 1 to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, and vice versa (prior to this, there were only like, two ways to do this). The $5 million bridge was first announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175615/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/27/mother_of_all_pedestrian_bridges_to.php">last April</a>, with installation taking place from December through this past month. Upon learning it was open, we decided to give it a test walk. Some notes:</p><ul><li>The bridge is bouncy: This is pointed out in the sign at the bridge&apos;s entrances, but we still weren&apos;t quite prepared for the amount of bounce we felt. This will be fun until the bridge is filled up with tourist bus loads of people.<br>
</li><li>The bridge doesn&apos;t shave off any time: In fact, at a normal pace, it took one of us 0.2 seconds less time to travel to the same point <em>not </em>using the bridge.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_3_squibb.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175615im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2013_3_squibb.jpg" width="640" height="452" class="image-none"> </span><br>
</p><ul><li>The bridge offers non-stop amazing $5 million views: Even when you are traveling up it you can get a new viewpoint of Brooklyn Heights, with the skyline and Brooklyn Bridge just behind you.<br>
</li><li>This bridge will change your life: just watch this video...</li></ul><p></p>

</p><ul><li>The highest point is 50-feet.<br>
</li><li>The bridge is made of black locust wood (which can be found elsewhere in Brooklyn Bridge Park) and galvanized cable. <br>
</li><li>Bikes are allowed, but the you have to walk them.<br>
</li><li>Dogs are allowed!<br>
</li><li>The bridge is open from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m.</li></ul><p></p>
