<p><em>Cold enough for ya?</em> According to this map&#x2014;which was created using data from NOAA&apos;s Global Summary of the Day data archive&#x2014;we&apos;re in our least pleasant weather month of the year. While we have a zero percent chance of pleasantness this month, we&apos;re not <em>so</em> bad off&#x2014;according to this map, the least pleasant places to live are in Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, and Cedarville, California (which is near the borders of both Oregon and Nevada). And we&apos;re nowhere <em>near</em> those&#x2014;geographically or on this pleasant scale (we get 67 pleasant days a year, while they hover around 20).</p>

<p>But what <em>is</em> pleasant, anyway? Isn&apos;t it just a state of mind? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161901/http://www.kellegous.com/j/2014/02/03/pleasant-places/">this thing</a> it is defined by a mean temperature between 55&#xB0; F and 75&#xB0; F, a minimum temperature above 45&#xB0; F, and a temperature below 85&#xB0; F... and &quot;no significant precipitation or snow depth.&quot; All of the most pleasant places to live in the U.S. are in California, if you&apos;re into that definition of &quot;pleasant.&quot;</p>

<p>You know what they don&apos;t have out in Pleasantville though? The hardcore <em>character</em> that gets built through enduring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161901/http://gothamist.com/tags/polarvortex">Polar Vortexes</a>, the magic inspired by snowfall after snowfall after goddamn snowfall, the deep camaraderie we experience as we trudge through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161901/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/05/photos_nyers_show_strength_as_they.php#photo-1">slush puddles</a> alongside our fellow New Yorkers, the beauty of SEASONS. Is it really that pleasant to be able to go outside and let the sun kiss your skin <em>every boring, predictable day of the year</em>? That&apos;s just overkill, man. Anyway, February is almost halfway over.</p>
