<p>A lot of people hold <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211056/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> and his breakthrough album <em>Born To Run</em> close to their hearts. It is a tremendous album. An instant classic. A masterpiece. It can make a grown man weep. It can make a sociopath feel real human things. The first track, &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; is 4 minutes and 49 seconds of musical perfection and it&apos;s weird that more people haven&apos;t named their children after it. <em>Who amongst us wouldn&apos;t want to be named Thunder Road?</em> Listen to the Boss perform it in 1975, around the time the album was released.</p>

<p>Now every time you hear this song, arguably the best song in the giant catalog of American rock songs, you&apos;re going to think of Chris Christie. Chris Christie as a young boy kicking the dirt and wondering why coach won&apos;t just let him in at the bottom of the 9th when they&apos;re up by 5. Chris Christie at 16-years-old, cruising down the main drag of Whereverville, NJ, lookin&apos; for some tail. Chris Christie, now a young man in his 20s, taking a shot of Midori as he readies to walk down the aisle. Chris Christie, driving out of Newark with the windows rolled down, bellowing, &quot;It&apos;s a town full of losers and I&apos;m pulling out of here to win!&quot; Chris Christie, sweating and alone awaiting confirmation of his appointment under the direction of George Bush. Chris Christie rubbing his palms together and coming up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211056/http://thinkprogress.org/election/2015/08/07/3689230/chris-christie-september-10/">with new lies</a> behind his mahogany desk. Chris Christie looking in the mirror, pumping himself up for world domination. You get the idea, Chris Christie doesn&apos;t do anything without listening to The Boss, no matter what anyone, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211056/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/20/video_chris_christie_is_bff_with_br.php">not even THE BOSS</a>, says.</p>

<p>Today, on the 40th anniversary of its release, Chris Christie had to make that album about him. In a single, longform tweet, he ruined it all. Thanks, Chris Christie. </p>
