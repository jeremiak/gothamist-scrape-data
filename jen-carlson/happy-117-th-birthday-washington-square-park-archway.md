</div></div>					<p>Today in 1895, the Washington Square Park Archway was unveiled. To celebrate its 117th birthday, we dipped back into the Municipal Archives photo archives and found some new vintage gems showing the archway way back when, and plans for the park in 1890.</p>

<p>The structure itself was designed by architect Stanford White and built between 1890-1892, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152712/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/04/flashback_washington_square_park_ar.php#photo-1">not unveiled until 1895</a> when New York governor Levi P. Morton paraded down 5th Avenue to present it to a crowd of New Yorkers.</p>

<p>Click through for a look back, and we&apos;re crossing our fingers that this is the year we get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152712/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/inside_the_archway.php">inside of the arch</a>!</p>
