From November through April they&apos;re out there every Sunday, also raising money for New York Cares and Camp Sunshine. Polar Bear Club VP Tony Nastro said, &quot;There&apos;s an energy that comes from the people that do this, that just makes you feel you&apos;re in the right place, you&apos;re doing the right thing.&quot; They&apos;ll be out there again soon for their annual New Year&apos;s Day plunge.</p>
