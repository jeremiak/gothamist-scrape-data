										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="teenbeatnkotb1111.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103735im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/teenbeatnkotb1111.jpeg" width="350" height="280" class="image-right"> </span>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103735/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/11/very_important_nkotb_will_be_in_nyc.php">we mentioned last week</a>, the New Kids On The Block (or if you prefer, NKOTB) were hinting at a New York City concert on New Year&apos;s Eve. Our (<em>friend&apos;s</em>) spirit <strike>child</strike> teen awoke, heart aflutter, at the possibility... and now it&apos;s OFFICIAL. The band has just annouced that they&apos;ll be playing at Roseland Ballroom on December 31st, and they&apos;re ditching those hacks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103735/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8IIu6wSRwc">The Backstreet Boys</a> for this one, bringing on Boyz II Men instead. The press release we received reads as follows:</p><blockquote>New Kids On The Block have decided to spend the biggest night of the year with their fans in Times Square hosting a super sized show at Roseland Ballroom.  The best selling R and B group of all time, Boyz II Men will perform and additional surprise guests are rumored to be in the works.  NKOTB will lead the countdown to ring in the New Year.</blockquote>Tickets go on sale this Friday, November 18th, at 10 a.m. Fun fact: The last time we tried to get tickets to a New Kids On The Block concert there was <em>no internet</em>, and we had to call Ticketmaster from a landline for a shot at seats.<p></p>

<p>Donnie Wahlberg, hands down the hottest and baddest of boys in the group, according to our embarrassing <em>friend</em>, declares: &quot;I can guarantee this will be a New Year&#x2019;s Eve to remember!&#x201D; Until that magical night, let&apos;s revisit the band&apos;s performance at the Apollo from about a million year&apos;s ago.</p>
