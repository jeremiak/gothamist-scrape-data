<p>Brooklyn artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305111856/http://tonkydesigns.com/blog/2009/04/18/gowanus-canal-super-fun-superfund/">Anthony Clune</a> says from his Gowanus studio he &quot;can smell the overflow sewage that cascades into the canal after heavy rains, inhale the concrete dust billowing from mixing facilities, and meditate on the prismatic oil-slick rainbow floating out to sea.&quot; So he gave what he calls his Gowanus Canal Tonky Octopus some text in hopes of hurrying the cleanup process, which is currently being debated about as city and state debate the pros and cons of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305111856/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/08/gowanus_1.php">Superfund status</a>. Clune says, &quot;The Gowanus Canal area is an unhealthy place for New Yorkers to live and work and I hope it gets cleaned up soon. It seems that adding the area to EPA&#x2019;s Superfund list is the most expeditious way to do so.&quot; However, the Bloomberg administration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305111856/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/15/gowanus_superfund.php">has said</a> it would take two decades for the EPA to finish their cleanup, and would stall the city&apos;s cleanup (and development).</p>
