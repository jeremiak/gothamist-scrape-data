Their lyrics have been written by some familiar names: Jonathan Lethem, Margaret Atwood, Paul Auster and Dave Eggers are amongst them. This year they enter their 10th year of making music, and this Friday they&apos;ll be at Joe&apos;s Pub celebrating on stage. Join in on the party, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509234907/http://www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,2894">buy tickets here</a>.</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Did we mention they wrote us a theme song?</em></p>

<p><strong>Your 10th anniversary is coming up this week, how did it all begin?</strong> As absurd as it sounds, Joshua and I were accordion and harmonica technicians at the Hohner North American distribution and repair center in Richmond, VA.  Joshua tuned, tested, and repaired accordions eight hours a day, five days a week, and I did the same with harmonicas.  Although we vaguely knew each other from music school (Virginia Commonwealth University, where we both studied music composition), it wasn&apos;t until Hohner that we really got to know each other.  Of course, this meant shooting rubber bands at each other across the warehouse, and making stupid noises over the intercom.&#x2013;Michael Hearst<br>
 <br>
This band really started as a side project where Michael and I would write, arrange, and record a song all in one day&#x2014;usually our day off from work.   We used many of the instruments at the Hohner factory like accordion, harmonica, and electravox.  The star of our studio sound, of course, was and still is the claviola.  It arrived one day at the Hohner  warehouse and we both new right away the awesome and ridiculous potential of this instrument.  One Ring Zero was born on that day.... &#x2013;Joshua Camp</p>

<p><strong>What is your songwriting process?</strong> Our songwriting process is all over the map.  Sometimes we start in the studio with a blank slate and the two of us hash it out from beginning to end.  Other times Michael or myself will bring in a fully-realized demo and it will need only slight tweaking by the other.  And still other times one of us will bring in a song fragment which will be completed by the other.  We&apos;re both very flexible and open to the creative process.  If something works, it works.  I think this approach is the main reason why we&apos;re still working together.  -JC</p>
