<p>Yesterday a woman roundhouse kicked one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005723/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/sheep_have_arrived_in_times_square.php">the 24 paper sheep</a> currently set up in Times Square as part of a week-long installation. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005723/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/times_square_lamb_butcher_T9T2UiZYx0fOSDEm1S4MGK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, the woman&#x2014;Taylor Galary&#x2014;decapitated the sheep with her foot at around 7 a.m., then tried to flee in a cab. The 22-year-old was charged with criminal mischief. But to be fair, she was <em>dared</em> to do it. At press time it&apos;s unclear whether this was an escalated double-dog dare, or just a standard dare.</p>

<p>The remaining 23 sheep will be in Times Square until March 7th, as long as there are no copycat incidents.</p>
