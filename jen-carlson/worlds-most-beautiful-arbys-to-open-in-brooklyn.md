The Landmarks Preservation Commission did say there would be a meeting addressing the proposed alterations to the historic interior, but insisted the gas lamps and wall-length mirrors would remain. However, the franchisee Raymond Chera told the News: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re keeping everything in place, and anything we move in will be nonpermanent and easy to move out. It will probably be the most beautiful Arby&#x2019;s ever.&#x201D; But will it be prettier than the T.G.I.Friday&apos;s that was there before it? Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150213180126/http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2009/03/tale-of-2-arbys.html">over in Queens</a> things at Arby&apos;s are looking quite a bit different.</p>
