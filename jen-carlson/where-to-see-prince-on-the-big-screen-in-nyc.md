<p>The 1984 rock drama that brought Prince into the spotlight is coming back to the big screen this weekend. AMC has announced that they&apos;ve teamed up with Warner Bros. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905201025/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/purple-rain-returning-to-amc-theaters-this-weekend-1201759183/">to bring screenings</a> of the movie to 87 locations nationwide. The screenings will take place on Saturday, April 22nd and run through Thursday, April 27th. Here are the NYC theaters that will be showing the flick:</p>

<p><em>AMC 19th St East 6<br>
AMC Empire 25<br>
AMC Jersey Gardens 20<br>
AMC Kips Bay 15<br>
AMC New Brunswick 18<br>
AMC Palisades 21 And Imax<br>
AMC Stony Brook 17</em></p>

<p>In a career that spanned 40 years, Prince seamlessly moved between the movie and music worlds, and while <em>Purple Rain</em> may be his most renowned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905201025/http://laist.com/2016/04/21/prince_in_hollywood.php">film effort</a>, it&apos;s not the only one returning to theaters. <em>Under the Cherry Moon</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905201025/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092133/">1986</a>) will be coming to the IFC Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905201025/http://www.ifccenter.com/films/under-the-cherry-moon/">in May</a>, following their own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905201025/http://www.ifccenter.com/series/when-u-were-ours-remembering-prince/">April screenings</a> of <em>Purple Rain</em>. Here are trailers for both: </p>
