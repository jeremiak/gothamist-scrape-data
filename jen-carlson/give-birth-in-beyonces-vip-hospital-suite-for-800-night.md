<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131151236/http://gothamist.com/tags/blueivy">Baby Blue Ivy Carter</a> turns six days old, and boy what a journey it&apos;s been so far! Now that all of the boring paperwork is out of the way&#x2014;what with Lenox Hill Hospital &quot;investigated&quot; following complaints from non-famouses that Jay-Z and Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s special treatment prevented them from seeing their non-famous babies&#x2014;we can delve into the fun stuff. Like the birthing room!</p>

<p>While the hospital was accused of accepting $1.3 million from the couple, allegedly for an entire floor to themselves which included a newly renovated suite with bulletproof doors, the hospital has denied it all. You see, it just so happened that the hospital finished creating their new VIP suites just in time for Baby Blue&apos;s arrival, with Beyonc&#xE9; being the first mom to stay there. Things just really lined up! </p>

<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131151236/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hey_nice_crib_41vLD98Wlk3g2lNTbxisWP#ixzz1jLnW4Ye5">the NY Post</a> has learned more about the suite, like how it&apos;s &quot;decorated in calming ivory, gray and blue... features a separate, full living-room area with upholstered couches and club chairs, satin throw pillows, a coffee table and brushed platinum lamps and accents. There&#x2019;s even a kitchenette stocked with dishes and tricked out with stainless-steel appliances and a gleaming subway-tile backsplash.&quot; There are seven rooms total in the VIP area, each going for about $700 to $800 per night, and the Carter family took up four of those suites, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131151236/http://www.tmz.com/2012/01/13/beyonce-hospital-suite/">according to TMZ</a>.</p>
