<p>There&apos;s about a two month window before we&apos;ll probably all, as Americans, be banned from Italy: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124640/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> season four will premiere <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124640/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/03/jersey-shore-season-four-italy-premiere-date/">on August 4th</a>, and then <em>everyone</em> will see the horrors that Italy was subjected to. The season will include the troupe&apos;s tour of the country, where they&apos;re still filming; the cast will be kicked out soon enough though, as they&apos;re already starting production back in New Jersey for season five, starting this month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, earlier this week the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124640/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304563104576353810943734854.html">Wall Street Journal</a> dove into the Italy drama, essentially serving up a Tale of Two Italians story. They wrote: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The clash of cultures is rooted in opposing views of what it means to be Italian. Florence&#x2014;the land of Michelangelo, Dante and Gucci&#x2014;has always regarded itself as an emblem of Italian elegance and courtly etiquette. The Jersey Shore brand of being Italian involves more braggadocio. Revealing clothing, occasional impromptu urination, public displays of drunkenness and casual romance are the hallmarks of the &quot;Guido&quot; and &quot;Guidette,&quot; as cast members proudly call themselves on the show&#x2014;even though others consider the terms derogatory.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The country&apos;s nightmare will be over on June 20th, when the cast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606124640/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/06/jersey-shore-leaving-italy-returning-new-jersey-finish-season-four">flies home</a> to only <em>slightly</em> more loving arms.</p>
