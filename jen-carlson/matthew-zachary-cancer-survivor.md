Tomorrow night they&apos;ll be holding their 2nd Annual Stupid Cancer Comedy Show with comedians from &quot;Last Comic Standing.&#x201D; Zachary recently told us about his foundation, his experience with the disease, and what he&apos;ll do if Sarah Palin gets in the White House. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122056/http://www.eventbrite.com/event/105404267">buy tickets for the event here</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about your own experience with cancer?</strong> Not that there&apos;s ever a good time for it, but I was diagnosed with malignant pediatric brain cancer at the age of 21 just six months shy of my college graduation. At the time, I was an aspiring concert pianist en route to grad school to study composition for TV and film at The University of Southern California. My primary symptom was the loss of motor coordination in my left hand, and doctors more or less told me that I&apos;d be lucky to walk let alone ever perform again. </p>

<p>I had an eight hour surgery to remove the tumor on January 10th, 1996, and four days later the pathology came back as malignant. The type of tumor I had was congenital and almost never seen in patients over the age of 6. I was one in a million and went through an multitude of opinions on what would be the best treatment for me. It ranged from &quot;bone marrow transplant with aggressive whole body radiation and a year of chemo&quot; to &quot;go home now.&quot; So what was I to do? Plus I was a 21 year old patient being treated by pediatric physicians who were not used to speaking with patients. They were used to speaking with the <em>parents</em> of patients. I was alone. No one understood me. I was in the fight of my life. And all I wanted to do was play the piano and graduate from college on time. I would wind up doing both but at great cost. </p>

<p>Nearing thirteen years later, I am disease free, still in remission but I do not feel cured as I currently face numerous physical, cognitive, neurodegenerative and physiological deficits in the wake of my survivorship principally due to the surgery and post-operative radiation therapy treatments. As Lance Armstrong says, &quot;Cancer may leave your body but it never leaves your life.&quot; You got that right. I do not regret any decisions I made and am happy to be alive today and to be able to give back to my own generation&apos;s needs for cancer support. </p>
