</p><p>Recently at our show in Austin, the mayor of that city discussed the importance of keeping live music (and the venues it is played in) alive by supporting it (over, say, sports). You can watch his speech <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUPdIopXXMQ">here</a>. With that in mind, it seems New York has been losing venues left and right as of late. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/03/mercury_lounge_1.html">The latest word</a> is that Mercury Lounge may be closing, though it&apos;s unconfirmed - and we&apos;re really hoping it is not true, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://papermag.com/blogs/2007/03/mercury_lounge_to_maybe_probab.php">the rumors</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.garysavelson.com/2007/03/26/the-mercury-lounge-closing-217-e-houston-st-new-york-city/">have been circulating</a>: 

</p><blockquote>&quot;Popular live music venue The Mercury Lounge at 217 E. Houston St, New York City is rumored to be closing sometime in the not too distant future. Real estate development will replace the small club that hosts international, national and local buzz talent.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Some venues close and reopen in lower rent areas (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/01/16/luna_lounge_ope.php">Luna Lounge</a>) and some shut their doors forever (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/10/16/doors_close_at.php">CBGB</a>). Most recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/12/roxys_last_call.php">the Roxy called it quits</a> and Sin-e and Tonic have announced their closings as well. Tonic was saved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2005/02/01/save_tonic.php">two years ago</a> (we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2005/03/18/melissa_carusoscott_coowner_tonic.php">interviewed</a> one of the owners at the time), and they have not yet announced why they&apos;re closing for good this time (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.timeoutny.com/newyork/tonyblog/?p=1874">they&apos;ll shut down in two weeks</a>). As far as smaller downtown venues go, we&apos;re left with some less than ideal spaces: the Annex, the Delancey and Fat Baby - none of which have ever been a favorite to see a show at. Seems if Pianos, Cake Shop and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/01/26/gothamists_week_2.php">recently made-over</a> Knitting Factory can manage to keep their doors open, they&apos;ll be the places to go (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://toddpnyc.com/">the Todd P shows</a> and their ever-changing venues are probably the best option in town). </p>

<p>Of course, when one venue closes - another opens. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/11/14/a_look_inside_t.php">The Box</a>, The Gramercy Theater, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/02/20/andrew_wk_motiv.php">100 Lafayette</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/01/12/gothamists_week_1.php">United Palace Theater</a> and now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.highlineballroom.com/">Highline Ballroom</a> are the newest in town. Others just change their names, Irving Plaza (for some inexplicable reason) is now going to be calling itself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/03/the_fillmore_ne.html">the Filmore New York at Irving Plaza</a>, and Northsix will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309062427/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/03/05/the_future_of_n.php">The Music Hall of Williamsburg</a>. </p>
