All but three <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072715/http://chicagoist.com/2013/10/14/if_you_know_this_chicago_man.php">lucky people</a> passed the pieces by, which were being sold for just $60 a pop (they are actually worth hundreds of thousands each). <p></p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072715/https://twitter.com/lizabethzindel">Lizabeth Zindel</a> tracked down the man who rented Banksy his stand&#x2014;Thuptin Kunkhen and his friend Tenzin told her Banksy rented Kunkhen&apos;s &quot;his table and everything,&quot; as well as someone else&apos;s, paying a total of $500 ($300 to one, $200 to the other). Since he only sold $420 worth of work, that means Banksy actually lost $80 that day!</p>

<p>When pressed, Tenzin said Banksy &quot;should give him [Kunkhen] one artwork,&quot; though seemed happy enough with what he did pay for the stand. The two had never heard of Banksy before&#x2014;&quot;first time I&apos;m hearing his name, and now I know everyone&apos;s asking&quot; about him.</p>

<p>Kunkhen was given a phone number, presumably to reach Banksy&apos;s team, but when he&apos;s attempted to call it after that day... no one has answered.</p>
