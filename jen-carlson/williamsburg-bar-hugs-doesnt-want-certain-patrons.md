<p>With a name like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406113909/http://www.yelp.com/biz/hugs-brooklyn">Hugs</a> one would think the Williamsburg-based bar would open their arms to all types of patrons. But they hung <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406113909/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ben5000/3930569910/">a sign</a> stating: &quot;No Timberlands, No Baggie Jeans, No Hoodies, No Sports Attire...&quot; and the list goes on... and we all know hipsters wear skinny jeans. Their finals words: &quot;<strong>We have the right to be selective!</strong>&quot; We&apos;ve contacted the bar to help us translate the sign, but they&apos;re currently using their right not to answer the phone.</p>
