<p>First things first: it&apos;s very important to state up front that this year&apos;s Governors Ball will NOT be on Governors Island. Which is a shame because there&apos;s just something a little more special about attending a show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235206/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/20/governors_ball_2011_fantastic_if_yo.php">on Governors Island</a> (yes, even with the ferry clusterf*ck), over say... Randall&apos;s Island. Which is where the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235206/http://GovBall.com/">Governors Ball</a> will be held this summer :( But let&apos;s focus on the positive. The fest is back for a 2nd year, and the organizers have just announced this summer&apos;s lineup, which is actually pretty great&#x2014;and hey, maybe these guys could end up saving the festival scene in New York&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235206/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/festival_fail.php">which has been dying</a> for quite some time. </p>

<p>The fest returns on June 23rd and 24th, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235206/http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=fa43dd2eeb9d9a18f4f710ca8&amp;id=919a010a82">ticket pre-sale is tomorrow</a> (starting at 5 a.m.!) via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235206/http://subscribe.livingsocial.com/deals/socialads_reflector?gclid=CPa5g8C8r64CFYmK4Aodz1w_QA&amp;do_not_redirect=1&amp;ref=google_national_nationalsearch&amp;geo=true&amp;ef_id=KPdOV7JGWlUAAE1E:20120221161954:s">Living Social</a>. General ticket sales will start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424235206/http://govball-govballneonbox.eventbrite.com/">Friday at 10 a.m.</a> (prices start at $95 for one day, not including transportation). They announced the lineup this morning via the below video (you can also scroll down for it):</p>

<p>There will also be art installations, food trucks, and &quot;high end beer,&quot; wine and spirits. One bonus of the venue change: In addition to being accessible by bus, foot, bike, car, and cab, the festival will provide shuttle bus service from Williamsburg, and ferry service from Mid-Town Manhattan to and from the festival grounds.<br>
