                            <p>If you leave your apartment today and find yourself outside for more than ten minutes, your legs will feel like they are burning. This is <em>with</em> pants on. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209184015/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2014/01/05/go-home-arctic-youre-drunk/">The Arctic got drunk</a> and wants to cuddle with us for a day or two, and even if the Arctic doesn&apos;t mean to intentionally hurt us during this brief fling, that doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t happen. And if it happens you have to know that it&apos;s not the Arctic, <em>it&apos;s you</em>. If you get hurt during this flirtation with subzero-feeling temperatures, it&apos;s because you didn&apos;t prepare yourself. </p>

<p>To protect yourself from the Arctic&apos;s bite, all you need to do is wear protective armor. Today is not a day to leave your pants at home. The pants will protect you. It&apos;s that easy. And yet one man was spotted&#x2014;by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209184015/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/">DNAInfo</a> reporter Katie Honan&#x2014;baring his <strike>soul</strike> shins on the subway this morning in a pair of shorts... capris... manpris? Whatever they are, they are absolutely inappropriate for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209184015/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/07/nyc_polar_vortex_big_deal.php">Polar Vortex conditions</a>. In fact, do not do this until June... and even then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209184015/http://www.theawl.com/2009/04/can-i-wear-shorts">it&apos;s pretty questionable</a>.</p>
