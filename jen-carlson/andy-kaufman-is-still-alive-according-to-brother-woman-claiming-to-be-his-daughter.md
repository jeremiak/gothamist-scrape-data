These rumors have been around since Kaufman died in 1984, mostly kept alive via tongue-in-cheek comments from Bob Zmuda, who had said Kaufman was &quot;obsessed&quot; with the idea of faking his own death. But at this week&apos;s event, Kaufman&apos;s brother Michael claimed it to be all true, and that Kaufman has been living in obscurity the past 29 years of his life, raising a family. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005112/http://defamer.gawker.com/is-andy-kaufman-still-alive-1463790778/@maxread">Defamer</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005112/http://thecomicscomic.com/2013/11/12/woman-claiming-to-be-late-andy-kaufmans-daughter-upstages-2013-andy-kaufman-awards/">The Comic&apos;s Comic</a>, &quot;Michael shared a story of finding his brother&apos;s elaborate plans to fake his own death after Andy had passed on, along with a note that he would reappear on Christmas Eve 1999 at his favorite restaurant. Michael went to the restaurant, and though Andy never showed, a letter was handed to him that explained that Andy had gone into hiding to live a normal life and now had a wife and daughter&#x2014;but didn&apos;t want anyone to find out while the Kaufmans&apos; father Stanley was still alive.&quot; Stanley passed away over the summer. </p>

<p>Following the incident in 1999, a 24-year-old woman approached Michael, reportedly claiming to be his daughter. She was at the event this week, and Kelly Dwyer, who was in attendance, reported back on Facebook:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Ok. Tonight was a mindfuck. Anyone who was there will attest. Andy Kaufman&apos;s daughter came onstage and claimed he was alive. It was. It was...I can&apos;t tell you how it was, only that it was as real as any reality that i&apos;ve seen. and yeah. I get that it is - could - might all be a hoax. That was the only and last thing I want to say. it was fucking fucked up. She said he is alive and that the passing of his father this July made him want to reach out via her- to Michael, Andy&apos;s brother. She said he is watching the award entries, semi and finalists with great interest always. He just wanted to disappear. To be a father. To be an observer. As much as this seems like bullshit as I type it, it was as real as anything I&apos;ve ever seen. There is video. It was chilling, upsetting and absolutely intriguing. I bawled my eyes out. The entire room was freaked out. It was, if nothing else, brilliant. and incredibly mindfuckng and AWESOME.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>If you have video from the night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005112/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">pass it along</a>! Some say the girl was a theater student, some say they want to believe, some believe in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005112/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/andy-kaufmans-hangin-elvis-0">the Death Certificate</a>, some say he&apos;s in Albuquerque...</p>

<p>If Kaufman didn&apos;t die of lung cancer, he&apos;d be 64 years old.</p>
