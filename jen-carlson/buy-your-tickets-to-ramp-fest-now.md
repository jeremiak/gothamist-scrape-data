<p>As we wait for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405020452/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">the Great Ramp</a> to rise from the ground and show up at our local greenmarket, let&apos;s think some more about them. And what they&apos;re doing right now. And what our ramps doll made with leftover ramp leaves and twine is doing right now. And how special they are. So special that they get an annual festival dedicated to them&#x2014;they are the holiest of holy, they are bigger than Jesus, &quot;Yo, fiddlehead ferns, I&apos;mma let you finish but ramps are the best vegetable of all time,&quot; <em>they are so good when churned into pesto.</em></p>

<p>Even though we won&apos;t be seeing these garlicky wonders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405020452/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/where_are_the_ramps.php">for a couple more weeks</a>, that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t start planning our journey to Hudson, NY. Tickets for Ramp Fest&#x2014;taking place on May 4th&#x2014;are on sale NOW for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405020452/http://www.rampfesthudson.com/pages/tickets.html">just $30</a>.
