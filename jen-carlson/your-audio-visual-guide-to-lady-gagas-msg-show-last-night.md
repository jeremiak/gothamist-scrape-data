</div></div><p>Last night&#x2014;after walking around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231712/http://beta.gothamist.com/2011/02/21/guess_which_pop_superstar_forgot_he.php">sans pants</a> all day&#x2014;Lady Gaga took the stage at MSG for one of her hometown shows (she&apos;s there again tonight) which will air on HBO in May. Dan Meade (who took some photographs around MSG of her <strike>fans</strike> monsters, says, it &quot;all felt like a cross between Harajuku and the Village Halloween Parade. Then, when I realized that we were standing there, cameras poised, waiting for get The Shot of people in Fame Monster outfits... it all started to get way too meta. And Weird. And a little disturbing.&quot;</p>

<p>Here she is singing <em>Born This Way</em> last night, acapella-style... it sounds less like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231712/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/14/lady_gaga_vs_late_80s_madonna.php"><em>Express Yourself</em></a> that way.</p>
