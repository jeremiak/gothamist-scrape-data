                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="clohole1211.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232917im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/clohole1211.jpeg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We&apos;ve written about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232917/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> plenty of times over the years, and it&apos;s always really easy to write sensational headlines or snarky commentary that aims to take her down a notch. But truth be told, we have admired Courtney Love for quite some time (approximately 17 years), or at the very least, enjoyed her work. Also, there is no meaningful satisfaction to be gained from spinning a lexical web of insults around anyone. So, today word got out via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232917/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/love_faces_townhouse_boot_oNPP2s03wSF27YkUWy1QCM">Page Six</a> that Love is getting evicted from her West Village townhouse after falling behind on rent and, according to owner Donna Lyon, damaging and altering the property. You can read about it all over the internet, but that&apos;s all we have to say about it. Instead, let&apos;s focus on not hating Courtney Love for a while? Here are some things to keep in mind:<br>
</p><ul><li>Courtney Love did not kill Kurt Cobain.<br>
</li><li>No, she is not perfect, but her fucking husband died and she got accused of killing him, and has since been attacked for pretty much every move she&apos;s made. You&apos;d probably be a little damaged too.<br>
</li><li>Still, she tried to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232917/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg3fIfqRu74&amp;feature=fvst">comfort Kurt&apos;s fans</a> right after his death.<br>
</li><li>Her band Hole put out some pretty kick ass songs that got many women you probably know through some tough times in high school.<br>
</li><li>Yes, chances are that any woman you know of a certain 20 or 30-something age almost definitely has a soft spot for Love, and almost definitely blasted <em>Live Through This</em> in her car at some point in life as a release. It probably looked like this:</li></ul><br>

<ul><li>Sure, Love is most likely a little bit crazy, and some of that may or may not have to do with past drug use, but aren&apos;t the most interesting people in life a little bit crazy? As Winona Ryder&apos;s character in <em>Girl, Interrupted</em> said, &quot;Crazy isn&#x2019;t being broken, or swallowing a dark secret. It&#x2019;s you or me, amplified.&quot; <br>
</li><li>If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232917/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBTl611c9fs">you had to choose</a> between hanging out with Madonna and hanging out with Courtney... can you honestly say you&apos;d pick Madonna? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232917/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN3S2o2CxmY"><em>Really?</em></a><br>
</li><li>And in conclusion: Baby doll dresses!</li></ul><p></p>

<p>There you go. Can we just let the woman paint her West Village walls &quot;ice blue&quot; or whatever paint color she wants without derision? (Just don&apos;t huff <em>too</em> much of it all at once, Courtney!)</p>
