<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="thylanevogue20811.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/thylanevogue20811.jpg" width="250" height="296" class="image-right"> </span>A French model is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://jezebel.com/5828748/the-10+year+old-french-models-mother-responds-to-the-controversy-over-her-daughters-pictures">causing a stir</a> thanks to a &quot;bad person in the U.S.A.&quot;... and also because she&apos;s only 10-years-old. Thylane Loubry Blondeau has been posing and posturing amongst the industry&apos;s elite, but many think the young girl is being pushed too far, getting a little too grown up for photo spreads in magazines like French Vogue. Lest we forget, Brooke Shields was just 10-years-old when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/30/brooke_shields.php">this controversial photo</a> was taken, and that controversy has stuck around for decades. Blondeau&apos;s mother Veronika Loubry allegedly defended her daughter on Facebook, saying:</p>

<blockquote>hey guys im the mum of thylane something going &#x2018;s wrong at the moment with thylane and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/10-year-vogue-model-young-young-14229482"><strong>bad personn in usa</strong></a> about pictures she make&apos;s 8 months ago for vogue ,,thylane doesn&apos;t know about the buzz and i want to protect her from the deapest of my heart ,,, she&apos;s so young ,, so we are going to close this accompte for a while ,,i know all of you are good person who like her so i send you a big kiss,,thanks</blockquote>

Should 10-year-olds stick to playing dress up? </p>

<p>The fashion industry seems to be getting younger and younger as a whole, with teenagers taking over as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1838809,00.html">designers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://www.thestylerookie.com/">fashion writers</a>, and models (Dakota Fanning&apos;s 13-year-old sister is the new face <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://racked.com/archives/2011/07/06/elle-fannings-marc-by-marc-jacobs-fall-campaign.php">of Marc Jacobs</a>).  Of course, the fashion industry is teeming with possibly age-inappropriate things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/17/babikinis_when_babies_need_their_ow.php">babikinis</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205170743/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/26/who_wouldnt_get_their_7-year-old_a.php">padded bras for 7-year-olds</a>, too.</p>
