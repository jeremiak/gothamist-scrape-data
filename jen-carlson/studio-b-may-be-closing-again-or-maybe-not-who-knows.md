At least, it seems that way with the help of rampant rumors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150213235331/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/06/studio_b_closin.html">Brooklyn Vegan</a> reported on the latest from the Greenpoint club/rumor factory, saying &quot;word is that Brooklyn mostly-dance club Studio B is really closing this time&#x2014;by the end of July.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150213235331/http://clubstudiob.com/calendar.html">Their website</a> currently lists events through July 12th, and an upcoming 2 Live Crew show on July 25th is being moved from the venue. We&apos;ve contacted Studio B for a statement but have not heard back yet; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150213235331/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/23/studio_b_wont_die.php">last time</a> around they told us: &quot;Studio B is not closed and will be open at least until the beginning of February for sure. Mid February the decision will be made to weather or not the club will keeps its doors open.&quot; Raise your hand if you care either way!<p></p>
