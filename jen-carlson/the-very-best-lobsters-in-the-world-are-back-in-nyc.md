This is your big day.&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511041117/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTO57M3KgA">Homer Simpson</a></i></div> The Fourchu Lobster (labeled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511041117/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/test_driving_the_rolls_royce_of_lob.php">the Rolls Royce of Lobster</a>) has returned to New York City. The rare creatures&#x2014;which hail from the freezing cold waters off the tiny village of Fourchu on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia&#x2014;are rich and <em>delicious</em>, and have been compared to delicacies like Wagyu Beef and Italian White Truffles. <p></p>

<p>Not sold yet? Dorothy Cann Hamilton, founder of the International Culinary Center, says they are &quot;without question, the very best lobsters in the world.&quot; She has been working hand-in-hand with local fishermen, &quot;who catch these lobsters safely and sustainably, to bring this exciting opportunity to New Yorkers.&quot;</p>

<p>The Fourchus are currently being housed in a &quot;lobster living room&quot; (!) in Bushwick, and from there they are making their way into the capable hands of select chefs around the city. If you want to try one, head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511041117/http://www.lecolenyc.com/">L&apos;Ecole</a> in Manhattan, where you can get a Fourchu lobster steamed on a platter, or as a lobster roll ($18). These offerings will be available until August, at which time the Fourchus will disappear again for another year.</p>
