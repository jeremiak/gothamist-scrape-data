They write:</p><blockquote>&quot;I live on the first floor, and I know for a fact that there&apos;s a drug dealer in my building. I can hear the transactions happening since they&apos;re actually dumb enough to think their voices don&apos;t travel through my door when they&apos;re standing right next to it. This makes me extremely uncomfortable to know that this type of activity is so close to home. I want to call the police and report this, but I also am wary of the &apos;don&apos;t snitch&apos; edict in this neighborhood. I should also mention that even when not dealing, this guy and some friends are usually smoking blunts in the hallway from 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. on weeknights.&quot;</blockquote>Quite the pickle! You&apos;d think all that second-hand pot smoke would make this person chill out, but considering pot-dealing is a gateway to murdering your neighbors on the first floor, we guess they have reason for concern. To narc or not to narc&#x2014;any advice?
