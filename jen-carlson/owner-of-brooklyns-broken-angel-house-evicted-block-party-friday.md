<p>Artist Arthur Wood is losing his Clinton Hill home, which he purchased in the 1970s with his late wife, and the neighborhood will send him off with a block party this Friday. The 84-year-old has been struggling to keep his unique living space&#x2014;known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229204241/http://gothamist.com/tags/brokenangel">Broken Angel</a> house and highlighted in the 2005 documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229204241/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425598/"><em>Dave Chappelle&apos;s Block Party</em></a>&#x2014;for years. Throughout his time there he has turned the building into a livable sculpture.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This beautiful artistic landmark has inspired many people with it&apos;s intricate arches, stunning, gravity defying angles and it&apos;s sheer asymmetry in a landscape which is all too dull and predictable. Much of the material it was built from was sourced from the garbage and dumps of NYC.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>When the structure caught fire in 2006, the Department of Buildings came snooping around and deemed it unsafe&#x2014;the order to vacate led to arrests and a long foreclosure battle, and now Wood is being evicted. It&apos;s unclear what will happen to the building, but last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229204241/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/broken_angel.php">a failed Kickstarter</a> aimed to turn it into a museum.</p>

<p>Organizers promise bands, BBQ, and plenty of art at this Friday&apos;s send-off, which will be held outside of the home at 4-8 Downing Street between 4 and 9 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229204241/https://www.facebook.com/events/161209154034526/">More details can be found here</a>.</p>
