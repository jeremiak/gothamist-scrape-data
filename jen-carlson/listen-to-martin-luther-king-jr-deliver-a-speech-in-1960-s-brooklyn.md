<p>On February 10th, 1963 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a speech at the historic Plymouth Church in Brooklyn Heights&#x2014;it was called &#x201C;The American Dream,&#x201D; and echoes of it were heard in his &#x201C;I Have a Dream&#x201D; speech later that year. He began, as he often did while at speaking engagements like that one, by thanking those in front of him:</p><blockquote>I need not pause to say how very delighted I am to have the privilege of standing in this historic spot, this sacred spot, the opportunity of being in this church so rich in history and with such a rich tradition. It is always a deep and rewarding experience when I can take a brief break from the day-to-day demands of our struggle for freedom and human dignity in the south, and discuss issues involved in that struggle with people of good will over this nation. And so I say I&apos;m delighted to be here, and I am deeply grateful...</blockquote>The church (which Abraham Lincoln attended twice) was founded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427235740/http://www.plymouthchurch.org/history">in 1847</a>, and is believed to have been a part of the Underground Railroad. That, and its history of advocating for human rights, prompted King to accept their invite on that date, which was the day the church became a National Historic Landmark.<p></p>

<p>The church&apos;s director of history ministry services, Lois Rosebrooks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427235740/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/nyregion/the-keeper-of-the-institutional-memory-of-a-famed-brooklyn-church-steps-down.html">who recently retired</a>, was there the day MLK, Jr. took over preaching duties, as part of the choir. She recalled it being &#x201C;jampacked&quot; that day. Here&apos;s the speech, which he also delivered elsewhere around that time.</p>
