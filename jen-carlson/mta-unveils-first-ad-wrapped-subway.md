This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418121317/http://mta.info/mta/news/releases/?en=081002-HQ36">the MTA unveiled</a> the first &quot;full advertising wrap of the exterior and interior of a New York City subway.&quot; Synergy alert! The ad is for the History Channel&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418121317/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?mini_id=53900"><em>Cities of the Underworld</em></a>, which follows urban explorer Don Wildman on his adventures beneath major cities. Adventures happening ever further down from the ones New Yorkers experience on the 42nd Street Shuttle.</p>

<p>The underground ad campaign is a bit underwhelming, <em>but</em> it is in an effort to further expand the MTA&apos;s advertising revenue base, and in addition they&apos;ll also be testing digital advertising on buses <em>and</em> in-car commuter rails. The MTA noted that they &quot;will realize over $125 million in 2008 in advertising revenues. If these new initiatives are implemented on a permanent base, the MTA expects these revenues to grow substantially.&quot; Which could only help <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418121317/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/24/mtas_latest_budget_forecast_means_f.php">at this point</a>.</p>
