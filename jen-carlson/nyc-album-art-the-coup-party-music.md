What you see pictured was the planned cover art for The Coup&apos;s <em>Party Music</em> album, designed in June 2001.</p>

<p>Boots Riley, the guy in the forefront holding what looks like a detonator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034431/http://www.snopes.com/rumors/thecoup.htm">explains</a> his...unfortunate idea: &quot;I came up with the idea with the photographer. We took the pictures on May 15, and we were done with it by the beginning of June. Any similarities are totally coincidental, and it was originally supposed to be more of a metaphor for destroying capitalism &#x2014; where the music is making capitalist towers blow up. The politics of the Coup have more to do with the people organizing each other.&quot;</p>

<p>Since the album wasn&apos;t getting released until November of 2001, the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034431/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/09/46771">pulled the art</a> from websites and created a new one after 9/11. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034431/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/32128-the-coup-to-change-cover-to-non-wtc-disaster">Pitchfork</a> reported on the art change, they mentioned that &quot;Riley had requested that the band be allowed to keep the artwork despite the terrorist attacks, but 75Ark would not allow it, calling the cover wholly inappropriate.&quot; The new image?
