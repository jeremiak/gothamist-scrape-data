<p>If you haven&apos;t booked your six-figure summer rental in the Hamptons yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429115628/http://www.corcoran.com/hamptons/Listings/Display/2481086">Corcoran has a listing</a> for the legendary Grey Gardens estate, where you&apos;ll get to eat lobster rolls and drink fine Chardonnay with the ghost of Little Edie on Georgica Beach.</p>

<p>The estate, famously documented by Albert and David Maysles in their 1975 documentary, has been back in a livable condition for some time now. However, when the filmmakers were capturing it decades ago, Edith &quot;Big Edie&quot; Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edith &quot;Little Edie&quot; Bouvier Beale were living in squalor. But the cat-hoarding days are long gone, and the listing promises pristine conditions worth your $125,000 (this is the price for June and July).</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A piece of American folk lore can be yours from now until the end of July when you rent East Hamptons fabled Grey Gardens 2 acre estate with pool and tennis next to Georgica Beach. Originally designed by Joseph Greenleaf Thorpe in 1897, this 6000 Hampton orginal, was totally renovated and restored to its orginally condition with the addition of today&apos;s amenities when the current owners rescued it some 30 years ago.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>If you rent it, BYO-American Flag, and let us know if you hear cats meowing in the dark of the night.
