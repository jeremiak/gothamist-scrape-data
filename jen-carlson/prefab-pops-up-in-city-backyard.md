Design*Sponge points out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102717/http://www.kithaus.com/">a Kithaus</a> in Williamsburg, whose &quot;location required each module to be carried, by hand, through a 3 story brick rowhouse. The builders then added custom decks and wedged it in between warehouses and light industrial buildings to create this compact urban oasis.&quot; Prepare to be jealous as you feast your eyes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102717/http://www.designspongeonline.com/2008/08/kithaus-brooklyn.html">upon the results</a>. If you want one of your own, a basic kit runs around $40K.
