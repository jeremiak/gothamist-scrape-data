<p>Diaz has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192809/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/17081865/arnold-diaz">won 44 Emmys</a> throughout his career&#x2014;before Fox he was at WCBS (where his &quot;Shame On You&quot; series ran), and ABC&apos;s 20/20. In total he&apos;s been exposing and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192809/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/28/video_united_homeless_organization.php">shaming scammers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192809/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/05/busted_escalators_now_enter_hall_of.php">government agencies</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192809/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/greenwich_village_bakery_selling_dr.php">racist bakers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192809/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/healthy_ice_cream_shop_sues_after_f.php">ice cream shops</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192809/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/02/video_martha_stewart_lounge_chairs.php">Martha Stewart</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502192809/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/11/parking_lot_caught_selling_metered.php">whoever else he thought deserved</a> it for about 30 years.</p>

The same sources [says] investigative reports will no longer come just from specialized units at the station.&quot; However, VP of WNYW wants &quot;to thank him for his many contributions to FOX 5.&quot;</p>
