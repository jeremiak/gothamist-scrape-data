<p>Move over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124161825/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/20/magda_sayeg_knittaplease.php">Knitta Please</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124161825/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/27/spotted_wall_street_bull_warms_up_w.php">Olek</a> (whose show is opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124161825/http://brooklynbased.net/blog/made-in-brooklyn-olek/">tonight</a>)... 57-year-old Laurie Russell has just been exposed as the woman behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124161825/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/21/cute_brooklyn_trees_bundle_up.php">the trio of trees</a> adorned in knit in Park Slope. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124161825/http://parkslope.patch.com/articles/tree-sweater-mystery-solved">Park Slope Patch</a>, that&apos;s who has been keeping the trees on 16th Street (between 6th and 7th avenues) warm for the winter. She told them: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;I knit as a hobby, and I was tired of making scarves. I had knit one or two sweaters, but I&#x2019;m not a very advanced knitter. I was looking at dogs, sausage dogs, and think about what a fun sweater shape that would be. But I don&#x2019;t have a dog. So I started looking at trees as a simple sweater.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Russell had no idea she was part of a budding community of knitting street artists, though says her saffron-colored piece was an ode to Christo and Jeanne-Claude&apos;s The Gates. She&apos;s been at it for years, and says she dresses her first tree in mid-December of each year, removing them when spring approaches. Can any Fashion Week people tell us what&apos;s &quot;in&quot; for trees this Spring?</p>
