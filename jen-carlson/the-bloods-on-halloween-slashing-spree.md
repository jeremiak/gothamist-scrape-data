The Bloods are out all day and tonight working on their initiations. Supposedly they have to slice 31 people to get initiated into the gang?&quot; And another reader writes, &quot;I have a friend at a hospital uptown, and she said word is that a few victims are currently being treated.&quot; </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027004405/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/violence-expected-in-east-harlem.html">NYC the Blog</a> updated their post with word from a message board that this isn&apos;t a rumor, &quot;officers in precincts all over NY and NJ have been issued memos and put on high alert.<strong> The Bloods initiation is today, tomorrow (Halloween), and Saturday. </strong>People who want to be initiated into the gang must each kill 31 women (women of all ages) in drive by shootings.&quot; They really set the bar high in this gang! </p>

<p>Well, truth or rumor, knife-slicing or drive-by, it never hurts to be extra cautious out there, kiddos. Especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151027004405/http://www.williamsburgisdead.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/10/uh-oh-gang-initiation-today-in-williamsburg.html">if you&apos;re in Williamsburg</a>!

We know nothing specific about this threat. </strong>We&apos;ve heard it because people were talking about what&apos;s out there, on the internet, but we have no specific information to indicate that there&apos;s any validity to this rumor.&quot;  </p>

<p>NY1 adds, &quot;Kelly said Halloween is always a night for potential vandalism and police will be on heightened alert.&quot;</p>
