It&apos;s illegal, but Bloomberg created a huge gray area when in 2003 he declared that wine consumption at Central Park concerts was a-okay. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173725/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2008/08/is_your_stoop_p.php">Brownstoner</a> focuses in on stoop drinking after a Park Slope man received a $25 open container violation ticket for enjoying a brewskie &quot;after Biden&apos;s speech&quot; when a patrol car with an observant cop came by.  The officer &quot;explained that if I was behind a fence or gate I would be ok. Since we don&apos;t have a gate, the set-back from the sidewalk didn&apos;t matter.&quot; The NYPD press office hasn&apos;t responded to our question about whether stoop drinking is okay yet, so we&apos;ll take that as a yes. Besides, in 2005 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173725/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/fashion/sundaystyles/28stoop.html?pagewanted=all">the NY Times</a> all but encouraged stoop parties.</p>
