The attractive, talented and wealthy actor, who landed the cover of the legendary magazine for his role on one of the best shows on television, took a moment out from living the dream to complain about getting too much attention for having a large penis.<p></p>

<p>Hamm has sent this message out the people of the internet: &quot;They&apos;re called &apos;privates&apos; for a reason. I&apos;m wearing pants, for fuck&apos;s sake. Lay off. I mean, it&apos;s not like I&apos;m a fucking lead miner. There are harder jobs in the world. <strong>But when people feel the freedom to create Tumblr accounts about my cock, I feel like that wasn&apos;t part of the deal.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Hamm is referring to the Tumblr called &quot;Jon Hamm&apos;s Wang,&quot; which has been going for two years strong. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144438/http://jonhammswang.tumblr.com/post/35190823265">Some of the photos are pretty unbelievable</a>, like, is he just fucking with us now by shoving stuffed animals down there?</p>

<p>Anyway, having contributed to the problem with a post titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144438/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/jon_hamms_ham.php">13 Photos Of Jon Hamm&apos;s, You Know... &quot;Ham&quot;</a>, we would like to take a moment to apologize to Jon Hamm&apos;s ham&#x2014;we&apos;re sorry, you never asked for this kind of attention.  </p>
