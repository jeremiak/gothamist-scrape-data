<span class="photo_caption">The Aviation cocktail on <em>The Blacklist</em> was way too blue.</span></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="1013AviationCocktail.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509065714im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/1013AviationCocktail.jpg" width="290" height="350" class="image-right"> </span>This week on <em>The Blacklist</em> (that new show starring James Spader, aka Steff from <em>Pretty In Pink</em>), Spader&apos;s character Raymond Reddington takes FBI agent Elizabeth Keen out for dinner where he surprises her with a deep blue Aviation cocktail. He tells her, &quot;It&apos;s from the &apos;20s, tastes like spring, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>

<p>The cocktail&#x2014;which features gin, maraschino liqueur, cr&#xE8;me de violette, and lemon juice&#x2014;is usually lighter purple/paler blue in tone, and it actually dates back to at least 1911. It was created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509065714/http://www.finecooking.com/item/23567/the-great-aviation-cocktail-mystery">Hugo Ensslin</a>, head bartender at the Hotel Wallick on Broadway and 43rd Street, and first turned up in print in 1916&apos;s <em>Recipes for Mixed Drinks</em>. Ensslin used: 1&#xBD; oz. El Bart gin, &#xBE; oz. lemon juice, 2 dashes maraschino liqueur, and 2 dashes cr&#xE8;me de violette (serve chilled, no ice). Later incarnations of the recipe eliminated the cr&#xE8;me de violette, making it more sour and stripping it of its otherworldly hue.</p>

<p>The drink never really <em>took flight</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509065714/http://cold-glass.com/2010/06/23/aviation-cocktail/">according to</a> some historical look backs, &quot;Its obscurity seems a combination of bad luck and an uncommon-ingredients recipe... there is no indication that Aviation, the cocktail, was the fashionable drink of its day.&quot;</p>

<p>Cr&#xE8;me de violette &quot;disappeared from the United States in the 1960s,&quot; but reappeared in 2007, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509065714/http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=18483">you can find it today</a> if you want to recreate the classic version of the drink. As this guy says, it&apos;s &quot;the only blue cocktail you should ever consider&quot;:</p>

<p>As for why it&apos;s called The Aviation... just look at the color of the sky.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509065714/http://www.thejakewalk.com/">The JakeWalk</a> in Brooklyn makes a terrific Aviation, complete with cr&#xE8;me de violette.</p>
