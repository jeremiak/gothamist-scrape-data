</div></div>					<p>Seeing images of a dismantled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321001714/http://gothamist.com/tags/statueofliberty">Statue of Liberty</a> always invokes apocalyptic feelings. Even these shots of Lady Liberty before she was standing tall have a <em>Planet of the Apes</em> feel. These are all images before she was fully assembled in 1886 &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321001714/http://www.endex.com/gf/buildings/liberty/libertyfacts/solsciam08141886/solsciam08141886.htm">Scientific American</a> explained at the time how the ol&apos; gal arrived from France (with assembly instructions that read like an IKEA instruction manual!). All in all she consisted of 350 individual pieces, which were all shipped to the States in 214 crates. More facts about the Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Auguste Bartholdi statue can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321001714/http://www.nyc-architecture.com/LM/LM002-STATUEOFLIBERTY.htm">found here</a>.</p>
