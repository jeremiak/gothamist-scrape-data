<p>In NYC we don&apos;t always know our neighbors very well, but thanks to data collection we can get a general sense of their political leanings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130612/https://www.renthop.com/study/new-york-city-ny/new-york-donors.html">Renthop has created</a> the below map, which lets you click on any neighborhood to find out which candidates its residents throw the most money at. To create this, the company&apos;s &quot;data scientists crunched the numbers from FEC.gov on New York&#x2019;s campaign contributions&quot;... and what they found will probably not shock you. Here&apos;s a little breakdown:<br>
</p><ul><li>Young progressive enclaves like Williamsburg are pushing hard for Bernie&#x2014;the 11211 zip has donated $30,000 more to his campaign than Hillary&apos;s.<br>
</li><li>Ridgewood, Queens is also feelin&apos; the Bern.<br>
</li><li>Wealthy areas are going all in on Hillary&#x2014;in Brooklyn Heights, where more 0s are attached to the checks, Hillary has received nearly $400,000 more than Bernie.<br>
</li><li>The Upper East Side is more supportive of Hillary than Bernie, whereas the Upper West Side is more evened out in their support for the two.<br>
</li><li>The most Donald Trump seems to have received is $10,537 from the Upper East Side.<br>
</li><li>Most NYC republicans are going for Marco Rubio, who has received his top donations ($106,000 total) from Midtown East.<br>
</li><li>The most generous neighborhood across the board has been the Upper East Side, where residents have contributed to $1.23 million to the candidates.</li></ul><p></p>
