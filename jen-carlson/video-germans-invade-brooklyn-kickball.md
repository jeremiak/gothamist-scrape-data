										<p>There&apos;s not a lot to add commentary-wise to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422212539/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOC3Hk46azI&amp;">this video</a>, which is a German report on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422212539/http://www.brooklynkickball.com/">Brooklyn kickball league</a>. Hipsters, Germans, a Beavis and Butthead quote... it&apos;s well worth your 6 minutes and 43 seconds.</p>

<p>Fluent in German? Feel free to translate for us, we&apos;d love to know what the Deutsche really think of the Never Scared team captain.</p>
