In fact, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142332/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704448304575196110880930850.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal says</a> they&apos;ve infested every nook of the neighborhood, from stores to car engines. <p></p>

<p>Some locals are blaming the 2nd Avenue subway project (previously blamed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142332/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/11/subway_sickness_1.php">for sickness</a>), and say once the sun sets the rats come out in waves. One said, &quot;It looks like the street&apos;s moving. It&apos;s just wild. You can&apos;t imagine how infested this place became.&quot; Surely the recent slashing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142332/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/31/rats_3.php">of pest control jobs</a> by the city won&apos;t be helping to quell the problem.</p>

<p>A contractor managing the project told the MTA that the blasting &quot;may be exacerbating a pre-existing condition&quot;&#x2014;but in the end the effect continuous explosions have on rats is unknown. Currently the main problem seems to be where they&apos;re excavating a giant cavern underground between 91st and 95th Streets (readying for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142332/http://gothamist.com/tags/tunnelboringmachine">tunnel boring machine</a>). The project is expected to last 8 more years, and one expert says during that time lots of the rodents will be killed, but perhaps even more will get away. As one resident put it: &quot;We are, until 2018, in a living hell.&quot;</p>
