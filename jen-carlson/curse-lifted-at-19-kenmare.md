Well, it ain&apos;t happenin&apos; friends. </p>

<p>19 Kenmare Street has been vacant now for over a year, and what&apos;s housed behind the plywood in what used to be Little Charlie&#x2019;s Clam Bar, isn&apos;t a rock legend-run nightclub. Just this past Wednesday, prior to a community board meeting regarding the spot, the Bowery Presents folk (whose Bowery Ballroom venue is just down the street) emailed their list of contacts asking for support of the restaurant, Travertine, hoping to open there (on top of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124156/http://www.observer.com/2008/real-estate/travertine-breaks-curse-19-kenmare">cursed address</a>, the restaurant has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124156/http://eater.com/archives/2008/08/first_word_yet_another_group_takes_a_crack_at_19_kenmare.php">traveling a long and tortured road</a>). </p>

But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124156/http://eater.com/archives/2008/09/first_word_14.php">Eater</a> notes that some weren&apos;t as lucky. Beatrice Inn, for example, was denied a liquor license renewal...what will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124156/http://gawker.com/5047248/the-definitive-guide-to-the-beatrice-inn">Mary Kate</a> do?!</p>
