<p>Every year, a majestic tree is sacrificed in the name of <strike>commercialism&#x2014;this annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050120/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/04/rockefeller_tree_2014.php">promotional tree slaughter</a> has been</strike> bringing many Americans joy, but in the past it has brought me <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050120/http://gothaist.com/tags/deadtree">nothing but pain</a>. Luckily, I have spent the past year being reprogrammed through a series of intense &quot;voluntary&quot; workshops.</p>

<p>My &quot;support&quot; group included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050120/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/07/dead_tree_here_happy_christmas.php">the Sigafoos family</a>, a man wearing a tattered Santa suit who goes only by the name of Norman even though that is clearly not his name, and David Miscavige. Al Roker was the leader, and he &quot;suggested&quot; that whenever we convened we all call him that. Even David.</p>

<p>It&apos;s been a crazy year with these folks, and I would not be here today typing this, as they stand right behind me, without them. I&apos;d probably be typing one of my sensationalized headlines instead, like &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050120/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/execution_date_set_for_local_tree.php">Rockefeller Center Arboreal Bloodlust Will Soon Be Sated By Local Tree Execution</a>.&quot; But today, I&apos;m here to thank these people for helping me with my first kill.</p>

<span class="photo_caption">&quot;Why are you doing this to us?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050120/http://www.midhudsonnews.com/News/2015/November/05/RC_tree-05Nov15.html">the Asendorf family</a> asked. I handed them a pamphlet for The Program. (AP)</span></p>

<p>Yesterday, in the quiet of Ulster County, NY, I stood before a 78-foot Norway spruce, and I gathered the strength I needed to take it down. It helped me to give it a name, so I called the tree I was about to slaughter &quot;Norman.&quot; Even though that is clearly not its name. I pictured it in a tattered Santa suit, booze on its breath, fidgeting <em>always fidgeting</em>, as if trying to expel the evil from his soul. &quot;Hand me the ax,&quot; I whispered to David, who was holding the ax because Leader Al was no longer allowed near sharp objects per the NY State Police following an incident earlier that morning.</p>

<p>It took many, many hours, but I felled that 10-ton tree all on my own. There were tears, blisters, shouting, I had to stop once to be RE-reprogrammed, and in the end: acceptance. This is who I am now. I will murder for you, America. </p>

<p>If you don&apos;t believe me, here&apos;s a photo which shows the shadows of myself, Leader Al, and Gaby Sigafoos, my sponsor. David&apos;s shadow didn&apos;t show up, but he was there too! </p>
