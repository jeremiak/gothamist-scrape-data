With everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180037/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/02/everyones_a_voy.php">HBO&apos;s Voyeur</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180037/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/25/band_in_a_bubbl.php">watching a band in a bubble</a>, we wish this were enough to satiate those creepy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180037/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/08/legal_aid_peepi.php">peeping tom&apos;s</a> out there!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180037/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/09/arts/09slow.html">The NY Times</a> now reports on Li&#xE1;n Amaris Sifuentes and her &#x201C;Fashionably Late for the Relationship&#x201D; performance, which recently lasted 72-hours and will soon be compressed in to a 72-minute film which shows her preparing for a date. At the the southeast corner of Union Square, Sifuentes&apos; goal was to garner &quot;attention to the private feminine ritual not only by performing it in full view of the Manhattan public, but also by performing it deliberately.&quot; In her preparation she looked in the mirror, took a disco nap, tried on dresses, drank some wine...all slowed down to a pace that would make the average woman seem to get ready in a flash.</p>

<p>While the live performance prolonged each step (drinking the glass of wine took seven hours), the film will show her getting ready at a normal speed (with passerby going so fast they&apos;ll seem like a blur). Since the performance was being filmed in such a high traffic area, there are sure to be plenty of those blurry extras: </p>

<blockquote>Generally people stayed clear, whether out of courtesy or affected indifference. It didn&#x2019;t help that in Union Square on Saturday &#x201C;Fashionably&#x201D; was competing for attention with the usual drum circles, art vendors, &#x201C;Free Palestine&#x201D; people, &#x201C;Free Hugs&#x201D; people, skateboarders and the farmers&#x2019; market.

<p>Mr. DuBois, who had not anticipated such a big, intimidating production, was a little frustrated, knowing that spectators lingering in front of the camera both would make a more interesting effect in the film and be good for the performance. Production assistants encouraged people to walk through.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Of course, many asked questions as they passed through, such as &quot;when is she going to strip?&quot; while others just had some directorial advice. Maybe they should have left a tip jar, because if you&apos;ve ever wondered how much something like this would cost to do, the final budget was around $45K, which they narrowed down from $100K with a little help from friends and volunteers. If they waited much longer, the film probably wouldn&apos;t have happened at all due to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180037/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/29/city_proposes_l.php">possible new restrictions</a>. </p>
