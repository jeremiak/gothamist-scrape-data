<p>Overnight internet sensation Ryan Gosling has finally spoken out about that somewhat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405004157/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/video_ryan_gosling_breaks_up_nyc_st.php">awkward scuffle</a> he jumped into earlier this summer, right on the mean streets of Astor Place. The then unknown Gosling decided to break up a fight going down in the middle of an intersection, where a man had been stopped after stealing a painting. Gosling eventually paid the artist for the work, and the thief was sent on his way with the stolen item, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405004157/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/more_video_ryan_gosling_hero_or_art.php">learning absolutely nothing</a> about the consequences of his actions. Because everything is, this was all caught on tape and later put into the YouTubes, making the young man famous (he&apos;s even since been cast in a movie called <em>Drive</em> which we hear is really good). <a 688971="" href="a href=" http:="" www.mtv.com="" videos="" movies="" ryan-gosling-addresses-viral-street-fight.jhtml"="">Watch him blush</a> below&#x2014;this kid&apos;s got a future!:</p>

<blockquote>I&apos;m embarrassed. I think the guy really was stealing that other guys painting, so I should have just kept my nose out of it. It was sad... I said to the guy, &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; He said, &quot;Well he tried to steal my painting.&quot; I said, &quot;How do you know?&quot; He said, &quot;Well he comes here everyday and looks at my paintings.&quot; Which means, the guy was a fan. And so he wanted the painting so bad he had to steal it because he couldn&apos;t afford it. So he finally steals the painting, and he&apos;s getting his ass kicked by his hero. And then the guy from <em>The Notebook</em> shows up and makes it weirder. The whole thing... nobody wins. Nobody won. You know, I had just come from the gymnasium and I was all stretched out and feeling... feeling warmed up. So I&apos;m embarrassed.</blockquote>

<p>Pretty sure Ryan Gosling wins for bringing &quot;gymnasium&quot; back into the lexicon.</p>
