title: The Windowless Room for Rent in Bed-Stuy

<p><img alt="200801nowindow.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130612005851im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200801nowindow.jpg" width="252" height="391" class="right">One Bed-Stuy family is making some money by renting out rooms in their house. Not an uncommon practice, but the lady of the house recently recounted the faces that have passed through the revolving door of their cheapest room for rent: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130612005851/http://bedstuybanana.blogspot.com/2008/01/our-house-windowless-room.html">the windowless bedroom</a>! This gem (pictured) is generally rented out to the early-20s set. Since Craigslist tends to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130612005851/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/17/even_crazy_peop.php">bring out the crazies</a>, let&apos;s take a look at a life of living with some C-list tenants.</p><blockquote>Cathy, an activist novice punk rocker in her early 20&apos;s, believer in the scotch tape method of decorating, consumer of manic panic neon haircolour by the caseload, cook at an activist bookstore/cafe.<p></p>

<p>Rosemary, age 29 with a passion for African dance, cooking and strong perfume. An often unemployed photographer/waitress.</p>

<p>Paul, 29, was a college professor of gender and race studies. Supposedly had many female fans in his classes, so much so they put him on a fan website of teachers, a fact he seemed rather proud of.</p>

<p>Ralph, a red-headed eternally cheerful world traveller in his early thirties, was getting his teaching certificate. He was so clean cut and friendly and happy in the windowless room in the heat of summer that Christopher thought at one point that maybe he was an FBI agent.</p></blockquote>All seemingly respectable roomies, but did you know it is actually illegal to have a bedroom without a window to the exterior? It&apos;s part of the Light and Air regulations in the New York City Building Code (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130612005851/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/downloads/pdf/lh_inspection_standards.pdf">PDF</a>). Given it&apos;s New York and people are happy to put their hard-earned cash towards a space that in any other state would be considered a walk-in closet, this seems to be common practice. As such, the law is likely difficult to regulate, but we wonder if any families like the above have ever been busted for such a thing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130612005851/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/04/lot_line_window.php">We know</a> that Corcoran and Cynthia Rowley were recently sued over a similar issue after selling what was a one-bedroom condo as a three-bedroom condo (two of the rooms only had lot-line windows and the buyers felt duped).<p></p>
