<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060638/http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/2008-festival/events/all-events-by-date">fest runs through Sunday</a> with events spanning the spectrum; from Mathemagicians to panels on the Science of Disney Imagineering to...Alan Alda! In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060638/http://www.236.com/blog/w/alex_leo/inappropriate_questions_for_al_1_6681.php">a recent interview</a>, Hawkeye promises there is fun to be had with &quot;stories about experiments that have gone wrong. Brian Greene talking about Quantum Weirdness might tickle your risibilities, too. (Have you ever had them tickled weirdly and quantumly?)&quot; As for Alda, he&apos;ll be &quot;in a reading of QED, the play about Richard Feynman, who was pretty much the most entertaining physicist who ever lived.&quot;</p>
