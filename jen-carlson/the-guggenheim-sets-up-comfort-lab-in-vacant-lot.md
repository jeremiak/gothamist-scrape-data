</div></div>					<p>In January <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152655/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/guggenheim_to_bring_public_toilets.php">it was announced</a> that the Guggenheim would bring a pop-up piazza, of sorts, to the East Village. The temporary structure would act as a community center, a think tank, and whatever residents wanted it to be (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152655/http://evgrieve.com/2011/05/soon-youll-be-able-to-go-no-1-or-no-2.html">public restrooms</a>?); you can learn more in the video below. Well, today there was a little press preview for the project, which will launch in August, where they delivered more renderings, and more details.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152655if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/GXEU_pJ9vOI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Before going on a six year tour around the world, the raised structure will set up camp for ten weeks on East 1st Street (in a vacant lot) between 1st and 2nd avenues (very close to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152655/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/29/happy_birthday_nexus_of_the_univers.php">the nexus of the universe</a>!). The space will include a cafe, artwork, an open space for discussion, and yes, public restrooms. Director of the Guggenheim, Richard Armstrong, says &quot;the lab shows that we can roll up our sleeves and get involved in the community.&quot;</p>

<p>According to a press release they sent out today, after the first cycle concludes, a special exhibition will take place in New York in 2013, exploring the ideas and solutions that were addressed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152655/http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/collaborations/bmw-guggenheim">at the Lab</a>&#x2019;s different venues. The theme for this cycle will be, &quot;Confronting Comfort, an exploration of how urban environments can be made more responsive to people&#x2019;s needs, how a balance can be found between modern notions of individual versus collective comfort, and the urgent need for environmental and social responsibility.&quot; You can drop in your 2 cents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152655/http://bmwguggenheimlab.org/">right here</a>.</p>
