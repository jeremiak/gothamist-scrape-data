<p>Ridgewood has been transforming over the past few years (in case you missed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006123203/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/07/ridgewood_quooklyn_comments_ny_time.php">those NY Times articles</a>), and the neighborhood&apos;s Seneca Avenue seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006123203/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/22/new_ridgewood_bar.php">destined to become</a> something like Williamsburg&apos;s Bedford Avenue. Later this year, a music venue will open on the stretch of street just off the M train.</p>

<p>Footlight, both a bar and venue, will be run by a team of creators and self-described &quot;movers and shakers&quot; who have come together to create the creative space within the community. &quot;Ridgewood is made up of small businesses and small business owners,&quot; one of the owners, Laura Regan, told us this week, &quot;I&apos;m hoping that by opening a small venue and neighborhood bar, we will successfully integrate into the community and help maintain it&apos;s integrity.&quot; Along with Regan, Gabriel Rodriguez is a co-owner.</p>

<p>The venue will open at 465 Seneca Avenue, which used to be Equinoxio, a bar that shuttered a few years ago. &quot;The building is extremely old and awesome,&quot; Regan says, &quot;We speculate that it was originally a knitting factory from some old paint on the exterior back wall. It became a bar for a time back in the early 2000s but the space has been mainly empty since 2008. The bones of the bar and hall are really gorgeous. Our landlord is a flooring contractor so we really lucked out with some beautiful woodwork.&quot;</p>

<p>They plan to carry snacks, local brews, and a small selection of wine and spirits&#x2014;&quot;and we&apos;ll keep the popcorn maker going all day!&quot; The group is currently working with Community Board 5 &quot;to meet all the concerns of the neighborhood&quot; (this is a pretty residential corner), &quot;and fulfill all the requirements to have a bar at the space.&quot;</p>

<p>They&apos;re currently trying to raise some extra funds, and you can contribute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006123203/http://igg.me/at/give-the-footlight-a-leg-up/x/10730564">via Indiegogo</a>.</p>
