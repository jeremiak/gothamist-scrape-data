Currently the creative young locals who took over the neighborhood are fighting change, which is being brought in with the new luxury condo-dwelling residents. Hipster enemy #1: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073530/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/05/williamsburg_locals_band_together_b.php">Duane Reade</a>, formerly a little store owned by three brothers, currently a chain that&apos;s been acquired by Walgreens. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073530/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/12/new-york-brooklyn-williamsburg-gentrification">The Guardian</a> reports that the drugstore is at the center of the fight for Williamsburg&apos;s soul... a soul that allegedly was carefully crafted by the current locals, all of whom &quot;appear to have beards, piercings, lots of tattoos and belong to at least one band. Most also tend to write a blog and spend all night drinking or involved in art projects.&quot;</p>

<p>One such local, 32-year-old Jennifer Nelson, told them Duane Reade &quot;is not the kind of place that I want to shop. We simply do not need another drugstore here. It is not just an urban issue. It is a capitalism issue.&quot; Another said, &quot;All of a sudden our little, quaint place was being infiltrated by the big brands.&quot; The Guardian wonders if &quot;the hipster apocalypse may be nigh.&quot;</p>

<p>Fear not, kids, surely there is another working class neighborhood you can infiltrate, price the current residents out of, and sip your precious nel drip&#x201D; coffee in <strike>peace</strike> angst. </p>
