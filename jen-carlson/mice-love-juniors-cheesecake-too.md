<p>A tipster wrote us just in time for lunch saying to &quot;Check out the specials now in Downtown Brooklyn.&quot; Don&apos;t mind if we do! However, this was quickly followed by these photos and mention of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155416/http://www.juniorscheesecake.com/">Junior&apos;s</a> new &quot;mouse flavor.&quot; While the source specifies the Dekalb location, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155416/http://tweetphoto.com/onlkadao">the poster</a> of the original photo doesn&apos;t say which Junior&apos;s this little guy was spotted at. However, this recent thread on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502155416/http://www.brooklynian.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=53786">Brooklynian</a> message board points to Brooklyn. We called the cheesecake purveyor and were told &quot;this is the first time we&apos;re hearing about a rodent problem.&quot;</p>
