Duritz collaborated with Stephen Belber on a musical titled <em>Black Sun</em>, which will debut at the Ojai Conference in California this week... but the story is all New York City. It stars Evan Rachel Wood and James Carpinello, and will follow the lives of eight New Yorkers. The description reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Eight New Yorkers&#x2014;some new, some old, some just returning after having given up&#x2014;confront perplexing questions and surprising answers in the wake of a world where the sun has disappeared. At first the Black Sun lasts only 23 seconds, creating havoc and moments of solace. But this upside down world eventually becomes permanent. Everything turns into something totally strange and revelatory.&quot;</blockquote>
