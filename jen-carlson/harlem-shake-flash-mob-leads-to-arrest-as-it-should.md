<p>The &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111746/http://gothamist.com/tags/harlemshake">Harlem Shake</a>&quot; meme has been unavoidable and unstoppable, threatening to grow more until its slaughtered us all with its viral powers. But finally the long arm of the law has interfered. The below video shows hundreds of students at Forest Hills High School cramming into the lobby to film their own &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; video, but the disorganized, chaotic scene turned into more of a &quot;riot,&quot; according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111746/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfbfBIiejY">video&apos;s uploader</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111746/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130221/forest-hills/harlem-shake-craze-gets-forest-hills-high-school-student-arrested#ixzz2LXzzAqtl">DNAInfo</a>, the incident took place last Friday around 9:30 a.m., and the alleged organizer&#x2014;17-year-old Arnis Mehmetaj&#x2014;was not only suspended for a week, but he was taken in to the 112th Precinct, given a desk appearance ticket, and charged with disorderly conduct. </p>

<p>Later that day this message went up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111746/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Harlem-SHAKE/189373071186316?ref=stream">a Facebook page</a>: &quot;ARNIS IS FREE THANK YOU FOR SHOWING YOUR SUPPORT. next time someone tells you to stop then stop don&apos;t get another person arrested cause u felt like doing something ... what happen[ed] to him was fucked up ... he tried his best to stop it but got arrested in the end.&quot;</p>

<p>One student perfectly articulated what historians will no doubt cover at length in their authoritative account: &quot;It was supposed to be a harmless thing. It was supposed to be 30 seconds of fun. <strong>I think this Friday was the worst Friday the school ever experienced</strong>.&quot; Mark the date, everyone. February 15th, 2013: The Day Fun Died At Forest Hills High School. </p>
