                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpF25ryPAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140202020948im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpF25ryPAM.jpg" width="261" height="192" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140202020948/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/10/snowball.php">Earlier this year</a> four Bronx teenagers hit off-duty officer Adonis Ramirez with a snowball, and quickly found themselves on the wrong side of a gun barrel. They were charged with weapons possession, attempted assault, menacing and harassment, but then earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140202020948/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/charges_dropped_against_snowball_fo.php">this month</a> the Bronx DA dropped those charges due to &quot;insufficient evidence.&quot; Now some surveillance video of the incident has been released, which may help the Snowball 4, as they&apos;re called, win their $10MM lawsuit against the city.</p>

<p>Officer Ramirez&apos;s claim was that he was hit on the back by multiple snowballs, chased down the street and taunted before drawing his gun, but the new video (below) doesn&apos;t seem to show any of that. It <em>does</em> seem to show him drawing his gun just seconds after getting hit by a snowball&#x2014;which may have been an accident. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140202020948/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/20/2010-05-20_vid_gun_after_1st_snowball.html">the Daily News</a>, the teens also claim he never identified himself as an officer, and 18-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140202020948/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7451572">Minuel Rondon told ABC News</a>, &quot;I felt that at that moment one of us was going to get killed or shot.&quot;</p>

<p>Their lawyer says, &quot;He&apos;s creating a dangerous situation by taking out his weapon. It&apos;s definitely an abuse of power and authority.&quot;</p>
