<p>Is Rockaway next? The question was raised <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161013184734/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/18/could_a_hurrica_1.php">a few years ago</a>, when many speculated that if another hurricane were to hit, like the one that took out Hog Island, then the damages <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161013184734/http://www.nypress.com/article-11820-the-big-one.html">would be enormous</a>. In that same article, the 1893 hurricane and Hog Island story is told... which is really rather terrifyingly amazing. Read about how the hurricane put Canal Street underwater and tore trees up in Central Park, after the jump.</p>
