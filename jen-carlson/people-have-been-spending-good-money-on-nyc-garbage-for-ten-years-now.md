(He talks about this around the 8:30 mark in the video below.) He picked up authentic trash from the &quot;fertile&quot; streets of New York City, encased it, and signed and numbered each little package&#x2014;all &#x201C;limited editions.&quot; The cubes are still selling 10 years later.</p>

<p>The trash includes everything from Pinkberry containers to broken Coca Cola bottles to Mets tickets. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309040404/http://laughingsquid.com/nyc-garbage-trashy-art-in-a-cube-from-new-york-city/">Laughing Squid</a>, Gignac has even tracked where each package of trash has been sent, and &quot;since he began, over 1300 cubes stuffed with trash have been sold to fans in over 30 countries.&quot; </p>

<p>Interestingly, many of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309040404/http://www.nycgarbage.com/order.html">$50+</a> cubes have been sold <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309040404/http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211068714471934238831.000474303647ec4962c3f&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=40.695217,-73.836365&amp;spn=1.416041,3.933105">to New Yorkers</a>, who have access to authentic city garbage 24/7!</p>
