<p>If you haven&apos;t fully embraced the scent of the New York City subway system, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618021329/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/what_is_a_real_new_yorker.php">you&apos;re not a real New Yorker</a>. But if your delicate olfactory system is offended by the smells that have developed on the platforms over the years, then this art student has something for you.</p>

<p>SVA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618021329/https://vimeo.com/154349230">Angela Kim</a> has created a scratch n&apos; sniff sign and placed it in various locations underground, telling passersby: &quot;If you smell something, smell something else.&quot; (A clever nod to the MTA&apos;s &quot;If you see something, say something&quot; warning.) The scents can be pulled off like tabs on a Dan Smith flyer, and provide scents like vanilla, lavender, orchid, magnolia and tuberose.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618021329/http://untappedcities.com/2016/02/08/guerrilla-scratch-sniff-stickers-in-nyc-subway-for-a-better-smelling-ride/">Untapped Cities</a>, she&apos;ll be posting them all over throughout the month, and they&apos;ve already been placed in Canal Street, Union Square, and Herald Square stations.</p>
