<p>Truth: this is the kind of random act of fun we really love. Copywriter Chelsea Davison recently started a massive game of Truth or Dare in Washington Square Park, where New Yorkers stumbled upon typed out &quot;truths&quot; and &quot;dares&quot; and performed them in front of friends and strangers. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152548/http://cargocollective.com/chelseadavison/Truth-or-Dare">her site</a>, she did this because &quot;New Yorkers are pretty closed off. It&apos;s hard to make eye contact, let alone introduce yourself to someone new. So to make New York a little more friendly I took the middle school approach and organized a massive game of truth or dare.&quot; </p>

<p>All in all she left 300 cards around the park, along with a note to Tweet the &quot;truths&quot; at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152548/https://twitter.com/#!/TruthOrDareNYC">the Twitter account</a> she set up. This all went down on June 9th... and yes, there&apos;s video:</p>
