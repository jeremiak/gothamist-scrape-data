Click through for a look at beer crates stacked higher than the eye can see, a massive line of men waiting on line for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073652/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/18/new_york_citys_first_liquor_license.php">a liquor license</a>, and the New York Times front page from December 6th, 1933, declaring that &quot;New York Celebrates With Quiet Restraint.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course, if you want to relive the prohibition era, you can always head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073652/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/18/inside_21_1.php">21 Club</a> and ask for a tour of their old wine cellar, which is still hidden behind a secret door in the kitchen.</p>
