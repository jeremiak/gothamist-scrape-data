<p>The broken hearted balloon that Banksy placed on a Red Hook wall in early October has seen a lot of action since it debuted: it was tagged, covered with plexiglass, covered with a gate, guarded, and then ripped out from the building and flown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171822/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/banksys_heart_balloon_to_be_sold_in.php">to Miami</a>, where it now sits. What was meant for the public, has been placed behind <em>velvet ropes</em> at Art Miami, one of the satellite art fairs that happens during Art Basel. Here it is on display today:</p>

<p>Somewhere, Banksy&apos;s WikiLeaks car is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171822/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/nyc_art_gallery_owner_selling_banks.php">also on display</a> and ready to hit the auction block down there. The man behind robbing New York of the pieces is gallery owner Stephan Keszler, and this isn&apos;t his first time working with building owners to procure Banksy pieces for profit. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171822/http://www.pestcontroloffice.com/whatispco.html">Pest Control</a>, who works with Banksy, has previously &#x201C;warned Mr. Keszler about the serious implications of selling unauthenticated works,&quot; and they won&apos;t authenticate the works, &quot;claiming that the artist wants these stencil paintings to remain in their original context.&quot; Though as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171822/http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/corbett/keszler-banksy-10-12-11.asp">ArtNet</a> pointed out, &quot;Authenticating his Street Art, Banksy said in an interview, would be like &apos;a signed confession on letterhead.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Either way, Keszler will probably walk away with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171822/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/nyc_art_gallery_owner_selling_banks.php">a million bucks</a>.</p>
