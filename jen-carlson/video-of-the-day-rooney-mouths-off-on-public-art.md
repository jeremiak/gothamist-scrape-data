---

<p>Ever wonder what Andy Rooney has to say about all the public art displayed in the city? Well, here he is mouthing off on what he calls &quot;pretentious nonsense,&quot; amongst other things.</p>

<p>Here in New York he addresses the defeat of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113944/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/12/serra_in_greenp.php">Richard Serra&apos;s &quot;Tilted Arc&quot;</a> by saying: &quot;Take that arty arc!&quot; (Burn?) He then goes on to question why every open space needs to be filled in when &quot;nothing&quot; would look better.
