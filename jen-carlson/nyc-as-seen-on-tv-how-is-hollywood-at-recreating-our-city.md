<p>Don&apos;t you love when you are watching a movie and your OCD about NYC pal points out that tiny little inaccuracy in, say, the subway car. Hollywood doesn&apos;t always get the city&apos;s details down to perfection, and sometimes their portrayal is downright <em>insulting</em>. We&apos;re launching a new series to out the worst of the worst&#x2014;so if you see something off on the big or small screen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510230950/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">say something</a>. </p>

Send along your own tips and screenshots, and we&apos;ll do our best to document Hollywood&apos;s mistakes!</p>
