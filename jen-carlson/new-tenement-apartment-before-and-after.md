title: New Tenement Apartment: Before and After
---

<p>Tonight is the housewarming party, so to speak, for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105253/http://www.tenement.org/tours.html#moore">the Tenement Museum&apos;s new apartment</a> and the opening of its first tour since 2002. This one is titled, The Moores: An Irish Family in America. They tell us that &quot;it&#x2019;s taken about 6 years from concept to completion for this particular project. That includes research, planning, fundraising, designing, bringing the upper floors up to code, purchasing artifacts for the apartment, developing content.&quot;</p>

<p>Like their other apartments, this one tells the story of a family who actually lived at 97 Orchard Street. The Moore family (Bridget, Joseph, and their three young daughters) resided there in 1869, and were one of only a few Irish families living in a predominantly German neighborhood.</p><blockquote>The Moores faced a shattering health crisis: the loss of their daughter Agnes to a malnutrition-related disease. Building on the Moores&#x2019; experience, the tour discusses the changing attitudes towards medicine and public health care in the 19th and early 20th centuries, relating how our city has become a healthier place and how immigrants today work to keep their families healthy.</blockquote>This is the museum&#x2019;s sixth restored apartment and its fourth public building tour; take a look as some before and after pictures of the renovation below (more at the museum&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105253/http://www.flickr.com/photos/tenement">Flickr page</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105253/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/nyregion/17tenement.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> notes that &quot;None of the original furnishings have survived. In fact, when museum researchers contacted a few descendants of one of the Moores&#x2019; daughters, Jane, they learned that the family did not even know their ancestors had ever lived at 97 Orchard Street.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Tours begin today (and run Tues-Fri at 12, 1:30, 3, &amp; 4:30, Weekends at 11, 12:30, 2, 3:30, &amp; 5). Learn more about the Moore family after their jump.</p><div class="galleryEase" id="gallery-0">
