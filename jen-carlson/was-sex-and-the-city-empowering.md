<p>This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607215755/http://gothamist.com/tags/sexandthecity"><em>Sex and the City</em></a> turned 19 years old, and while we still don&apos;t know how Carrie Bradshaw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607215755/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/do_over_carrie_bradshaw_math.php">could afford her lifestyle or apartment</a> in Manhattan on a freelance writer&apos;s salary, one question has been answered by the woman herself. Was the show empowering? Nope.  </p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607215755/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/sarah-jessica-parker-sex-and-the-city-1202455883/">an interview with Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, Sarah Jessica Parker says the series was not about empowerment, it was about love. </p>

Parker explained:</p><blockquote>&quot;I don&#x2019;t think that empowerment was a word that was ever used once on our set, in a writers room, among the female actors. That kind of intimate relationship among female friends was brand new. A female character who spoke so candidly about sex and sexual politics and her curiosity about behavior... Because she was a writer, she could ask lots of provocative questions and observe, and the other characters could, as they were archetypes, sort of make choices. It wasn&#x2019;t intentionally empowering, I guess is my point. The show was really about love, it wasn&apos;t about empowerment. It was always a journey about finding home. Where is that? What does contentment mean? How do they find love? It was a time and a place, economically and politically that allowed us to tell stories in that way. In retrospect people talk about it being empowering, but if you tried to write a show that was empowering it would have been yucky and self-conscious, and it would have been contrived and stiff.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607215755/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women">Emily Nussbaum&apos;s 2013 look back</a> on the show, she wrote: &quot;For a half dozen episodes, Carrie was a happy, curious explorer, out companionably smoking with modellizers. If she&#x2019;d stayed that way, the show might have been another <em>Mary Tyler Moore</em>: a playful, empowering comedy about one woman&#x2019;s adventures in the big city. Instead, Carrie fell under the thrall of Mr. Big... From then on, pleasurable as <em>Sex and the City</em> remained, it also felt designed to push back at its audience&#x2019;s wish for identification, triggering as much anxiety as relief.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course, the audience can still find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607215755/https://www.bustle.com/articles/106952-7-sex-and-the-city-lessons-about-feminine-empowerment-fashion">empowering moments</a> in the show&#x2014;SJP&apos;s not the boss of you. (Though we would totally take a job working for her if she offered!)</p>
