										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="batcat0611darkkngiht.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161427im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/batcat0611darkkngiht.jpg" width="350" height="243" class="image-right"> </span><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> has started filming, with planned shoots in India, London, Pittsburgh, and New York City (it will be filming under the names <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161427/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/the_dark_knight_rises.php"><em>Magnus Rex</em> and <em>Fox Hills Green</em></a>, so stay alert for signs).

<p>This will be the final installation in Christopher Nolan&apos;s trilogy, but don&apos;t worry, the franchise will be rebooted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161427/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/batman_destined_to_return_again_and.php">forever and ever and always</a>.</p>
