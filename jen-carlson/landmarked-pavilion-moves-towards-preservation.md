The winter weather dislodged and even cracked panels after a decision not to protect it was made.</p>

<p>This year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140328075805/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/11/06/2009-11-06_pavilion_paint_job_okd_marble_map_gets_protection.html?r=ny_local">the Daily News</a> reports that &quot;volunteers began clearing debris and weeds in recent weeks from the 9,000-square-foot curiosity, prepping to enact a preservation plan first devised in 2008.&quot; The plan is to bury it from the elements beneath sand and gravel. Pro bono architects are also working on &quot;short-term reuses for the concrete-and-steel behemoth, while a pair of World&apos;s Fair fans have started repainting the exterior of its striped promenade base.&quot; The World&apos;s Fair Association, however, wants this latter fix put on pause until preservationists determine the original paint scheme.</p>

<p>The New York State Pavilion was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140328075805/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/16/landmarks.php">landmarked in September</a>, but will it ever get the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140328075805/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/11/pity_the_new_yo.php">rehab</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140328075805/http://gothamist.com/2004/07/08/what_to_do_with_the_1964_worlds_fair_towers_in_queens.php">re-purposing</a> that&apos;s been talked about for years.</p>
