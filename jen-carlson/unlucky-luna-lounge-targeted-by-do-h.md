Ice is considered food in the health dept&apos;s eyes, I kid you not.&quot;</p>

<p>Their problem was rooted in some nit-picky neighbor noise complaints, and it seems like the same thing is happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025929/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/studio_b_1.php">to Studio B</a>. Reportedly, Luna Lounge was &quot;cited for operating without a permit on 3/7 and were given time to renew. They will not be allowed to reopen until they pay their fine, get their permit, and pass their reopening inspection.&quot; </p>

<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025929/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/05/the_music_stall.php">Music Hall of Williamsburg</a> thriving in the old North Six space, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025929/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/galapagos_moves.php">Galapagos</a> space getting taken over by Southpaw owner Matt Roff, some wonder if Luna&apos;s 300+ capacity space will be able to survive with or without the latest DoH problems. A request for a comment from owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727025929/http://gothamist.com/2004/08/10/rob_sacher_coowner_luna_lounge.php">Rob Sacher</a> wasn&apos;t immediately returned.</p>
