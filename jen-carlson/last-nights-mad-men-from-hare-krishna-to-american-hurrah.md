title: Last Night's Mad Men: From Hare Krishna To American Hurrah
---

	
										<p>It&apos;s time to look back at the timestamps placed in last night&apos;s episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>&#x2014;there were quite a few. Don&apos;t scroll down unless you&apos;re prepared for some spoilers.</p>

<p><strong>HARE KRISHNA</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="MADMENhare.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/MADMENhare.jpg" width="640" height="372" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Harry goes to visit former ad man Paul Kinsey, who has joined the Hare Krishnas. This movement actually started in New York in 1966 (the current year on <em>Mad Men</em>) as a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organization, founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The movement&apos;s beliefs are based on traditional Hindu scriptures like the Bhagavad Gita. </p>

<p>In October of 1966, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00B10FD3F58117B93C2A8178BD95F428685F9">the NY Times</a> reported on the movement, specifically a meeting in Tompkins Square Park that Allen Ginsberg attended. He told them, &quot;It brings a state of ecstacy. For one thing, the syllables force yoga breath control; that&apos;s one physiological explanation.&quot; He was talking about the mantra (&quot;Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama, Rama, Hare Hare&quot;), which he also said &quot;replaced LSD and other drugs for many of the swami&apos;s followers.&quot;</p>

<p>When Harry visits Kinsey at the Krishna storefront, this was most likely at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26+2nd+ave+ny&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.724551,-73.990602&amp;spn=0.006001,0.013239&amp;sll=40.724505,-73.990401&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,134.71,,0,3.68&amp;cbll=40.724471,-73.990662&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=26+2nd+Ave,+New+York,+10003&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=i7jxcf1dHdWkNSjFTEcnMg">26 2nd Avenue</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX1pJ0DLaG0">it&apos;s still used today</a>.</p>

<p><strong>AMERICAN HURRAH</strong><br>

Megan takes Don to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059/http://www.vanitallie.com/plays/hurrah.html"><em>America Hurrah</em></a>, which premiered at the Pocket Theatre on November 7th, 1966. The trilogy of short plays&#x2014;called Interview, TV, and Motel&#x2014;first premiered at LaMama Experimental Theatre Club in 1964. In New York it ran for 640 performances and was &quot;widely hailed as the watershed play of the sixties&#x2014;the first major dramatic expression of the anti-Viet Nam war movement. Catching theatre&#x2014;goers by surprise, <em>America Hurrah</em> had a shock effect on the culture.&quot; Don wasn&apos;t a fan however, as he viewed it as a criticism of his career in advertising. </p>

<p><strong>STAR TREK</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="startrek0512.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/startrek0512.jpg" width="640" height="356" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The original Star Trek series started running on television in 1966, and had only been on air for a few months at this time. Kinsey writes a spec script and tries to get Harry to get in the hands of someone at NBC. It&apos;s called &quot;The Negron Complex,&quot; and someone points out on a Trekkie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059/http://www.trekbbs.com/showthread.php?p=6371659">message board</a>, &quot;I laughed because the &apos;Negron&apos; people were white, so they&apos;re playfully poking at the mythical Star Trek script about the world with the inverse race problem.&quot; Here&apos;s a promo for the show in 1966:</p>

<p><strong>CHRISTMAS WALTZ</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="madmenbar0512.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/madmenbar0512.jpg" width="640" height="464" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The song Joan and Don are listening to at the bar is &quot;Christmas Waltz&quot; which has been performed by many, including Peggy Lee (who just sang to JFK at Madison Square Garden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235059/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/never_before_published_photos_of_ma.php#photo-8">on his birthday</a> a few years earlier). This was also the title of the episode, and some the song&apos;s more prominent lyrics are: &quot;May your New Years dreams come true.&quot; There are only three episodes of the show left for the season, and this one saw the characters seemingly starting down new paths, both good and bad: Don is <em>back</em>, and is throwing himself back into the game at the agency; Joan is moving forward with her divorce; Kinsey is (possibly) moving to L.A.&#x2014;but on the other hand, Lane is amidst a financial mess; Roger is now getting drunk before 8 a.m. (albeit, he&apos;s a former sailor and in this episode was commemorating the 25th anniversary of Pearl Harbor); and Harry may soon have a Hare Krishna recruiter hunting him down.</p>
