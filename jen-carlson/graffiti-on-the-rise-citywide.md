<p>New stats from the NYPD show an 81.5% <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229184811/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04212008/news/regionalnews/urban_scrawl_is_spreading_in_city_107387.htm">rise in graffiti-related complaints</a> from 2006 to 2007 (pre-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229184811/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/22/breaking_allege.php">Splasher</a>!), a year that graffiti arrests also went up 28%. </p>

<p>Queens council member Peter Vallone, Jr. notes that, &quot;we did an excellent job turning the tide against graffiti in the &apos;90s and the beginning part of this century. Unfortunately, because of the lack of police officers, the fact that they have to do double duty and combat serious threats like terrorism, minor crime, including graffiti, are on the rise.&quot; As such, Vallone has turned the graffiti problem into his own personal battle, along with his attempt at trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229184811/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/03/vallone_says_no.php">pass a law</a> against daredevils climbing buildings (something that happens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229184811/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/04/yesterday_we_no.php">once in a blue moon</a>). </p>

<p>Vallone blames evil pop culture for the insurgence, however the NYPD notes that the numbers could just be a result of &quot;better reporting and police work&quot;; in 2007 police began logging 311 and 911 graffiti complaints and documenting the identities of taggers.
