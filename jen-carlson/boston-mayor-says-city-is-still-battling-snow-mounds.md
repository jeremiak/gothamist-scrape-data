---

	
										<p>As we bask in the sun and allow its rays to replenish our Vitamin D, let&apos;s look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904080331/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/20/wicked_boreal_up_there.php">to Boston</a>. Up there, Mayor Marty Walsh has declared the city is still surrounded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904080331/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/09/report_snow_melting.php">snow mounds</a>. At least, one snow mound. At least, <em>we think it&apos;s a snow mound</em>. He tweeted this photo earlier today, noting that &quot;snow is still melting&quot; there. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Be sure to enjoy today&apos;s hot weather, because snow is still melting away at the Tide Street Snow Farm. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904080331/http://t.co/i2wH94XVKD">pic.twitter.com/i2wH94XVKD</a></p>&#x2014; Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904080331/https://twitter.com/marty_walsh/status/603648324080656384">May 27, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>Can you continue calling something a snow mound after it has thrived in the spring air, amassed power through consuming garbage, grown functioning organs, tapped into the city&apos;s infrastructure, absorbed the Curse of the Bambino, and developed a plot to take over Southie?</p>

<p>Anyway, nothing a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904080331/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/27/weather_happening.php">unseasonal hail storm</a> won&apos;t... make worse.</p>
