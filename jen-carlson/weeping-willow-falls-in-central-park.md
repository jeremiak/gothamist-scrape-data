<p>Oh no! Reader Marc Bloomgarden sent us the above picture, saying, &quot;this iconic Weeping willow has fallen in to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124232/http://www.centralpark2000.com/database/pool.html">the Pool</a> in Central Park.&quot; It survived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124232/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/central_parks_post-storm_damage_hea.php">the August storm</a> that took down so many trees in the Park, so we reached out to the Central Park Conservancy to find out what felled this willow. We&apos;ll update when we hear back from them.</p>
