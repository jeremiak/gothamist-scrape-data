</div></div>					<p>Last night on <em>Mad Men</em>, Harry Crane and Don Draper headed to Queens to catch The Rolling Stones at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in an effort to sign them up to record a jingle for Heinz Beans (move over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060334/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/26/1966_ads.php">Bean Ballet</a>), with a &quot;<strike>Time</strike>Heinz Is On Your Side&quot; pitch*. The two even explore the borough a little, with a stop at the Queens Boulevard White Castle! We won&apos;t include any real spoilers here&#x2014;instead, let&apos;s look back at the stadium and the concert. When we check out some photos from 1966, the year that Don Draper &amp; Co. are currently living in, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060334/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/21/photos_from_1966_nyc_aka_season_5_m.php#photo-4">saw a photo</a> of this Rolling Stones concert, which happened <em>in real life</em> on July 2nd, 1966. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="draperbackstage.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060334im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/draperbackstage.jpeg" width="640" height="400" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The stadium had a capacity of 14,000, and saw acts like The Beatles, The Supremes, Joan Baez, Jimi Hendrix, Judy Garland, Neil Diamond, and Frank Sinatra; you can even spot it in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s <em>Strangers On A Train</em>. Even with all of that history, and the fact that it was the venue for the U.S. Open for many years, it was still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060334/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/net-post/2011/aug/29/ruin-forest/">denied landmark status</a> last year. Here&apos;s some video of the state of things at the stadium now:</p>

<p>Bonus fact: This stadium is also where Richie Tenenbaum played the worst tennis of his life:</p>

<p>*As Don noted in last night&apos;s episode, The Rolling Stones <em>had</em> sold out already:</p>
