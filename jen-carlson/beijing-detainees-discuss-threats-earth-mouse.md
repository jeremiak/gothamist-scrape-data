<p>With the Beijing detainees now out of reach of the Chinese government, they&apos;re doing some talking. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045647/http://animalnewyork.com/news/2008/08/chinese-interrogators-to-activ.php">Animal</a> spoke with New Yorker Jeffrey Goldin last night, one of the ten American activists released earlier this week. Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045647/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/19/grl_founder_detained_in_beijing.php">James Powderly</a>, Goldin was also taken in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045647/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/25/grl_founder_james_powderly_back_at.php"><em>V for Vendetta</em>-style</a>, but he goes further into the details about the 2 a.m. wake up call, saying the eight secret police were asking a lot of questions about &#x201C;Earth Mouse.&quot;</p><blockquote>Goldin had met with Powderly and the others earlier in the day in Beijing to discuss the high tech L.A.S.E.R. protest, but eventually trouble came. &quot;That&apos;s the night they picked us up.&quot; After being taken to a basement of a hotel and interrogated one by one in conference rooms, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045647/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/21/the_beijing_6_being_held_for_10_day.php">the six</a> were then put in vans and told they were going to be deported. However, the mini-caravan drove past the airport and continued on, straight to a prison.<p></p>

<p><strong>&quot;There was a metal chair with a metal belt that they actually strapped you down to.&quot; One of the most pressing questions the interrogators repeatedly asked them was &quot;who is Earth Mouse?&quot;</strong></p></blockquote>While he denied knowing anything about this Earth Mouse character (during the 6-10 hour interrogations a day), Goldin says he was the guy that wasn&apos;t in China, <strong>&quot;helping coordinate and organize the Students for A Free Tibet&apos;s actions via Twitter.&quot;</strong>In the end, they were released early and receieved all of their personal belongings back (you know, besides their cash and digital cameras), and their credit cards were charged $2,000 each--all in all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045647/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/new-yorkers-claim-mistreatment-at-hands-of-chinese/84590/">NY Sun</a> reports about $20,000 stolen from the group. Powderly also told the paper, <strong>&quot;They threatened our lives, threatened the lives of people we know, of our family members, and they told us that they could get us, even outside of China.&quot;</strong> At LAX they were greeted by embraces from 4 monks, and 40 women dressed in traditional Tibetan garb.<p></p>
