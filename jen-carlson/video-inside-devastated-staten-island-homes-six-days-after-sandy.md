<p>Six days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141118034046/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> left, Brooklyn filmmaker John Kersten visited Staten Island, one of the hardest hit areas in NYC. In the below video he meets a few New Dorp Beach residents, whose homes were almost fully submerged at the height of the storm&#x2014;one man tells him, &quot;people are just walking around in a daze, not believing it happened. Everything I had... everything&apos;s gone. A lifetime of memories.&quot;</p>
