										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:325px; "> <img alt="applescreen0711SM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144503im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/applescreen0711SM.jpg" width="325" height="244"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">A &quot;participant&quot; in McDonald&apos;s project.</span></i></div> Over the course of three days in June, artist Kyle McDonald captured the faces of Apple patrons in two of the company&apos;s Manhattan stores. He did this by installing a program on computers in the stores, which automatically took an image every minute. He explained, &#x201C;I thought maybe we could see ourselves doing this we would think more about our computers and how we&#x2019;re using them.&quot; Well, now he won&apos;t have to think about it, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144503/http://mashable.com/2011/07/07/secret-service-apple-store-art-2/">Mashable</a> is reporting that the U.S. Secret Service has confiscated McDonald&apos;s own personal computers!<p></p>

<p>The site notes that McDonald knew an Apple technician had traced traffic from almost 100 of their computers to his own servers, but he figured it wasn&apos;t a big deal... until the four men in suits came knocking on his door this morning with a search warrant for computer fraud. They left with two computers, an iPod, flash drives, and a message: Apple will be contacting you. But for now he&apos;s just hoping they&apos;ll let him back into the store so he can buy a new computer. </p>

<p>McDonald doesn&apos;t believe he broke any laws, however, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144503/http://peoplestaringatcomputers.tumblr.com/">his website</a> is still up, showing photos of people gazing into the glowing computer screens.</p>
