<p>At some time between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m., the band&apos;s gear trailer was stolen from outside a house in SE Portland, near the Aladdin Theatre. Heartbreakingly, it housed practically every piece of instrumentation belonging to the Decemberists. </p>

<p>So this is a sort of call to arms; I figure if we get the word out, maybe we all can collectively track it down. </p>

<p>The trailer in question is a WHITE 6&apos; x 12&apos; WELLS CARGO trailer. There&apos;s a green &apos;VT&apos; (as in Vermont) sticker on the side door, among other smaller stickers, a BRITISH FLAG sticker on the front, and a &apos;NO ON 36&apos; sticker on the left back door. The license number is U34 8717 (Oregon). </p>

<p>Any information you might have on this, please report to the Portland Police. If you do see it, by all means call 911. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>You can now donate to the fund to help the band get new gear by sending a check to them at: </p>

<p>Please help Colin and gang, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225053410/http://www.decemberists.com/Gear_Manifest.pdf">missing gear list (PDF)</a> is long and we want them to be able to play all of their shows, especially the ones in New York in May. The clock is ticking!</p>
