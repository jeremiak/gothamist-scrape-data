<p><em>Someone</em> is taking passive-aggressive note-writing to a whole new level. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230185009/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=34994">Miss Heather</a> spotted this giant cardboard sign on Kent Avenue and North 1st Street in Williamsburg recently. The note reads: &quot;Dear Medieval Slum Neighbors or Transients, Please buy trash cans. Take it off your rent, or call your parents or servant to clean this up. I hope you are at least using your indoor plumbing. Yours, Your Appalled Neighbor.&quot; Sigh, and now they have to recycle that massive piece of cardboard, too?</p>
