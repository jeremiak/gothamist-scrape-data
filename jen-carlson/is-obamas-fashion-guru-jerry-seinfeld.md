title: Is Obama's Fashion Guru Jerry Seinfeld?

<p><img alt="obamaseinfeld.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011643im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/obamaseinfeld.jpg" width="350" height="341" class="right">Don&apos;t go thinking all the fashion talk about the Obamas is geared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011643/http://www.mrs-o.org/">towards Michelle</a>, Barack has also been getting his fair share of critique since before he even won the election--Tim Gunn approved his style <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011643/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/10/baracks_bike_fashion_works_for_tim.php">back in June</a>.</p>

<p>Now that he&apos;s done campaigning, and has ditched the dark suits, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011643/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/fashion/13ROW.html?ref=style">The NY Times</a> is taking a look at his casual side. Belted jeans, sneakers, tucked-in polo shirts...sounds a little like he raided Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s closet, no? (<em>Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that.</em>) </p>

<p>The paper asked the comedian how it felt to have the President-elect copping his style, and he told them: &#x201C;<strong>I don&#x2019;t know that I can make a proprietary claim to that look. [But] I&#x2019;m happy to have the association.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>No need to panic until we see the leader of the free world in a pirate shirt, right?</p>
