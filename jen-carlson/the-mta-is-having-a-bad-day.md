<p>Just as foretold by Nostradamus, the New York City Subway Apocalypse of 2016 A.D. is upon us. Currently (7:30 p.m. on April 5th) the A, C, E, B, D, F, M, G, L, N, R, and Q trains are seeing delays of some sort&#x2014;some people are reporting up to 45 minute wait times. Signal problems, rail conditions, and the earlier incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014094356/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/05/l_train_struck_williamsburg.php">on the L train tracks</a> are chief amongst the causes. We&apos;ve reached out to the MTA for clarification on these delays, which seem to be worse than normal. Until we hear back, step inside the mind of this evening&apos;s commuter, call your parents and tell them you love them, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014094356/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us</a> photos of the soul-crushing scene if you should be in the midst of it.</p>
