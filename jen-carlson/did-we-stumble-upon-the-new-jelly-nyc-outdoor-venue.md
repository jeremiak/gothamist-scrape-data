</div></div><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602063338/http://jellynyc.com/">JellyNYC</a>&#x2014;perhaps fed up with the politics and their &quot;fake non-profit&quot; overlords hassling them at their home-away-from pool, AKA the East River Park Police State&#x2014;are on the cusp of announcing a new summer concert series. (Yes, the Big Show will still go on at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602063338/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/02/pool_parties_announced.php">state park</a>.) There aren&apos;t a lot of details yet, but it sounds like they&apos;re trying to get back to their roots of laid-back semi-DIY free shows. </p>

<p>We were told that the series will occur on &quot;six Saturdays over the next three months at a brand new outdoor venue in Williamsburg that will include the long-awaited return of the Slip n&apos; Slide!&quot; All shows will be free, beers will be cheap (Six Point is a sponsor), and lineups will be announced next week. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve double confirmed with JellyNYC that this is all happening, so the question is <em>where</em>? They aren&apos;t saying yet, but we&apos;re going with the big old parking lot next to Giando on the Waterfront <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602063338/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=412+Kent+Avenue,+Brooklyn,+NY%E2%80%8E&amp;sll=40.71163,-73.969274&amp;sspn=0.008328,0.017295&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=412+Kent+Ave,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11211&amp;ll=40.710573,-73.968501&amp;spn=0.008328,0.017295&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.710488,-73.968493&amp;panoid=1F4okPzNkmyiTUSInXTY5Q&amp;cbp=12,241.54,,0,5.53">on Kent Avenue</a> in Williamsburg (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602063338/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/30/bike_lane_sagas_phony_detour_sign_o.php">former home of the unauthorized detour</a> sign from the bike lane wars.). In the past couple of weeks, workers have been busy completely repaving it, putting up a new fence, and have even laid the foundation for what <em>could</em> be a stage right there on the water. So as long as Giando isn&apos;t hosting any outdoor weddings on these Saturdays, then all the organizers have to worry about is the inevitable clashing of the Hasidic community (on Shabbos!) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602063338/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/12/hasids_say_cyclists_too_sexy_for_bi.php">sexy concert-goers</a> (bonus points if they&apos;re on a bike).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> JellyNYC tells us this is NOT the spot, but that the venue <em>is</em> in South Williamsburg. They also told us it&apos;s not on the water, and that they &quot;wish [this] was the spot.&quot; Doesn&apos;t sound promising... any guesses? Under the BQE?</p>
