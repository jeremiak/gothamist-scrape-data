<p>The nostalgia trains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231754/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/06/nostalgia_trains_and_buses_are_here.php#photo-1">are back for the holidays</a>, and with them are some vintage ads, including this one which instructs straphangers on how to handle commuters with poor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231754/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a>. Specifically: the door blocker.</p>

<p>According to an old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231754/http://subwayartblog.com/2009/12/29/retro-ads-from-the-nostalgia-train/">Subway Art Blog</a> post, &quot;The Subway Sun was a series of public service ads that ran from the 1940s to the 1960s. Frederick G. Cooper was the original cartoonist behind the series, and in 1946 his prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;e Amelia Opdyke Jones or &apos;Oppy&apos; took over and continued to design them for the next 20 years. The term &apos;litterbug&apos; is said to have originated from Oppy&#x2019;s posters.&quot;</p>

<p>When the posters were on exhibit at the Transit Museum in the 1990s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231754/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/nyregion/playing-neighborhood-brooklyn-heights-promoting-subway-manners-days-before.html">the NY Times</a> noted that another of Oppy&apos;s works was: &apos;&apos;Quarantine the Gumbug,&apos;&apos; from 1948, while others read: &quot;Suppose you were old?,&quot; &quot;Politeness promotes popularity,&quot; &quot;We can&apos;t print words that fit people who spit,&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;litterbug&quot; sign, amongst others.</p>

<p>Maybe it&apos;s time to bring these back&#x2014;though now we&apos;ve added some new ways to offend our fellow straphangers, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231754/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/two_young_ladies_filmed_giving_thei.php">unspeakable acts of poor subway etiquette</a>.
