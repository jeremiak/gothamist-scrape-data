He told us that &quot;as a graffiti writer all I can think to do is go sneak out at night and get busted.&quot; This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213349/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/25/grl_founder_james_powderly_back_at.php">he was released</a> early and sent back to the U.S. with others he was being held with, and he told us about why he did what he did, his experience in Chinese prison, and what landed him there.</em></p>

<p><strong>We heard about a &apos;how-to&apos; project you were working on...</strong> I&apos;m making a construction set that&apos;s called How to Get Thrown into Chinese Prison. It&apos;s actually really easy to do if you&apos;re Tibetan and protest your repression or occupancy by the Chinese government, or if you&apos;re a Chinese national and you talk about democracy, if you&apos;re an old woman and you want to be a Christian...it&apos;s pretty simple. But if you&apos;re a white American it&apos;s actually pretty complicated, so I wanted to do a step-by-step showing exactly how you can almost guarantee yourself Chinese detention.</p>

<p><strong>How long were you detained?</strong> I was apprehended and held in custody for six days, but was only officially in the detention center for five days. They released me for some reason after five days, which was half the time that I was sentenced. </p>

<p><strong>I had no idea they had the authority to sentence a citizen from another country, I mean, you didn&apos;t even have a trial I assume.</strong> No, no I didn&apos;t have a trial and I wasn&apos;t charged with a crime. There is no judicial process, they simply pick you up and put you in detention and you pretty much just have to do whatever the hell they want. It&apos;s really amazing what absolute power means. They feel like they have absolute power in the U.S., and it&apos;s true if you&apos;re an Arab being suspected of terrorism, this country has absolute power and you have no rights. But for us white folks it&apos;s a really absurd concept that you can be detained indefinitely without ever being charged with a crime. </p>
