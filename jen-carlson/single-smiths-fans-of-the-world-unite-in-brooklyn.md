Last night a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501214003/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/29/pencil_this_in_-_thurs.php">Smiths speed dating</a> event went down in Greenpoint, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501214003/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/01/smiths_speed_dating_it_seemed.html">NY Mag</a> tossed themselves into the mix of single Moz fans. Sadly, but appropriately, it was as awkward as one might expect&#x2014; this charming man reports back: &quot;Among the single souls who turned up hoping to use mildly suicidal rock music as a basis for true love was your Intel correspondent&apos;s ex-girlfriend. Along with every other single girl in Brooklyn.&quot; It turns out too many women showed, throwing off the gender balance and forcing host Dave Hill to announce that &quot;we have to close the registration to women.&#x201D; which even meant &#x201C;The girl with the Smiths tattoos got turned away&#x201D;. Le sigh. Perhaps band-themed speed dating should be reserved for more upbeat groups like They Might Be Giants.</p>
