</div></div>					<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpjyAE7IPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303092256im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpjyAE7IPM.jpg" width="270" height="350" class="image-right"> </span>There are a few wooden homes on the Upper East Side that look like they belong in New England, or a Hollywood studio backlot, or Brooklyn Heights. 120, 122, and 160 East 92nd Street were all built between 1859 and 1871 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303092256/http://forgotten-ny.com/2014/10/houses-of-east-92nd-street/">are still standing today</a>. It&apos;s pretty astonishing, given the buildings weren&apos;t even landmarked when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303092256/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/28/brownstone.php">rows of homes were being leveled</a> on the UES in the 1950s. So if you ever wanted to live in a Civil War era house in NYC, now is your chance. You only need $18,500 a month! And probably really good credit.</p>

<p>120 East 92nd Street, which was landmarked in 1969, is now on the market as a rental property. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303092256/http://www.6sqft.com/miraculously-unscathed-by-time-this-historic-wooden-ues-townhouse-seeks-tenants/">6sqft</a>, the 3-story, 4-bedroom home is &quot;one of the last wood-frame houses to be built in Manhattan.&quot; From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303092256/http://streeteasy.com/building/120-east-92-street-manhattan/thouse">the listing</a>, which keeps trying to relate it to the English countryside: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;A delightful front porch greets you as you walk up to the residence. Upon entry, high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows grace the stunning parlor level which features a large and inviting living room with wood-burning fireplace, and an airy dining room. Also on this floor is a beautiful and comforting eat-in kitchen, completely updated with overhead lighting, a center island and a heart-warming traditional Aga cast iron oven, which reminds one of being in an English country manor...&quot;</blockquote>

<p>it goes on and on and like that, but never mentions the Civil War era ghosts or the mandatory Jane Austen readings in the parlor.</p>
