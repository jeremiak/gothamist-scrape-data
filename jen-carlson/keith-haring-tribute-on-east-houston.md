<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307164621/http://nylonmag.com/nylonblogs/blog/2008/04/18/happy-birthday-keith-haring">Nylon</a> has some shots of the new Keith Haring mural going up on E. Houston as a tribute to the artist on his upcoming birthday, May 4th. Still a work-in-progress, you can find it between Bowery and 2nd Avenue.</p>

<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307164621/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/harings-crack-is-wack-mural-is-being-restored/">Cityroom reported</a> that Haring&apos;s &quot;Crack is Whack&quot; mural in Harlem River Park is &quot;one of the only &#x2014; if not the only &#x2014; public art works by Haring still visible in New York City.&quot; However, later that year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307164621/http://www2.nysun.com/article/68386">the NY Sun</a> reported that &quot;an area of the American Textile Building in the TriBeCa neighborhood was discovered to contain a painting of Haring&apos;s from 1979.&quot;</p>
