This past Saturday the nationwide search focused in on New York, where a few dozen look-a-likes lined up for their shot to play Biggie on the big screen.</p>

<p>The requirements and a message from the producer are on  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175626/http://foxsearchlight.com/notorious">the casting site</a>, obviously one must meet the appearance test first. When the rapper (real name Christopher Wallace) died he was 24,  6&apos; 3&quot; and weighed about 300 pounds. Even meeting the physical requirements isn&apos;t a shoe-in for the role, however. Since Biggie grew up there, many Brooklynites are claiming they are the only ones who can really portray him accurately. One told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175626/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/10/07/2007-10-07_rappin_for_a_spot_in_biggie_smalls_bio_f.html">Daily News</a>: &quot;I&apos;ve got the swagger. I&apos;ve lived the life. I know what he went through and I think it would be all natural [for me to play him].&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175626/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/arts/music/08bigg.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin">The Times</a> also has some photos of the faux-Biggies. </p>

<p>Whoever gets cast will have to learn all of the pseudonyms the rapper went by, one of which was Frank White (taken from the lead character in <em>King of New York</em>). Recently (on October 5th) a new cafe/gallery called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175626/http://www.frankwhitenyc.com/">Frank White</a> opened in Brooklyn, and features a photo of Biggie to honor his memory. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175626/http://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/4/7182/1/">ClintonHillBlog</a> has some more info on the new social space, as well an interior shot (that&apos;s some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175626/http://www.flickr.com/photos/lesterhead/1406902951">nice wallpaper</a>). Frank White is located at 936 Atlantic Ave at St. James Place, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175626/http://www.clintonhillblog.com/?p=367">CHB notes</a> that this is just down the street from where the famed rapper grew up.</p>
