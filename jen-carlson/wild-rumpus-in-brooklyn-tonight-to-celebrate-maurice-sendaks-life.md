<p>There&apos;s going to be a Wild Rumpus tonight in Brooklyn to celebrate the life of Maurice Sendak, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509102858/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/maurice_sendak_where_the_wild_thing.php">who died earlier today</a> at his home in Connecticut. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509102858/https://twitter.com/#!/ronlieber">Ron Lieber</a>, who is helping to get the word out, tells us it will happen from 11 p.m. until midnight tonight at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509102858/http://congregationbethelohim.org/">Congregation Beth Elohim</a> in Park Slope&#x2014;&quot;bring books to read, memories, stories, songs, things to eat or drink. We&apos;re trying to get a batch of morning cake together, too. Rabbi Andy Bachman will preside.&quot;</p>

<p>Lieber explained that Rabbi Bachman &quot;dreamed this up,&quot; as he and co-organizer Cantor Josh Breitzer are both huge Sendak fans. And this afternoon Bachman told us why he was moved to organize the celebration: &quot;Maurice Sendak, a great son of Brooklyn, reminded us all that as children it was perfectly normal to fear the dark and allow our imaginations to provide light and comfort as we moved to other states of mind.  His wicked sense of humor and honesty are already greatly missed and since we now live in a world where one can literally see books disappearing, we could not think of a more fitting celebration of his heroic career than to read his words into the first dark night of our grief without him.&quot;</p>

<p>They&apos;re still pulling things together, but have organized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509102858/https://www.facebook.com/events/293565487397101/">a Facebook page</a> where they&apos;ll be posting more information as plans solidify. At press time it states, &quot;celebration of the life and work of this Brooklyn-born children&apos;s book artist... with a dark side. In the words of one fan, we will honor his memory by &apos;drinking/reading/musicking&apos; tonight in our Sanctuary alongside BanG Studio&apos;s Jacob&apos;s Ladder.&quot; You are also invited to bring a can of &quot;chicken soup with rice&quot; to donate to City Harvest.</p>
