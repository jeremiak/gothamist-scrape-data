<p>Red Hook resident and phenomenal actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/michael_shannon.php">Michael Shannon</a> has been out promoting his latest movie, <em> Nocturnal Animals</em>, but every Q&amp;A; he&apos;s sat down for has, instead, tuned us into his bleak thoughts on the current state of affairs in what he has dubbed &#x201C;the United States of Moronic Fucking Assholes.&quot; Shannon said in a recent interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://www.metro.us/entertainment/michael-shannon-don-t-talk-to-your-trump-voting-relatives/zsJpkn---pejocmaXnpaXY/">with Metro</a>, &quot;It should be talked about constantly. It should be the only thing anyone talks about.&quot; Below, an unfiltered Shannon wraps his beautiful, dark soul around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Trump&apos;s America</a>.</p>

<p><strong>On the election being rigged</strong><br>
&quot;On that day there were so many Trump voters who were saying, &apos;I voted for Trump, but it doesn&#x2019;t make a difference because they got it rigged anyway.&apos; Yeah, they sure fucking do, don&#x2019;t they? Fuckin&#x2019; A, man.&quot; (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://www.metro.us/entertainment/michael-shannon-don-t-talk-to-your-trump-voting-relatives/zsJpkn---pejocmaXnpaXY/">Metro</a>)</p>

<p><strong>On protests</strong><br>
&quot;These protests are so moving, but ultimately what are they going to accomplish... at the end of the day the guy&#x2019;s still going to be president. Maybe you need a civil war or something. We&#x2019;ve got to do something about it. I don&#x2019;t want to live in a country where people voted for Trump. I want to live in some other fucking country. But I don&#x2019;t want to run away. So we&#x2019;re just going to have to bust this thing up.&quot; (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://www.metro.us/entertainment/michael-shannon-don-t-talk-to-your-trump-voting-relatives/zsJpkn---pejocmaXnpaXY/">Metro</a>)</p>

<p><strong>On shit being fucked up and bullshit</strong><br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard a lot of people saying, &#x2018;Oh, we should give [Trump] a chance, it&#x2019;s not that bad.&#x2019; And I&#x2019;m like, &#x2018;No, you&#x2019;re wrong. Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/https://thinkprogress.org/white-nationalists-on-trumps-attorney-general-pick-it-s-like-christmas-caf3a87353f5#.vbpg1upl1">look at the news</a>. It is that bad.&#x2019;&quot; (via  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/17/michael-shannon-donald-trump">EW</a>)</p>

<p><strong>On Trump supporters</strong><br>
&quot;This country&#x2019;s filled with ignorant jackasses. The big red dildo running through the middle of our country needs to be annexed to be its own country of moronic assholes. I don&#x2019;t know how people got so goddamn stupid. But it&#x2019;s really weird, because it&#x2019;s like the last eight years, now it feels like a lie. Like, this has been festering underneath the whole time. Racists, sexists. </p>

<p>And a lot of these people, they don&#x2019;t know why the fuck they&#x2019;re alive. They know it. They&#x2019;re doing drugs, fucking killing themselves. Because they&#x2019;re like, &apos;Why the fuck am I alive? I can&#x2019;t get a job, I don&#x2019;t know anything about anything, I have no curiosity for life or the world.&apos; So this Trump thing is like getting a box of firecrackers, or something. It&#x2019;s like, &apos;Well, this will be fun for a little while, this&#x2019;ll kill some time.&apos; Because, y&#x2019;know, the jackass will be amusing on television, stay stupid shit. Make everybody clap. Hillary would have been too boring, I suppose. </p>

<p>It&#x2019;s the worst thing that&#x2019;s ever happened. It&#x2019;s the worst. This guy is going to destroy civilization as we know it, and the earth, and all because of these people who don&#x2019;t have any idea why they&#x2019;re alive.&quot; (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/you-cant-play-a-symbol-michael-shannon-on-nocturnal-animals">RogerEbert.com</a>)</p>

<p><strong>On how he&apos;s holding up</strong><br>
&quot;I&#x2019;m on tenterhooks here. I have two young children. Basically this man is probably going to destroy the earth and civilization as we know it. It&#x2019;s kind of terrifying.&quot; (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://www.metro.us/entertainment/michael-shannon-don-t-talk-to-your-trump-voting-relatives/zsJpkn---pejocmaXnpaXY/">Metro</a>)</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong><br>
&quot;I could use some vengeance right now, boy oh boy.&quot; (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144645/http://www.metro.us/entertainment/michael-shannon-don-t-talk-to-your-trump-voting-relatives/zsJpkn---pejocmaXnpaXY/">Metro</a>)</p>
