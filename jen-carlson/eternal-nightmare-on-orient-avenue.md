Four years after the cameras stopped rolling, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303061905/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/33/31_33_bm_crackhouse.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> takes a look at the house in its current state--and it&apos;s in no way ready for its next close-up.</p><blockquote><strong>Squatters, junkies, and prostitutes have turned the vacant building into a crackhouse</strong>, and residents of the tree-lined block say their safety is at risk.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;What was once a nice neighborhood is going downhill because that place is a haven for people who are using drugs,&#x201D; said architect Adam Kehr, who lives next door. <strong>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s scary. We have people walking across our property to go in there to do drugs at all hours of the night.&#x201D;</strong></p></blockquote>The house went vacant last winter when the owner moved out, and has been falling apart since--the building has even been on fire <em>twice</em> since abandoned. The new owners have put up a fence (though the permit expired in March), which the neighbors say make things worse as it provides a protective shield for trespassers to do illicit things. Allegedly the fence needs to be up in order &quot;to demolish the crackhouse to make room for a 20-unit condo,&quot; otherwise the necessary permits to tear it down cannot be obtained. Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303061905/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2007/03/house_of_the_da_272.php">Brownstoner</a> took a closer look at the Victorian-era house, before it became a squatter&apos;s paradise.<p></p>
