<p>FINE, let&apos;s talk about Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s new video, because even though these hyped up whatevers are usually just a huge letdown, the video for &quot;Countdown,&quot; off her album <em>4</em>, really is as amazing as The Internet says. And it&apos;s fun! And there&apos;s a lot of fashion! And it&apos;s generating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118005030/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672140/beyonce-countdown-video-reactions.jhtml">adorable headlines</a> like: &quot;Beyonce&apos;s &apos;Countdown&apos; Video A Unanimous Hit With Fans.&quot; The song is a tribute to her husband Jay-Z, and within the first 40 seconds she proudly flashes her pregnant belly. Listen, watch, enjoy:</p>
