</div></div>					<p>Reader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529102330/http://6of7.com/">David Velez</a> (link NSFW) sent us these photos of a sad looking panda walking around downtown at Battery Park late yesterday afternoon. Was he laid off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529102330/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/12/porcupine_gets_laid_off_at_bronx_zo.php">from the zoo</a>? He was carrying a Duane Reade bag and kept his head hung low as he walked amongst the humans. Aw, depression era panda, you make us so sad. (Though the eye witness pointed out this could be some sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529102330/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom#Role_playing">fetish</a> thing, in which case, gross.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems a lot of people have fallen in fascination with sad panda. One reader sent in more photos (including one where he is unmasked! Which we will not post here). Someone give sad panda a book deal, we bet he&apos;s seen a lot on the mean (Wall) streets.</p>
