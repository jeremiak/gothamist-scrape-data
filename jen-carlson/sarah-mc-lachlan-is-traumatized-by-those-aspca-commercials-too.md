<p>Since 2007, Sarah McLachlan&apos;s &quot;Angel&quot; has soundtracked an advertisement for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154251/http://gothamist.com/tags/aspca">the ASPCA</a>, a non-profit the singer is a spokesperson for. You know the one, because you have weeped watching it. You can probably recall it in your head if you should ever, for some reason, need a good cry. It has traumatized the nation, Sarah McLachlan included. Here, let it break you again: </p>

<p>Every few years someone asks her about the 2-minute ad, which features slow-motion shots zooming in on literal sad puppy dog eyes, clips of injured animals that have suffered abuse, and a plea for your help, which of course you&apos;ll give because you&apos;re no monster. </p>

<p>This time around she told the blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154251/http://www.makers.com/blog/sarah-mclachlan-aspca-psa-commercial-truth">Makers</a>, &quot;I can&#x2019;t watch them! It just kills me... the mix of the music and my sad face... it was brutal doing those ads.&#x201D; On the upside? &quot;I got a whole new audience out of it. I swear I&#x2019;d be at Target in Missouri at 10 o&#x2019;clock at night getting off the tour bus and I&#x2019;d be going down the aisle and these two little old ladies would be like, &#x2018;Are you that dog lady? I love that song!&#x2019; Daily. Daily this would happen.&#x201D;</p>

<p>However, last time McLachlan was asked about the ads, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154251/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/05/sarah-mclachlan-aspca_n_5267840.html">she said</a>, &quot;Do I want to be remembered just for that? Absolutely not. I mean, I love animals absolutely; but, if I want to think about what my legacy would be, it would be more about kids and music, which is sort of my true passion.&quot; It was noted at the time that around $30 million was raised for the ASCPA via those ads, which isn&apos;t too bad to have on your legacy resume.</p>

<p>Now, here&apos;s a palate cleanser to watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154251/http://aspca.org/donate">while you donate</a>: </p>
