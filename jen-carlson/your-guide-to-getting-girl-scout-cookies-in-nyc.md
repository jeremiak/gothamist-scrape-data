<p>We&apos;ve been hearing delicious rumors that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226111828/http://www.girlscoutcookies.org/">Girl Scout cookies</a> have hit the streets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226111828/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/girl_scout_cookies.php">once again</a>, so we contacted our hook-up at the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York to find out where New Yorkers can get some. After all, what better to compliment your seasonal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226111828/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/mcdonalds_shamrock_shakes_have_arri.php">Shamrock Shake</a> than a Thin Mint? Here&apos;s all the information you shall need in your quest for the treats, including the nutritional information for the cookies available this year (sorry).<br>
</p><ul><li>The pop-up shops will be open from March 14th to May 5th. There will be five around the city, which you can locate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226111828/http://girlscoutsnyc.com/Common/CookiesPopUps.html">here</a>.<br>
</li><li>The Girl Scouts have introduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226111828/http://cookielocator.littlebrownie.com/">a Girl Scout Cookie Locator app</a> for smart phones&#x2014;you can find Girl Scouts just by typing your zip code across the country.<br>
</li><li>Girl Scout Cookies cost $4 per box.  We are selling six varieties (Samoas, Thin Mints, Trefoils, Tagalongs, Do-Si-Dos and Lemon Chalet Cremes) this year.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>So yeah, if you&apos;re jonesing for a Tagalong, there&apos;s an app for that!</p>
