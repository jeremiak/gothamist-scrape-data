<p>Earlier this week Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Astronaut who currently resides <em>in space</em>, transmitted this photo from aboard the International Space Station. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103224/https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/315492774164180994/photo/1">Tweeted</a>: &quot;New York City, lit up like a bulb. The Statue of Liberty is clearly visible in the night from above.&quot;</p>

<p>His original plan was to capture the Earth Hour efforts of various cities as they turned their lights off for 60 minutes last Saturday, but when he was unable to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103224/https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/statuses/315419795522723841">because</a> &quot;orbital mechanics don&apos;t support seeing lights out efforts.&quot; <em>Likely story.</em></p>

<p>Instead, he went the other way and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103224/http://www.geekosystem.com/chris-hadfield-pics-earth-hour/">captured the cities</a> lit up at night, which is prettier anyway... if you&apos;re into seeing epic photos from space of your city looking like a magical, twinkly set of Christmas lights. Otherwise this photo probably just makes you feel tiny and insignificant, like you&apos;re staring&#x2014;all alone&#x2014;into the void of a life and city you once knew.</p>
