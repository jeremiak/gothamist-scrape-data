</div></div><p>Last year there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110504060441/http://www.beforethetrailer.com/tag/mib3-filming-locations-and-information-in-new-york-city/">casting call</a> for <em>Men In Black III</em>, where a call out specified &quot;people that are less than 4&#x2019;10 and more than 6&#x2019;5 in height to play aliens. Men and women to play late 1960s New Yorkers.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110504060441/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2011/03/25/men-in-black-3-open-casting-call-in-nyc/">Another</a> last month noted they were still looking for &quot;1969 New Yorkers (hippies, beatnik poets, 60s celebrity look-a-likes, bikers, models, etc)&quot; and explained &quot;most scenes take place in 1969 and men and women must be willing to get a hair cut and to work around smoke.&quot;</p>

<p>This week the production is shooting on Surf Avenue in Coney Island, and a ton of extras&#x2014;including Lola Star&#x2014;have been called in for a boardwalk scene. Star has been transmitting photos from the &quot;past&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110504060441/http://twitter.com/#!/lola_star_">via Twitter</a> all day, and you can check out a few above. Apparently Smith was about to film a chase scene down the boardwalk just before one of them was taken.</p>
