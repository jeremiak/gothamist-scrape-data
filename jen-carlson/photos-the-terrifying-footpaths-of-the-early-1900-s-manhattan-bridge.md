</div></div>					<p>Construction for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620203756/http://gothamist.com/tags/manhattanbridge">Manhattan Bridge</a> started in 1901, and the structure officially opened to traffic on December 31st, 1909... but between the beginning and the end it was necessary for workers to reach certain areas and heights. Enter: these terrifying footpaths. In a 1908 issue of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620203756/http://books.google.com/books?id=qYIlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA335&amp;lpg=PA335&amp;dq=old+temporary+manhattan+bridge+footpaths&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C3xjULaKHl&amp;sig=QoPnBZRu8v0G2rhKlePgq1zsnnc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4AMFU8KQL4HM0wHC-YGoDA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=old%20temporary%20manhattan%20bridge%20footpaths&amp;f=false">Good Roads magazine</a> they were described as such:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The interesting feature in the present stage of construction of the Manhattan Bridge is the false work of stringing the ponderous cables. Walks, or platforms, have been built about 30 ins. below the wires for the use of the workmen who will make the cables. Each of these four platforms is 8 ft. wide and is concentric with the cable. The flooring is of planks laid crossways of the platform, spaced apart sufficiently to afford foothold, each of which is securely clamped to the cable stringers which form the supports, and each cable is protected by a pair of hand-rails of wire rope.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>While they weren&apos;t open to the public, there&apos;s a pretty good chance regular citizens dared to cross them. There were similar footpaths on the Brooklyn Bridge (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620203756/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2013/05/23/the-first-man-to-ever-cross-the-brooklyn-bridge/">a makeshift zipline</a>), which&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620203756/http://www.amazon.com/Great-Bridge-Story-Building-Brooklyn/dp/067145711X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392838206&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brooklyn+bridge">David McCullough&apos;s fantastic book</a>&#x2014;would often see some unsavory activity (according to him, higher ups would bring women of ill-repute up there!). </p>
