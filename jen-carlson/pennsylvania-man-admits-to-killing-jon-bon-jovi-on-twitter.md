<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="jonbonjersey1211.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104092649im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jonbonjersey1211.jpeg" width="350" height="303" class="image-right"> </span>Twitter death hoaxes, so amusing if you&apos;re soulless and also aren&apos;t a friend or family member or fan of the person whose death is being spread by ReTweets. Anyway, as you know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104092649/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/jon_bon_jovi_still_alive.php">Jon Bon Jovi is still with us</a>, but for a short time earlier this month he was declared dead via a rumor that spread quickly online. Who was behind the rumor&#x2014;a scorned lover? An ex-manager? Sebastian Bach, for some reason? No! It was a lone wolf in Pennsylvania, who acted alone after being frustrated with JBJ&apos;s recent career path. </p>

<p>Jeffrey Goho told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104092649/http://www.app.com/article/20111226/NJNEWS/312260077/Pa-man-who-sparked-Bon-Jovi-death-rumor-I-m-getting-a-lot-of-backlash-from-it">Asbury Park Press</a> that he was frustrated the rocker was focusing more on business endeavors and not The Music. Goho, also a musician, told them <strong>&quot;All I heard was &apos;Bon Jovi this,&apos; &apos;Bon Jovi&apos;s starting a restaurant.&apos; What was the latest one? The Advil commercial? It was like, &apos;Jeez, [Bon Jovi] was a household name due to music, not business.&apos;</strong> Long story short, I was talking to my band members. and we got so worked up in the conversation, I just kind of took the liberty and started (the rumor), because I was so irritated.&quot; Sure, no one should be focusing on movies like <em>New Year&apos;s Eve</em>, but let&apos;s not deprive the world of movies like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104092649/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113851/"><em>Moonlight and Valentino</em></a> featuring a young Jon Bon honing his acting skills (seriously, when is this coming to Netflix Instant?).</p>

<p>In the end, Goho sort of admits he was wrong (he probably should have just made a video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104092649/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/07/video_new_yorkers_want_justin_timbe.php">like this</a>), and claims he &quot;never really thought it would get out of the state of Pennsylvania.&quot; But Goho, even Jersey has the internet!
