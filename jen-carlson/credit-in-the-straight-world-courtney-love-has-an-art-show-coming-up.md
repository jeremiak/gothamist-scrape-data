<p>Last weekend Courtney Love regrouped with the former (and original) members of Hole for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419055928/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/14/video_hole_reunite_at_surprise_show.php">small reunion at Public Assembly</a> in Williamsburg (for the first time in at least 13 years!), and now she&apos;s channeling her creative energy into her <em>visual</em> art. (Which is probably better than channeling it into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419055928/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/12/frances_bean_releases_statement_twi.php">140 character</a> lexical gems.) This afternoon Courtney Tweeted, &quot;Art show in 2 weeks y&apos;all. Fred Torres collaborations!&quot; Adding that it would open on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419055928/https://twitter.com/#!/Courtney/status/192685193511976961/photo/1">May 3rd</a>.</p>

<p>The show, called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419055928/http://www.fredtorres.com/exhibition-space/2012-05-03_courtney-love/">And She&apos;s Not Even Pretty!</a>&quot; will run through June 15th at Fred Torres Collaborations (527 West 29th Street), but Courtney has been Tweeting out sketches for a while now. And while C. Lo has often mentioned the importance of moving forward creatively, this is all very reminiscent of &apos;90s Hole, no? Maybe we&apos;re just being thrown off by the manic vibe and the use of the word &quot;pretty.&quot;</p>
