</div></div>					<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525134451/http://www.bkmag.com/BrooklynAbridged/archives/2012/07/31/a-look-inside-the-brooklyn-issue-of-a-1974-new-york-news-magazine?showFullText=true">Brooklyn Magazine</a> is taking a look back at the borough as it was portrayed in the October 1974 issue of New York News Magazine. The now defunct publication seems to have covered a range of topics, from discos to the city&apos;s sanitation men, and while there is little trace of it online, we did find these covers from other issues from that decade. Click back to get your 1970s New York headlines, and head <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525134451/http://www.bkmag.com/BrooklynAbridged/archives/2012/07/31/a-look-inside-the-brooklyn-issue-of-a-1974-new-york-news-magazine?showFullText=true">over here</a> for a closer look at the Brooklyn issue, which offers &quot;priceless time-capsule glimpses of the past, from photographs of models and boarded-up homes to advertisements for malls and gentrification.&quot;</p>
