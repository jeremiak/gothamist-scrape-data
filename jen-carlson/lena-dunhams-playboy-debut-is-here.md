<p>Dunham also discussed New York City, and having created a fairly realistic snapshot of a certain part of Brooklyn on <em>Girls</em> (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105321/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/lena_dunham_interview_1.php">we discussed with her</a> last year), she gets into how her home-borough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105321/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">is portrayed</a> on other shows.</p>

<blockquote><strong><em>Girls</em> is set in Brooklyn. What does the media get wrong about New York&#x2019;s hippest borough?</strong> I don&#x2019;t live in the same Brooklyn neighborhood as my characters; mine [Brooklyn Heights] is slightly more old-people-y. But I&#x2019;m a Brooklyn girl and love it. The first time I watched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105321/http://gothamist.com/tags/2brokegirls"><em>2 Broke Girls</em></a>, another Brooklyn show, I liked it, but there were  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105321/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_two_broke_girls_b.php#photo-7">people in Williamsburg saying</a>, &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t go out in that jacket in Brooklyn. You&#x2019;re going to get robbed!&#x201D; Many parts of Brooklyn are tony suburbs of Manhattan, but the most interesting thing is the push-pull and the collision of young meets old, historic meets new. Most people don&#x2019;t look at that. Also, not everyone has a handlebar mustache.</blockquote>
