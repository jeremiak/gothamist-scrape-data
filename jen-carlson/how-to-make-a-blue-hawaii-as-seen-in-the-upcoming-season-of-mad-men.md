<p>The people behind <em>The Unofficial Mad Men Cookbook</em> have taken some cues from the photos snapped on location for the upcoming season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145505/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> (premiering this Sunday), to offer up some <em>in-season</em> recipes. For example, Megan was spotted drinking a bright blue cocktail on the beach during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145505/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/mad_men_is_filming_what_clues_are_i.php">the shooting of one scene</a> that was captured by paparazzi&#x2014;this was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145505/http://unofficialmadmencookbook.com/blog/aloha-mad-men-toast-season-6-with-a-blue-hawaii/">a Blue Hawaii</a>, which actually made its debut on the show during season 4 (when Joan prepares a Hawaiian-themed New Year&#x2019;s Eve dinner).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145505/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/mad_men_cookbook.php">The experts</a> say this bright blue concoction was &quot;a popular cocktail in the 1960s... [and] grew out of Americans&apos; infatuation with the nation&apos;s newest state... the Blue Hawaii is not truly of Hawaiian origin. The Bols liquor company, maker of blue cura&#xE7;ao, was looking for a way to increase sales of the product and asked a bartender at Waikiki&#x2019;s Hawaiian Village Hotel to come up with a cocktail that would parlay Hawaii&#x2019;s popularity into revenues.&quot; If you want to mix one up for your <em>Mad Men</em> party or to drink alone while you watch the premiere (it&apos;s okay), here&apos;s how:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Blue Hawaii</strong>

<p>    3 ounces pineapple juice<br>
    1 &#xBD; ounces light rum<br>
    1 ounce sweet and sour mix (see recipe for homemade sweet and sour mix)<br>
    1 ounce Blue Cura&#xE7;ao<br>
    1 ounce lemon juice<br>
    1 small cube fresh pineapple, plus a wedge for garnish<br>
    1 maraschino cherry, for garnish<br>
    Homemade Sweet and Sour Mix<br>
    &#xBE; cup water<br>
    &#xBE; cup sugar<br>
    &#xBD; cup fresh lemon juice<br>
    &#xBD; cup fresh lime juice</p>

<p>    To make the drink: In the container of a blender, mix pineapple juice, rum, sweet and sour mix, blue Cura&#xE7;ao, lemon juice and small cube of pineapple. Add &#xBD; cup crushed ice and blend.<br>
    Pour into a punch glass and garnish with a cherry and a small wedge of fresh pineapple.<br>
    To make the Homemade Sweet and Sour Mix: Combine water and sugar in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil. Remove from heat and cool.<br>
    In a pitcher, combine syrup, lemon juice and lime juice. Refrigerate until cold.</p></blockquote><p></p>
