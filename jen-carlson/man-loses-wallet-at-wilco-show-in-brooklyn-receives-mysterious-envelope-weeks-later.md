title: Man Loses Wallet At Wilco Show In Brooklyn, Receives Mysterious Envelope Weeks Later
---

	
										<p>Lower East Side resident Reilly Flaherty lost his wallet at a Wilco show in Brooklyn on February 5th, but he has now received his 15 minutes of fame in return. </p>

<p>The person who found his wallet sent him a letter that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813001941/https://www.instagram.com/p/BB1EVOOlH9h/">posted on Instagram</a>, and it immediately went viral&#x2014;it read: &quot;Dear Reilly Flaherty, I found your wallet and your drivers license had your address so here&apos;s your credit cards and other important stuff. I kept the cash because I needed weed, the MetroCard because well the fare&apos;s $2.75 now, and the wallet cause it&apos;s kinda cool. Enjoy the rest of your day. Toodles, Anonymous.&quot; Do you see a glass half full of restored faith in humanity or a glass half empty of restored faith in humanity?</p>

<p>Flaherty won&apos;t say how much cash was taken, but he added that on top of that there was also a $10 Barnes &amp; Noble gift certificate and a Mr. Shiny&#x2019;s shoeshine loyalty card&#x2014;both of which were not returned. As for the credit cards, he had already cancelled them by the time the mysterious envelope arrived two weeks later.</p>

<p>He told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813001941/http://nypost.com/2016/02/16/i-needed-weed-man-who-found-wallet-returns-license-not-cash/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">the NY Post</a>, &quot;I quickly went from being hysterical to like, this guy is selfish. It speaks to the New York mentality: I&#x2019;m going to be nice but there&#x2019;s going to be an asterisk.&quot;</p>

<p>In other comments he&apos;s called the thief a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813001941/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-receives-new-york-note-loses-wallet-article-1.2534140">modern day Robin Hood</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813001941/http://mashable.com/2016/02/16/lost-wallet-note/#2smGPNBnLuq0">the Walter White of wallet returning</a>.&quot; But if Howard Pyle or <em>Breaking Bad</em> isn&apos;t your thing, Flaherty also included a <em>Good Will Hunting</em> reference: &quot;If I could say one thing to this altruistic stranger, I would tell them, &apos;It&apos;s not your fault. It is not your fault.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps the MTA and the good people at Mr. Shiny can team up to track this person down through MetroCard use and shoe shines.</p>
