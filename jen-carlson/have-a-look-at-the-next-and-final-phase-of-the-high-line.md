</div></div><p>Last October, the final phase of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031933/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">the High Line</a> was unveiled in all of its neglected glory during Open House NY&#x2014;you can see photos of the undeveloped outdoor space as it looks now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031933/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/the_high_line_phase_iii.php#photo-1">right here</a>, and now renderings of what it will look like by the end of next year have arrived. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031933/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/plans-for-the-final-section-of-the-high-line/">third and final phase</a> is being called &quot;The High Line at the Rail Yards&quot; and will dodge in and out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031933/http://gothamist.com/tags/hudsonyards">Hudson Yards</a> project, starting up where the first two phases left off&#x2014;running from 30th to 34th Streets. The plans include play sections for kids, as well an amphitheater performance space at 30th and 10th.</p>

<p>While construction will be done by the end of next year, the grand public opening won&apos;t take place until spring of 2014. Can you believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031933/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/01/highline_constr.php">it&apos;s been six years</a> since we first started talking about construction happening for phase I of the High Line?</p>
