<p>Can we all just agree that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074007/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> <em>isn&apos;t</em> some mind-blowing, game-changing, totally original pop star? She cops her looks from Paris Fashion Week shows and pawns them off as her own, so it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if she stole her persona from someone lesser known. Say, from her friend who committed suicide at age 19. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074007/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gaga_owes_my_kid_for_fame_NyfPkmLNGBjhWSj6WHXaNL">the NY Post</a>, Lina Morgana&apos;s mother Yana claims that her dead daughter was the inspiration for Gaga&apos;s persona. The two <em>did</em> work on songs together (they were introduced by producer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074007/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/19/lady_gaga.php">Rob Fusari</a>), and Lina&apos;s style does look like it transferred over to Gaga at some point. See for yourself in this video Yana put together: </p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1IJDS2uPLVk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074007oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/1IJDS2uPLVk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>Yana told the paper that she has no plans to file a lawsuit, she simply wants her daughter to get her due; &quot;<strong>I&apos;m doing this because I want to keep her spirit alive. Lady Gaga is holding Lina&apos;s soul</strong>, and I want her soul to be free. Every other word [Gaga] says is from Lina. She talks about having a dark and tragic life, but she had everything she wanted in the world. She went to [the same] high school as Nicky Hilton, her parents were rich. But Lina did have a tough life, and she often talked about her tragic life.&quot;</p>

<p>After Fusari&apos;s introduction, Lina and Gaga wrote about a dozen songs together all recorded but never commercially released. (One of those songs, <em>Wonderland</em>, is below.) Yana claims that &quot;Lina had that style. Gaga had a different style. She changed dramatically overnight.&quot;</p>

<p>Tragically, Lina took her own life by jumping from a hotel on Staten Island, and one month later (then) Stefani Germanotta made her transformation to Lady Gaga. Lina&apos;s former boyfriend said the first time he saw the transformation, he was shocked&#x2014;he told the paper, <strong>&quot;It was the same style, the same look, the same music, the same voice, the same jaw line&#x2014;the way they expressed themselves. It was so, so shocking. It was like looking at a ghost.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The video Yana Morgana created and put up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074007/http://www.youtube.com/user/LinaNYC">her daughter&apos;s YouTube page</a> has now been made private, but you can see two of Lina&apos;s videos below:</p>
