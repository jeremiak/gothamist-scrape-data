</div></div>					<p>Last night was the press preview for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163028/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/18/courtney_love_4.php">Courtney Love&apos;s art show</a>, entitled <em>And She&apos;s Not Even Pretty</em>, which will be on exhibit at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163028/http://www.fredtorres.com/">Fred Torres Collaborations</a> starting tomorrow and through June 15th. We headed over to Chelsea for the 5 p.m. opening&#x2014;after being told by coworkers covering the much more &quot;important&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163028/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/photos_euphoric_may_day_march_follo.php#photo-19">May Day events</a>, &quot;have fun at your 1% art party!&quot; We did, and there was a lot of free wine.</p>

<p>The gallery is a couple floors up from the desolate stretch of 29th Street, and you&apos;re immediately greeted with what appear to be 45 self-portraits of Love herself. The artist (stop snickering) would later tell us that these weren&apos;t <em>all </em>of her, explaining somewhat mysteriously, &quot;Sometimes... but sometimes no. I hope the girl doesn&apos;t recognize herself if she comes. <em>If</em> she&apos;s coming, and I don&apos;t want her to... it&apos;s kind of violent.&quot; So presumably some of these manic pastels are portraying someone else in Love&apos;s life... and our money is on Gwyneth Paltrow (whom she mentions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163028/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/27/courtney-love-art-exhibit-and-shes-not-even-pretty_n_1456702.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">in the video</a> explaining her artwork).</p>

<p>Love was visibly uncomfortable with her new art world surroundings, which greatly differed from the atmosphere of a late night dimly lit rock show, and upon getting to the gallery she retreated immediately to a back office where she surrounded herself in the safety of cigarette smoke. And who can blame her? When she first walked in at least ten young media women&#x2014;each in their own way echoing her &apos;90s Hole days style&#x2014;flocked around her. But this was something new for Love; she wasn&apos;t here to scream a song in a babydoll dress, she was here <em>to bare her</em> older and more tattered soul, in a new way. She told us, &quot;It feels more vulnerable, it&apos;s not like music where you mix it and put it out there and go hide.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the work itself, even if it was a little repetitive, we enjoyed it. Each piece <em>gives</em> a lot, leaking out hidden bits of whatever may be lurking in the dark corners of Love&apos;s mind. And what was on her mind last night was probably aptly summed up by the words on the first piece you see upon entering the gallery. They read: &quot;I&apos;m a celebrity get me out of here. Don&apos;t you know who I am?&quot; In the midst of a gaggle of media people belting out questions, the woman accompanying Love said, &quot;You want to just get up and walk out?&quot; And off she went.</p>
