<p>Real estate blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162848/http://www.movoto.com/blog/novelty-real-estate/ghostbusters-firehouse-for-sale/">Movoto</a> did some research to find out how much the Ghostbusters Firehouse would be worth in today&apos;s market, and guess what they found out? Egon, Ray, and Peter would have a rough time paying the bills at Hook &amp; Ladder 8... probably? Someone go figure out how much money <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162848/http://gothamist.com/tags/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a> make.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how they broke it down: </p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong> 9,642.55-square-feet<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> 14 North Moore Street<br>
<strong>Price:</strong> Based on comparable properties in that area, that&apos;s about $1,630 per square foot... or $15,717,356.50 total. (Or 642 tons of marshmallows.)</p>

<p>Other things to keep in mind when playing this game: these guys lived there 30 years ago when prices were different and &quot;the firehouse was in a state of severe disrepair.&quot; Also, this was a live <em>and</em> work space, that included a garage.</p>

<p>But what else do you get for all that dough? Based on <em>Ghostbusters</em> layouts found online, the space includes an ECTO-1 bay, reception area, an office, basement, sub-basement (or ghost containment area), kitchen, dining room, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162848/http://gothamist.com/tags/billmurray">Bill Murray</a>, a laboratory, sleeping quarters, and bathrooms. And that&apos;s a lot more, and $3 million less, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162848/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/07/insane_dumbo_clocktower_apartment_o.php">than the DUMBO Clocktower penthouse</a>.</p>
