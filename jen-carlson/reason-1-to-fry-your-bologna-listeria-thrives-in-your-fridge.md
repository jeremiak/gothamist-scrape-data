<span class="photo_caption">When considering a sliced meat purchase, always go for the more expensive $1.49 kind (photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165545/http://www.flickr.com/photos/milkshakepants/2559671627/">milkshakepants&apos; flickr</a>)</span></p>

<p>Your bologna has a first name, it&apos;s l-i-s-t-e-r-i-a. It&apos;s been discovered that the nasty little bacteria that can cause food poisoning (and possibly <em>death</em>) has adapted to survive refrigerator temperatures! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165545/http://www.boingboing.net/2011/05/05/listeria-evolved-to.html">Boing Boing</a>, cold cuts are basically hostels for listeria, and &quot;all it takes is some improper handling of the meat, somewhere along the production chain, and a little listeria can bloom&#x2014;inside your fridge&#x2014;into a potentially serious problem.&quot; The scienticians at Bovine University never mentioned this...</p>

<p>...but the American Meat Institute did&#x2014;the group says heating meat to 165 degrees is a good idea for at-risk individuals (people over 50, and pregnant women). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165545/http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/medical/2011-05-04-listeria-cdc-lunch-meat_n.htm">Something the CDC agrees with</a>.</p>

<p>This is, of course, another reason to always fry your bologna&#x2014;get a pre-made fried bologna sandwich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165545/http://www.eatthisny.com/2011/04/19/tonys-100-best-10/36-fried-bologna-sandwich-at-seersucker/">at Seersucker</a> in Brooklyn, or at home you can simply follow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165545/http://www.food.com/recipe/fried-bologna-sandwich-133272">the world&apos;s most depressing recipe</a>! And don&apos;t forget to slather on the mustard (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165545/http://www.menshealth.com/mhlists/foodborne_illness/Cold_Cuts.php">researchers</a> killed off 90 percent of three pathogens&#x2014;Listeria, E. coli, and Salmonella&#x2014;within 2 hours of exposing them to a mustard compound).</p>
