<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202833/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynbridgepark">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a> expanding (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202833/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/photos_pier_5_opens_in_brooklyn_bri.php#photo-1">Pier 5 is now open</a>!), some new concessionaires are being brought into the area. Today BBP announced that they&apos;ll be adding new food options to Pier 5, Pier 6 and Fulton Ferry Landing near Pier 1&#x2014;with mainstays like the Brooklyn Bridge Wine Bar sticking around. Here&apos;s the breakdown of the new additions: </p>

<p><strong>PIER 6:</strong> Fornino, operating out of the restaurant space (their pizza and boccacino sandwiches will replace Bark Dogs)</p>

<p><strong>PIER 5:</strong> Ample Hills Creamery, operating out of a new concession stand</p>

<p><strong>FULTON FERRY LANDING</strong>: Luke&apos;s Lobster (Lobster rolls, gluten-free soups, grilled cheese!) and No. 7 Sub (Turkey Meatloaf, Zucchini Parm!), operating under the Brooklyn Bridge in the Smokestack Building</p>

<p>These will all open for the spring/summer season, along with returning concessions, including the aforementioned Brooklyn Bridge Wine Bar, Blue Marble Ice Cream, and Calexico Carne Asada (which will move its mobile cart out of Pier 1 and onto Plymouth and Main Streets). Smorgasburg will also be returning to the park in April with their weekly food market at the Tobacco Warehouse.</p>
