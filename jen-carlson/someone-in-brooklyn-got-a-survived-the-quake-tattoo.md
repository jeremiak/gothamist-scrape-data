<p>Really, Brooklyn? Citizen Ink Studios in Sheepshead Bay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504164830/http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2011/08/nothing-says-survived-the-quake-like-a-tattoo/">is offering up</a> a &quot;Survived the Quake&quot; tattoo to their customers... and people are getting it! 25-year-old owner Joe Khay says it took him five minutes to sketch the design, which he posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504164830/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Citizen-Ink">on Facebook</a> and was meant to be a joke. But Jonathan Berg, a 21-year-old regular customer, came in and got the design permanently inked onto his torso for $30. </p>

<p>Berg told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504164830/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/25/2011-08-25_tats_all_he_wrote_about_miniquake_ink_artist_finds_at_least_1_taker.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;It was just that people were freaking out. It was just a minor thing, and people were making it into a serious subject. I thought that was pretty hilarious.&quot; </p>

<p>Apparently three others have asked for the quake tattoo, but maybe they should hold out for the Hurricane Irene one.</p>
