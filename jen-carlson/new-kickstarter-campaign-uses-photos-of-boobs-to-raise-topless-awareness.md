</div></div>					<p>We all know by now that being topless is totally legal in New York whether you are a man or a woman, right? But there&apos;s nothing wrong with drawing some more attention to that fact, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231511/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/east_village_topless_woman_gets_sup.php">the young woman baring her breasts</a> in the East Village has been doing lately. And now the man behind the Topless New York series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231511/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1047897717/topless-new-york-exhibit-calendar-and-book">has launched a Kickstarter</a> to raise funds for an exhibit showing years of his photographs documenting The Cause.  </p>

<p>As usual, if you want to see boobs, you&apos;re gonna have to pay. At press time the Kickstarter only has 95 bucks, of the $10,000 it needs, so loosen those pursestrings. And while you do that, we asked Mr. Topless New York what got him into this in the first place (attachment parenting?)&#x2014;he told us: &quot;I first became intrigued by the unusual law in NY when I was in law school, but it wasn&apos;t until a few years later, in 2007, that I decided that it was important to raise awareness about it, and concluded that putting together a series of photos might be the way to do it.&quot; But does he get criticized or called a &quot;pervert&quot; for his work? <strong>&quot;I&apos;ve never been called a &apos;pervert&apos; for doing this project&#x2014;I&apos;ve certainly heard a few expressions of displeasure during a shoot, but they&apos;re typically directed at the model who&apos;s daring to offend traditional sensibilities by exercising her equal rights under the law, not at me.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Click through for a look at the result of some of these shoots, and what he&apos;ll have on view if his project gets funded. Needless to say, they are NSFW!</p>
