<p>A recent YouTube video (below) chronicles the infuriating money-making operation of one shady midtown entrepreneur who blocks off desirable parking spots with orange cones in front of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813000150/http://www.philippechow.com/">Philippe Restaurant</a> (located on East 60th Street and Madison). He then sells the parking spots to customers of the restaurant for $40 (<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813000150/https://twitter.com/PhilippeChow/status/267844929135460352">customers like Chris Cornell and the Biebs</a>?</em>). So what&apos;s the story behind this scam, which has already brought down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813000150/http://www.yelp.com/biz/philippe-new-york">the restaurant&apos;s Yelp rating</a> by at least one star? We&apos;ve reached out to the owners, and Stratis Morfogen told us this morning:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;He does not work for us and I&apos;ve called the police a thousand times.  This was happening over the summer.  In the beginning he told us he was homeless and hungry so we would make him a hot meal.   Then he started his own business on the street... That&apos;s when we warned him not to do this and then finally involved the police after he became hostile towards my staff.  It hasn&apos;t happened since the police threatened to lock him up.  He comes by and we tell him please do not hang out here, or we have to call the police.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>While the police are definitely involved in the below video, it also seems as though a restaurant employee is amicably communicating with the man selling the spot. Not to mention the cones seem to be stored on restaurant property, which the police also make note of. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813000150/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/14/fancy_ues_restaurant_allegedly_has.php">Maybe they get stored in the weed room</a>? </p>

<p>To be sure, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813000150/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/11/parking_lot_caught_selling_metered.php">this is an old trick</a>, but we&apos;re still curious&#x2014;if anyone out there has witnessed this particular scam, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813000150/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">email us</a> so we can get to the bottom of who is really behind this.
