<p>Perhaps prompted by the paparazzi type photos popping up, Christopher Nolan has decided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114226/http://www.thedarkknightrises.com/selina_kyle.html">to release</a> a first look at Anne Hathaway&apos;s Catwoman in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114226/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a>. Though she looks a little more Selina Kyle than Catwoman here&#x2014;<em>where are the cattributes?</em> Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114226/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2022692/First-official-picture-Anne-Hathaway-Catwoman-The-Dark-Knight-Rises.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">more photos here</a>, where Hathaway appears to be driving the Batpod herself! </p>

<p>How does she match up to her predecessors?</p>
