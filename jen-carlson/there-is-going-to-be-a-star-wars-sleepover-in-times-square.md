										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="tauntaunsleeping.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150319163305im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/tauntaunsleeping.jpg" width="350" height="240"> <br> <i>BYO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150319163305/http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/plush/bb2e/?cpg=froogle">Tauntun sleeping bag</a></i></div> Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not! is hosting the universe&apos;s biggest sleepover for Star Wars nerds in the history of the world, or galaxy, or whatever. This will all go down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150319163305/http://www.ripleysnewyork.com/news/12-January/Calling-All-JEDI-WARRIORS.cfm">on February 10th</a>, in celebration of <em>Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace</em> returning to theaters in 3-D. There will be Yoda mask making, puppet making, and Wookie cookie decorating... really! They say &quot;the epic space series themed sleepover will also include a character meet and greet, Ripley&#x2019;s Impossible LaseRace, and more.&quot; How much more? Who knows, but they&apos;re calling it EXTREME.<p></p>

<p>Admission is a whopping $145 per person (with a portion of the proceeds given to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150319163305/http://www.puppetryarts.org/Home.html">Puppetry Arts</a>, a Brooklyn based non-profit organization)... but keep in mind, you may end up spooning with a special someone from the 501st Legion&#x2019;s Empire City Garrison or the Rebel Legion&#x2019;s Echo Base. Plus, a pizza dinner, snacks and breakfast from THE Applebee&#x2019;s. </p>

<p>The event is suitable for children ages 6 and up... but let&apos;s face it, this thing is going to be filled with grown men. (AVAILABLE grown men, ladies!)</p>
