<p>Just an hour outside of the city, at Greg&apos;s Auto Repair shop in Florence, New Jersey, sits Adolf Hitler&apos;s toilet. The toilet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905145255/http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/22714">which still works</a>, was acquired by Greg Kohfeldt when he bought Sam Carlani&#x2019;s auto repair shop two decades ago, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905145255/http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/122641/hitlers-toilet-is-in-new-jersey">to Tablet</a>. The toilet is reportedly from Hitler&apos;s private 400-foot yacht, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905145255/http://strangevehicles.greyfalcon.us/AVISO%20GRILLE.htm">the Aviso Grille</a>, which even included a private room for Eva Braun... so maybe this was her toilet? DNA was never swiped from the porcelain piece so we&apos;ll just <em>never know</em>. But we do know how it ended up in Dirty Jerz.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Aviso Grille played a significant role in one particular moment in history: Hitler&#x2019;s Grand Admiral Karl D&#xF6;nitz stood on the deck of the ship on May 1, 1945, and gave the first word of the F&#xFC;hrer&#x2019;s death and took command of Germany. After the war ended, the Aviso Grille was taken to the United States and ended up in the hands of New Jersey shipyard owner Harry Doan, who illegally charged visitors 25 cents to board and tour Hitler&#x2019;s Yacht.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>In the early 1950s the yacht was scrapped in Doan&apos;s salvage yard, and when his friend Sam Carlani was in need of a toilet he gave him one of Hitler&apos;s, which included &quot;text written in Blackletter&#x2014;the famous and classically German family of typefaces that Hitler adored.&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the only piece of Nazi history in the Garden State, which is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905145255/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/honey_i_bought_hitlers_car.php">home to Hitler&apos;s car</a>. And now, for the completist, a short film titled: &quot;Hitler Goes To The Toilet&quot;...</p>
