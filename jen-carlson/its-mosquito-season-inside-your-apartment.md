title: It's Mosquito Season Inside Your Apartment
---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="smmsoqu0913.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smmsoqu0913.jpg" width="350" height="238"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Rendering</i></div> Hey guys, if you wake up with a bunch of bites on your body right now, DO NOT FREAK OUT. It&apos;s probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851/http://bedbugger.com/forum/topic/late-mosquito-season">not bed bugs</a>... more than likely the mosquitoes that were living outside of your apartment have now moved inside because it got too cold out there. <p></p>

<p>They&apos;re fragile, and your apartment is so warm and cozy. </p>

<p>So from now until the big chill comes and kills them all off for the winter: it&apos;s Mosquitoes Are Your New Roommates Season here in New York. It happens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851/http://brooklynian.com/forum/prospect-heights/mosquitoesim-still-getting-bit?postid=337778">every year</a>, and every year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851/http://brooklynian.com/forum/prospect-heights/mosquitos">someone starts a message board thread about it</a>. But <em>whatareyougonnado?</em> You can try the following, or just wait it out...</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851/http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/mosquito-repellants-for-the-ho-94556">Grow some basil</a>! It&apos;s a natural mosquito repellent and also tastes delicious to humans.
</li><li>Make sure your screens don&apos;t have holes in them if you are leaving your windows open
</li><li>Make sure there&apos;s no standing water in your apartment (like in your garbage can, you monster)
</li><li>Also check for standing water directly outside of your apartment.. maybe where your air conditioner has been leaking all summer.
</li><li>You could probably also get a mosquito net, though that seems a little extremist... but who says your extreme paranoia about contracting West Nile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851/http://www.amazon.com/Black-Corner-Canopy-Mosquito-Netting/dp/B005NJCS94/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380288876&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=mosquito+bed">can&apos;t be sexy</a>?</li></ul>

<p>The important thing here is that those bites on your legs are probably not from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bed bugs</a> (but like, maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183851/http://voices.yahoo.com/are-bed-bugs-lurking-apartment-6481434.html">check anyway</a>). Sleep tight!</p>
