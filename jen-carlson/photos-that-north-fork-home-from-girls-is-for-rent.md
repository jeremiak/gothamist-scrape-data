					<p>On Sunday&apos;s episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529025620/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a> the crew heads out to North Fork (&quot;it&apos;s for people who think the Hamptons are tacky and don&apos;t want to be on a beach that&apos;s near a J. Crew&quot;), where they drink <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529025620/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/17/last_nights_girls_dance.php">and dance</a> and laugh and lie... all within the confines of a gorgeous home. And it&apos;s with impeccable timing that a PR team has announced the house&#x2014;specifically located in East Marion&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529025620/http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p244982">is for rent</a>. </p>

<p>We are told by a rep for HomeAway that the &quot;Tower at Rocky Point is the perfect getaway for a group of your best friends. This large Long Island escape sits on a private three acre estate with 300 feet of private beach to supplement a 50 foot pool as well.  Perhaps the grandest feature is the five story tower breaching the top of the home, allowing for expansive views of the surrounding beach landscape.  Also, the living room has a 65-inch TV if you want to catch up on the latest episodes of <em>Girls</em>.&#x201D; What a truly special and mind-blowing experience that would be.</p>

<p>The rental will set you back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529025620/http://www.vrbo.com/246636#rates">$10,000/week</a> during the peak month of August, and before and after that ranges from $5,000 to $9,000 a week. However, if you fill it to capacity (13 people) during the off-season that means the nightly rate per person is only $54 a night. And of course, making life memories like this is priceless.</p>
