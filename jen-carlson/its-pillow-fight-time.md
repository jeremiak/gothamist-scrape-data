<p>There may be some snow showers this Saturday, but don&apos;t let that get in your way of good old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405203051/http://www.newmindspace.com/nycpillowfight.php">New York City pillow fight</a>! That&apos;s right, it&apos;s that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405203051/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/25/pillow_fight_in.php">special time of year</a> again when strangers pummel each other with pillows, leaving feathers to fly all over Union Square. </p>

<p>We&apos;re told &quot;there are over 10,000 people confirmed on Facebook! Last year there were only 1715 on Facebook and probably about 2,000 in real life.&quot; Will you be amongst the masses this year? We&apos;re guessing those in the secretive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405203051/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/11/pillowfight_clu.php">Pillow Fight Club in Bushwick</a> will be ready for battle, let&apos;s just hope they don&apos;t harbor any bricks in their pillowcases. </p>

<p>Show up at 3 p.m. <strong>this Saturday</strong> to get in on the action (and tag any photos you take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405203051/http://www.flickr.com/groups/gothamist/pool">with &quot;Gothamist&quot;</a> on Flickr). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405203051/http://www.newmindspace.com/nycpillowfight.php">More details here</a>.</p>
