<p>Rumors are being spread <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161340/http://www.refinery29.com/ryan-gosling-batman">via pageview-grabbing headlines</a> that Ryan Gosling might be the next Batman, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161340/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/batman_destined_to_return_again_and.php">the franchise gets rebooted</a> following the Christopher Nolan <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy. The rumor, however, quickly gets traced back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161340/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/27/christian-bale-leaving-batman-whos-next_n_1114960.html">this HuffPo piece</a>, which is just based in some fun with casting, and has no actual validity. <em>But it&apos;s too late</em>, the seed has been planted, and America needs Ryan Gosling to be the next caped crusader. In fact, if this doesn&apos;t end up becoming a reality, whoever <em>does</em> get cast as the next Batman is pretty much screwed and Hollywood might as well just set the Batcave on fire and bury it in a cemetery that Ryan Gosling can go visit with his girlfriend one day, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161340/http://www.denverpost.com/celebritybuzz/ci_19425666">that&apos;s how he rolls</a>.</p>

<p>Paging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161340/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/we-are-the-99">Buzzfeed</a>, can you start a petition or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161340/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/photosvideo_protesters_outside_of_p.php">protest</a> or something. Change! Hope! Etc!</p>
