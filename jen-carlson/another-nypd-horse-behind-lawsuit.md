There&apos;s another lawsuit against one of New York&apos;s finest... horses. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403055306/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/09/horse_suit.php">Last year</a> a New Jersey woman sued after being bit by one member of the force&apos;s furry fleet, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403055306/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cop_mounts_horse_suit_obcNYf2P3T4hur2tAkfgsM">the NY Post</a> reports that one of the NYPD&apos;s own is filing suit after being bucked off her horse.<p></p>

<p>Officer Tara Brzozowski, an NYPD Mounted Unit cop, claims her horse Kodiak isn&apos;t fit for the city streets. She says she was seriously injured when Kodiak tripped on a manhole cover, which tossed her off the saddle. And attention cyclists: this was while trotting along <em>a bike path</em> on 12th Avenue and 58th Street (though we suppose that&apos;s better than the NYPD using it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403055306/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/12/leading_by_example_cops_love_bike_l.php">as a parking lot</a>).</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed last week in Manhattan Supreme Court, says the horse isn&apos;t &quot;street qualified&quot; and the city should have never sent it out on patrol.</p>
