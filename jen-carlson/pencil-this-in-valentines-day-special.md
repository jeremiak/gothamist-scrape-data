Check out their inaugural exhibition whilst you nosh on fondue. The space is unique in that it will present &quot;regular programming of site-specific installations and special events...and during normal daytime hours, the space will be open to the public, and unmonitored.&quot; Suggested attire for the evening is red (well that&apos;s not very creative!).</p>

<p><em>6pm to midnight // Honey Space [148 11th Ave] // Free</em></p>

<p><strong>EVENT:</strong> The 2nd Annual Anti-Valentine&#x2019;s Day Ball at the Helmsley Hotel is the place to be for defiantly unsentimental singles fighting to take back February 14th from the tyranny of the Hallmark Corporation and and the FTD industrial complex. It starts at 7pm with an hour-long open bar; once everyone is properly lubricated, the evening progresses to dinner, dancing and cathartic festivities that include a photo-op to &#x201C;Make Exes Jealous with Your Own Personal Paparazzi and Model Entourage.&#xFFFD;? You&#x2019;re encouraged to immediately send the photo to your particular ex via cell phone, thereby proving you&#x2019;re totally, demonstrably <em>over it!</em> There will also be a Cupid-faced Satan ice sculpture, an opportunity to share break-up tales, shattered chocolate hearts and, what with all the jilted inebriated singles on hand, your best possible shot at some Anti-V Day rebound sex. &#x2013; <em>John Del Signore</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>7pm-10pm // New York Helmsley Hotel Ballroom [212 East 42nd St.] // Call (212) 405-4222 for reservations: $45 per person includes free hour of open bar and full menu. $75 for two (no couples).</em></p>
