<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128054016/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmyfallon">Jimmy Fallon</a> parodied <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128054016/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> and it was <em>perfect</em> stuff. Throughout the full <em>thirteen minutes</em> he outdoes himself at every turn, weaving in more and more nods to the show with real life parallels to his own career. A parody video rarely merits a &quot;spoiler alert,&quot; but this one is so intensely detailed that we don&apos;t even want to say any more. Watch the entire thing, because the quality doesn&apos;t dwindle as the vignette ages minute-to-minute&#x2014;it&apos;s good to the very end, and the end is pretty spectacular.</p>
