<p>A new government study is targeting our precious alcohol and has found that adults get nearly as many empty calories from the nectar of the gods as they do from soda... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806022748/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">NO ONE TELL BLOOMBERG</a>. This information isn&apos;t really shocking, of course, but it does have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806022748/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/health&amp;id=8886329">the AP asking</a>, &quot;Should New York officials now start cracking down on tall-boy beers and monster margaritas?&quot; <em>Shhhhhhh, AP, shhhhhhh.</em></p>

<p>Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says, &quot;In New York City, it was smart to start with sugary drinks. Let&apos;s see how it goes and then think about next steps.&quot; However, she notes the current system of only focusing on soda could be flawed&#x2014;&quot;the Obama administration is planning to exempt alcoholic beverages from proposed federal regulations requiring calorie labeling on restaurant menus... It could set up a confusing scenario in which, say, a raspberry iced tea may have a calorie count listed, while an alcohol-laden Long Island Iced Tea&#x2014;with more than four times as many calories&#x2014;doesn&apos;t.&quot; Our <em>own research</em>, based on common sense, shows that if you avoid novelty drinks like Long Island Iced Teas or anything served <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806022748/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/12/guy_fieris_times_square_restaurant.php#photo-5">at Guy Fieri&apos;s restaurant</a> then you&apos;ll be <em>just fine</em>.</p>

<p>So what did the study really find? Sweetened drinks like soda account for 6% of the calories adults consume on average, while alcoholic beverages account for about 5%. It also found that the average man consumes 150 calories, or one beer, per day, while the average woman drinks just 50 calories a day (that&apos;s about half a glass of wine). Half a glass of wine&#x2014;what kind of teetotaling pool did they get <em>these</em> participants from?</p>
