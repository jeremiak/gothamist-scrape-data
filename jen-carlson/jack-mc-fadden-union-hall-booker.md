As most good things in New York, everyone seemed to find out about this gem in no time, leading to crowded bocce courts and limited seating on weekends. On most nights, however, the sirens still draw us there. Jack McFadden (affectionately called Skippy by those who know him), books the downstairs venue, which has consistently had solid lineups. We recently asked him about how he makes the magic happen there...</p>

<p><strong>Since opening last July, how have you seen Union Hall change?</strong><br>
I think, not unlike any new venue opening in NYC, there&apos;s a honeymoon period.  Our crowds were amazingly diverse for the first six months, dare I say, B&amp;T; types, but I think we&apos;re getting more of the locals who may have been scared off initially by the big crowds.  Part of that could be the fun programming downstairs and the friendly hospitality from everyone who works there, it&apos;s a welcoming place.  Andy, one of our owners, is always coming up with something really cool to build in there, too.  He&apos;s always surprising us and the customers and bands too.</p>

<p><strong>As the booker at the venue, you&apos;ve managed to get some pretty big names on the small stage there - tell us about one of your favorite shows involving one of the big names...</strong><br>
Yeah, it always floors me when a band big enough to sell out Bowery or Irving decides to play a special show at Union Hall.  I think one of the most wonderful nights was a sleepy Sunday night back in January this year.  It was a mild winter up until that night and it was supposed to snow finally.  By chance, Peter Bjorn and John were going to play their first ever U.S. show here, at Union Hall, and it started to get to me during soundcheck, how special the night would be.  The windows of the bar upstairs started getting foggy, and I went out to the patio to take a deep breath and saw 3 or 4 people sharing a big bottle of red wine at a table, OUTSIDE....as the snow started coming down.  Everyone was just in a fantastic mood and the show was magic.  I think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070005/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/05/16/andrew_bird_musician.php">Andrew Bird</a> playing here recently was a dream come true, too, we&apos;re very lucky sometimes.</p>
