                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:233px; "> <img alt="php9L55NmAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901165822im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php9L55NmAM.jpg" width="233" height="350"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo of Gingko Tree at BBG by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901165822/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/477522296/">Wally G</a></span></i></div> Seeing as how it takes the Parks Dept. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901165822/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/15/more_trees_more_problems.php">3 to 5 years</a> to deal with tree problems, it&apos;s unlikely that Bay Ridge resident Richard Mahany will get the gingko tree that&apos;s stinking up his neighborhood removed any time soon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901165822/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/42/32_42_bm_stinky_gingko_tree.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that the man is angry that the tree &quot;dumps its foul-smelling fruit on the sidewalk in front of his 78th Street home.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The 74-year-old says the gingko is a &quot;menace,&quot; and (probably whilst shaking his fist in the air) declared: &#x201C;If the city can refuse to remove the tree, then I can refuse to clean up the mess &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a city tree!&#x201D; He&apos;s cleaned up after it for 40 years, but after having quintuple bypass surgery he understandably doesn&apos;t have the energy anymore. So the gingko is shedding its odorous fruit onto the sidewalk, which allegedly produce a vomitous odor that goes all the way down 5th Avenue.</p>

<p>Parks Department spokesman Phil Abramson told the paper they stopped planting female gingko trees (males don&apos;t smell) after complaints, however they are under no obligation to help out residents who have ended up with one, and it&apos;s the responsibility of the homeowner to clean up after it. The homeowner, Mahoney says, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I love trees. I&#x2019;m willing to pay for another tree - I just don&#x2019;t have the energy to keep cleaning this up.&#x201D; Since the tree is healthy, it looks like residents are stuck with it for a while... but consider it on arboricide watch!</p>
