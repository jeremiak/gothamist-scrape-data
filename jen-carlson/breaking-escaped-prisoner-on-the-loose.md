Here&apos;s the recap so far (we&apos;ll update as we get more information): </p>

<p>Around 2:30 p.m. word came in that an escaped prisoner&apos;s (getaway) vehicle was located in Ridgefield, NJ&#x2014;while it didn&apos;t contain the prisoner, it did contain his shackles! They believe the perp&#x2014;who escaped US Marshals Custody in Fort Lee&#x2014;may have an NYPD radio, and yadda yadda yadda he&apos;s now on a NJ Transit Bus headed towards NYC! The fugitive is 5&apos;8&quot; tall, hispanic, male and clean-shaven.... &quot;possibly with one handcuff still on his wrist.&quot; </p>

<p>All buses entering NYC are now being stopped and searched, and all drivers of those buses are being notified of the situation.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807152000/http://www.cliffviewpilot.com/bergen/1842-manhunt-on-for-escapee-from-nypd-us-marshals">Cliffview Pilot</a>, authorities have closed off a Palisades Park neighborhood at around 4 p.m. and one source says the prisoner &quot;may be holed up in a building on East Brinkerhoff Avenue off Broad Avenue, less than a block from a First Street school.&quot;</p>
