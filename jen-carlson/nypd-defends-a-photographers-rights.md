When the tourist stood up for his rights, the man got &quot;slightly physical&quot; and drew the argument out. The tourist found two NYPD officers to ask them the rules, &quot;and was shockingly told that it was legal. In fact, the officers even walked downstairs with him and informed the man that photography was indeed legal.&quot; Score one for photographers, seems some in the NYPD actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602112141/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/nypd_get_lesson_in_photography.php">got the memo</a>!<p></p>
