</p><p>Sure, &quot;citizen encyclopediaism&quot; isn&apos;t a real term, but either was &quot;citizen journalism&quot; at some point, and with Wikipedia...anything can be fact, and anyone can author an encyclopedia entry. Sure the facts are sometimes...totally false, but c&apos;mon, even the Encyclopedia Britannica got Stalin&#x2019;s birth date and the birth name of Bill Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012406/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Britannica_errors">wrong</a>.</p>

<p>On Monday night&apos;s <em>Colbert Report</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012406/http://spring.newsvine.com/_news/2006/08/01/307864-stephen-colbert-causes-chaos-on-wikipedia-gets-blocked-from-site">the defender of truth himself praised Wikipedia for &quot;wikiality&quot;</a>, &quot;the reality that exists if you make something up and enough people agree with you&quot;. He urged viewers to &quot;find the Wikipedia entry on elephants and create an entry that stated their population had tripled in the last six months, a fact he freely stated to not know if it was &quot;actually true,&quot; with his sidebar stating &quot;it isn&apos;t.&quot; (See above clip from the show.)</p>

<p>Colbert has now been blocked from using the site. Though <a href="&lt;a href=" http:="" en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" user_talk:stephencolbert"="">the site states</a>, &quot;This is being done to protect the actual Stephen Colbert from impersonation&quot;, one of the site admin&apos;s blogs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012406/http://tawker.com/2006/08/01/i-blocked-stephen-colbert-on-wikipedia/">states</a>, &quot;Yes, I am Wikipedia Tawker and yes, I blocked. That &#x201C;joke&#x201D; used way too much of my bandwidth, my poor Tawkerbot4 couldn&#x2019;t keep up! In all, we ended up protecting 20 elephant related pages.&quot; He also adds, &quot;Now, if Stephen Colbert is out there, I&#x2019;m willing to appear on the show if you put me on report. I need one round trip airfare to New York for the taping but just give me a date and I&#x2019;ll go.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012406/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_stunts">Of course you will</a>. </p>

<p>The New Yorker recently published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012406/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060731fa_fact">an article</a> titled, &quot;Know It All: Can Wikepedia conquer expertise?&quot; mentioning the survey published by <em>Nature</em> which showed Wikipedia having four errors for every three of Britannica&#x2019;s. We imagine that number is up now, especially with all those elephant entries. </p>
