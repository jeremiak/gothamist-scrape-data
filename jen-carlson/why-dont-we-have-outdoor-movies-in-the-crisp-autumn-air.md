We&apos;d like it very much if there were outdoor movies in the fall.<p></p>

<p>Nobody freak out&#x2014;you can still have your outdoor movies in the summer. No one will take those away from those of you who enjoy sitting on a crowded lawn with sweaty people and the humidity smothering you like a warm, moist blanket as you watch <em>Breakfast At Tiffanys</em>. Don&apos;t you worry about that. That&apos;s going to happen next summer and forever. We&apos;re just proposing that there be a fall outdoor movie series as well. Why should Summer People have all the fun?</p>

<p>Think about it: sipping on your Pumpkin Spice Latte (and hey, maybe put a little rum in there? It&apos;s AUTUMN, time to feel alive)... and there you are, sitting on your fleece blanket with your flannel-clad boyfriend who has made his seasonal transition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506170336/http://www.theonion.com/articles/mr-autumn-man-walking-down-street-with-cup-of-coff,29866/?ref=auto">into Mr. Autumn</a>. He&apos;s hugging you, but not in that suffocating way that typically makes you want to run very fast in the other direction because <em>god he just loves you too much it&apos;s weird</em>... just in a sweet way that takes the slight chill away from the air. And as you melt into the warmth of his body, you realize this is the best time you&apos;ve ever had watching <em>Nightmare On Elm Street</em>. And it&apos;s funny, isn&apos;t it, how in this golden Autumn light he looks a bit like Ryan Gosling in <em>The Notebook</em>? Also it was <em>so nice</em> of your friend Peggy to bring that Maple-Crusted Squash-Thyme Casserole, which will pair perfectly with that Thermos of robust red wine you brought. You wonder why you guys don&apos;t all hang out that often anymore, and decide to change that.</p>

<p>Hey, is that a random stranger handing out candy apples in the distance? Man, this weather really puts people in a good mood. Kind of makes you wonder why every outdoor movies series in NYC is held during the hottest, most humid months of the year...</p>
