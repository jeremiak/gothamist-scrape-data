Hopefully they&apos;ve worked out some kinks in the past year, because the 2nd one-night-only, all-night open house party is coming up on September 27th.</p>

<p>The music this year is curated by Sufjan Stevens and includes performances by St. Vincent, The Budos Band, Naomi Shelton &amp; The Gospel Queens, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus singing Nico Muhly and other works. Off stage, here&apos;s a little bit more of what you can look forward to.</p><blockquote>Films curated by the critically-acclaimed BAMcin&#xE9;matek including Lars von Trier&apos;s supernatural thriller The Kingdom, a snap-shot of Brooklyn&#x2019;s colorful past, a mix-tape of 1985 cinematic &#x2018;gems,&#x2019; and a celebration of beer in film; DJ sets from King Britt and Vikter Duplaix; video art by Deborah Johnson, CandyStations; and a Rec Room lounge with Wii, Guitar Hero, ping-pong, and arcade games; and $3 beer.</blockquote>The all-nighter goes from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. and $20 tickets are on sale now, for those who don&apos;t mind surrendering their personal space for a few hours.<p></p>
