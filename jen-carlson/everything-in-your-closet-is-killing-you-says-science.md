<p>As if you weren&apos;t destroying your body enough by simply <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041051/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/29/the_truth_about_sitting_down_its_ki.php"><em>sitting</em> all day</a>, are you really going to go ahead and wear those tight jeans while you do it? A few years ago, the dangers of skinny jeans were brought up when the <em>Today</em> show did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041051/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/16/video_1.php">a segment</a> on &quot;tingling thigh syndrome,&quot; and gave a whole new meaning to the term &quot;fashion victim.&quot; Well it turns out, unsurprisingly, that skinny jeans aren&apos;t the only thing in your closet that can damage your body. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041051/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204909104577235313412770808.html?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_5">Wall Street Journal</a>, so can belts, neck ties, body shapers like Spanx, shoes (including flip flops), bike shorts, and <em>everything</em>. But this doesn&apos;t mean you have to join a nudist colony&#x2014;just be a little looser when you get dressed in the morning, or try to get your office to institute a Casual Sweatpants Friday.</p>

<p>One Brooklyn woman told the WSJ that she had numbness in her leg, and after some testing, the neurologist determined it was from her tight belts. He told her &quot;they can compress a major nerve, the lateral, femoral cutaneous nerve, that runs from the abdomen to the outer thigh... Anything that puts pressure on that nerve can cause it. It&apos;s very, very common.&quot; If you feel any numbness in your body, your best bet is to head to the neurologist.</p>

<p>Men aren&apos;t safe, either. Tight shirt collars and ties can cause &quot;headaches, blurred vision or tingling around the ears... [and] can reduce circulation to the brain and increase intraocular pressure, a risk factor for glaucoma, experts warn. Tight ties can also decrease range of motion in the neck and increase muscle tension in the back and shoulders.&quot; In other words, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509041051/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/hipster_cop_i_will_reveal_that_i_we.php#photo-1">Hipster Cop is screwed</a>.</p>
