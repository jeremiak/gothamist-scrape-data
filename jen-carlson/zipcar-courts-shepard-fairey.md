<p>Seems the company is smitten with his piece that resides on a wall in their new Hope Street and Marcy Avenue lot in Brooklyn (pictured), and hint at wanting to partner up. They write:</p><blockquote>Check out this latest from famed graffiti artist Shepard Fairey. Rumor has it, he&apos;s also a Zipcar member. This amazing wall art can be seen at one of our newest lots at Hope St &amp; Marcy Ave in Brooklyn.<p></p>

<p>While we&apos;re on the subject, a side note for Mr. Fairey himself: Shepard, we have a proposition for you. If you are interested in hearing it, email Ryan. Oh, the intrigue!</p></blockquote>Will all of Zipcar&apos;s lots soon be adorned with Fairey&apos;s work?<p></p>
