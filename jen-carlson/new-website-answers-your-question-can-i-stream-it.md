<p>At last, a website that can tell you what you can stream online, aptly called: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200137/http://www.canistream.it/">Can I Stream It?</a> It&apos;s especially handy for those who use multiple websites for their television and movie intake (like a Roku user), and aggregates all of the offerings from Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon (it also includes options on where to purchase the title, from outlets like iTunes). No one wants to check all of those &quot;channels&quot; to find out if they can watch <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, so this is a real time saver. Less typing, more sloth.</p>

<p>Bonus: &quot;if the movie you&apos;re looking for is not available, just sign-up, set a reminder and viola we will shoot you an email when your chosen service makes the movie available.&quot; And the service is free... for now.
