title: Hole Will Reunite At MoMA... For A Q&A;
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215633/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> may have been touring around with her band Hole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215633/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/26/hole_in_nyc_billy_corgan_takes_down.php">recently</a>, but her band was severely different from the original lineup. On Monday the original four will band together again, however, for a screening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215633/http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/film_screenings/12189"><em>Hit So Hard</em></a> at MoMA&#x2014;a documentary about former Hole drummer Patty Schemel (clip below).</p>

<p>Courtney Love, Eric Erlandson, Patty Schemel, and Melissa Auf der Maur are all scheduled to be present, along with filmmaker David Ebersole, for a Q&amp;A.; This is allegedly &quot;the first time these four musicians have been together at a public event in 13 years.&quot; The band officially broke up in 2002, and when Love announced the reunion in 2009 it came as a surprise to the original members. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215633/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/relive-through-this-a-hole-reunion-of-sorts-at-new-directorsnew-films/">Arts Beat</a> recalls that Erlandson&apos;s response was, &#x201C;there is no Hole without me,&quot; to which Love declared, &#x201C;MY Band. MY name.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s okay if you&apos;re embracing your inner teen-angst-ridden fan girl right now and hoping they bring instruments.</p>
