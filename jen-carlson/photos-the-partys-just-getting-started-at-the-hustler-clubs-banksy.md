                            <p>We&apos;re on the scene of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208080756/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/banksys_new_piece.php">today&apos;s new Banksy</a>, which went up on the side of the Hustler Club on West 51st and 12th. Stay tuned for updates tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Hustler Club&apos;s spokesperson told us earlier that they plan to remove the gate at some point, and will possibly display it inside the club. The club was scheduled to open at 6 p.m. tonight, but so far they&apos;re keeping the gate down.</p>
