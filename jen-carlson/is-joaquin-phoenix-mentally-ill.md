										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="php3v8DbyPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175302im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php3v8DbyPM.jpg" width="88" height="130" class="image-right"> </span>The debate about Joaquin Phoenix&apos;s strange behavior as of late <em>continues</em>. Refusing to believe it&apos;s a hoax, despite a camera crew following him around for a documentary, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175302/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2009/02/is-joaquin-phoe.html">LA Times</a> is going down the mentally ill route. So far the most talked about display of his new bearded, mumbling persona has been from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175302/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/12/joaquin_phoenix_on_letterman.php">appearance on Letterman</a> (which just re-aired last night). The psychiatrist the paper talked to said &quot;much of Phoenix&apos;s behavior on Letterman hinted at mental illness, such as wearing sunglasses, which may suggest paranoia. &apos;There is something wrong. And it&apos;s beyond drug abuse.&apos; The public should refrain from mocking Phoenix.&quot; So basically he&apos;s like 0% crazy, 80% beard and 20% sunglasses. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175302/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1606014/20090227/story.jhtml">MTV News</a> asked Phoenix&apos;s publicist about the Doc&apos;s diagnosis, which she labeled: &quot;wildly inappropriate.&quot;</p>
