Alas, we live too far away from a beach to wake up at 5am and check the local surf report (please note: taking the F train to surf was not a part of the dream)...so the closest we ever got was watching Kate Bosworth&apos;s breakout film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300532/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9b258ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9Ymx1ZSBjcnVzaHxodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=20"><em>Blue Crush</em></a>. </p>

<p>Moving on, on May 26th (that&apos;s tomorrow!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.freshpaved.com/Static_Pages/newbstylesession_page.html">Style Sessions</a> begins a nine-day art exhibit (through June 3rd) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.milkstudios.com/index_mac.html">Milk Gallery</a> [400 W 15th St at 10th Ave] with an opening reception and silent auction to benefit breast cancer awareness.  A portion of proceeds from art sales go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.b4bc.org/">Boarding for Breast Cancer</a> (B4BC). Partnered with Skull Skates and renowned artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.quigleyart.com/">William Quigley</a>, 75 original art works on skateboard decks were created.  The exhibit includes contributions from Dogtown legend Tony Alva, artist and the NY Times declared &quot;anti-Hilton sister&quot; Hope Atherton, 50 Cent and and Robin Williams.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, or not, on June 3rd the movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/lordsofdogtown/"><em>Lords of Dogtown</em></a> will hit theaters. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.b4bc.org/feature/1.php">The Lords of Dogtown Art Tour</a>, consisting of more than 60 pieces of artwork, joins the Style Sessions Exhibit from May 31 &#x2013; June 3 at the very same Milk Gallery. Select pieces from the tour are also being auctioned to raise additional money for Boarding for Breast Cancer.  </p>

<p>Related: On May 28th, Style Sessions hosts a free-ride skateboard and photo competition where riders are judged in a surf style format.  Best Rider receives a free trip to the Tokyo Style Sessions in the fall of 2005.  Best Photographer receives $1,000 in printing and digital imaging services courtesy of Sumo Graphics along with publication in several magazines including Concrete Wave. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.freshpaved.com/Static_Pages/newbstylesession_page.html">Details here</a>.</p>

<p>We are totally going to practice on our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726184314/http://www.indoboard.com/skaters.html">Indo Board</a> for the next three days. </p>
