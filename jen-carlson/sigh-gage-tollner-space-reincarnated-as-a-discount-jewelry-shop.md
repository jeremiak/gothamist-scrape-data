<p>The landmarked space that used to house Gage &amp; Tollner on Fulton Street has been inhabited by some less-classic joints in the recent past, and with every reopening, it gets worse. Most recently it was a T.G.I. Friday&#x2019;s, followed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133209/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/13/arbys.php">an Arby&apos;s</a> (that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133209/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/arbys_4.php">closed after 7 months</a>), and now: a discount jewelery store.</p>

<p>The way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133209/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/29/dtg_arbysreplaced_2011_07_22_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> describes the discount jewelry chain, it sounds like Claire&apos;s boutique (everyone had those in their malls, right?). The shop, called Ladies &amp; Gents, just opened on Sunday, and apparently they&apos;re doing very well, so way to go Brooklyn. Maybe it&apos;s all the track lighting and wall panels they covered the original decor up with. </p>

<p>At least the space was revived to its original glory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509133209/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/boardwalk_empire_filming_at_gage_to.php">earlier this year</a> when <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> shot there. Stay tuned for a look at that when the show returns to the air later this year.</p>
