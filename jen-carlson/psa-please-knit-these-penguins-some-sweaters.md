<p>New York knitting community: you are needed. The New Zealand oil spill has left cute, little penguins in need of warmth and protection. A call has been put out for knitters to make penguin sweaters. Yes, PENGUIN SWEATERS. Undoubtedly, the most adorable thing you&apos;ll hear all week. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522043940/http://www.grist.org/list/2011-10-18-you-know-you-want-to-knit-a-sweater-for-a-penguin">to Grist</a>, a yarn store has even posted patterns for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522043940/http://www.skeinz.com/Newsletters/spring2011.html">how to knit &quot;penguin jumpers&quot;</a> (hold up, penguin <em>jumpers</em> is now the most adorable thing you&apos;ll hear all week), and they&apos;ve included where the finished products can be sent.</p>

<p>The request (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522043940/http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/penguins.asp">which is really really real</a>), isn&apos;t the first of its kind, and Grist notes that &quot;the woolens keep oil-soaked birds warm until they&apos;re well enough to be cleaned, and prevent them from nibbling oil off their feathers.&quot;</p>

<p>And now: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522043940/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=penguin+sweaters&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=486l3037l0l3104l18l12l1l2l3l0l197l1014l8.3l13l0&amp;um=1&amp;authuser=0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1666&amp;bih=787&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=ni#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=penguins+in+sweaters&amp;oq=penguins+in+sweaters&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=1654l4238l4l4389l8l6l0l5l5l0l290l290l2-1l1l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;fp=e7b2a7a36b299bca&amp;biw=1666&amp;bih=787">how you&apos;ll spend the rest of your day</a>.</p>
