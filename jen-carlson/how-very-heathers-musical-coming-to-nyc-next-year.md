<p>Lunchtime poll: If you had to see one teen angst-driven film hit the Off-Broadway stage, which would it be? As with many things in life, you actually do not have a choice. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095133/http://www.heathersthemusical.com/">It&apos;s <em>Heathers</em></a>. </p>

<p>Following a premiere engagement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095133/http://laist.com/2013/08/30/heathers_the_new_musical.php&quot;">in Los Angeles</a>, the musical stage adaptation of the late-&apos;80s classic will have an Off-Broadway run at New World Stages (340 West 50th Street) starting in March 2014, and tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095133/http://groups.telecharge.com/shows/show_Page.aspx?PID=10128">on sale now</a> (note: the run sold out in LA). <br>
 <br>
The musical actually has its roots at Joe&apos;s Pub, where a couple of early versions of the show were performed by Laurence O&apos;Keefe and Kevin Murphy (who have adapted the movie for stage) in 2010.</p>
