While everyone else was welcoming 2008 with friends and family, the Yemen native&apos;s wife and baby were still living a world away, so Waleed Alsaidi bought himself a little present at his family&apos;s deli in Harlem to pass time on the lonely shift.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308185203/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01182008/news/regionalnews/the_10m_deli_man_899707.htm">The NY Post</a> reports on the feel-good story, which happily ended with Alsaidi getting the largest payout in New York scratch-off history! Happy New Year, indeed. He picked up his big check at Castle Clinton in Battery Park yesterday, and told those in attendance that he hadn&apos;t let his wife know yet, and wanted to surprise her with the news when he visited.  </p>

<p>The $20 ticket earns him $10,000 per week for the rest of his life, which comes to about $6,450 after taxes. He says &quot;I&apos;m going to start living good,&quot; and after the visit to his wife and baby, he will try to bring them and other relatives to the U.S. </p>

<p>The Post points out that &quot;if he lives to be more than 100, his winnings will be nearly $40 million, before taxes.&quot;</p>
