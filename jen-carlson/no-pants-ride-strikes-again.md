</div></div>					<p>Over 1200 folks showed up for the 8th annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108174349/http://improveverywhere.com/2009/01/10/no-pants-2k9-nyc-reports/">No Pants Ride</a> yesterday. The group split up and took over four separate train lines, where they terrified children, delighted perverts, shocked prudes, and brought some humor underground. If you think the troupe was warm, however, check out the photos&#x2014;those pants didn&apos;t come on above ground, in the freezing snowy weather! Did you spot the knickerless masses yesterday? </p>

<p>When asked about police presence, Improv Everywhere founder Charlie Todd said there was &quot;None at all.  Unlike the last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108174349/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/14/another_sign_it.php">two</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108174349/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/13/no_pants_day_20.php">years</a> they weren&apos;t even there to escort us.  Totally hands off.&quot;  There don&apos;t seem to be any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108174349/http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/mis?query=no+pants&amp;minAsk=min&amp;maxAsk=max">Missed Connections</a> (yet) either, but some Improv Everywhere agents reported back from the front lines. One heard an onlooker openly declare: &quot;<strong>This is why I go on the subway; this would never happen on the bus.</strong>&quot; While another was asked &#x201C;<strong>Are you guys protesting Madoff?</strong>&#x201D;</p>
