<p>The NYPL has a fantastic team of book recommenders (maybe you&apos;ve seen them in their <em>Peanuts</em>-esque booth around town), and we recently challenged them to make us some lists. Below, the Readers Services librarians give us their recommendations for novels set in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213634/http://gothamist.com/tags/1980">1980s NYC</a>, a time, they note, when &quot;Times Square was gritty and Wall Street was on the rise, New York City was the perfect spot to set a work of fiction. Everything was changing; the past and present were racing toward the future with the speed of a coke-addled yuppie. Hair was high, suits were powerful, and books were written by white guys who all hung out together.&quot;</p>

Wolfe&#x2019;s quintessential &#x2019;80s novel is practically a manual on the greed, rampant ambition, and gross consumerism of the decade.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213634/http://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb17730919__SBright%20Lights%2C%20Big%20City__Orightresult__U__X7?lang=eng&amp;suite=def"><strong>Bright Lights, Big City</strong></a> by Jay McInerney<br>
&quot;Each generation needs its Manhattan novel, and many ache to write it. But it was McInerney who succeeded.&quot; &#x2014;The New York Times Book Review</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213634/http://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb17832304__SVeronica__P0%2C1__Orightresult__U__X7?lang=eng&amp;suite=def"><strong>Veronica</strong></a> by Mary Gaitskill<br>
Two women&#x2014;a glamorous fashion model and an HIV-positive cynic&#x2014;meet in 1980s New York, and their narrative shifts between past and present on a journey of friendship, discovery, and loss.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213634/http://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb18632456__St%3A%28angels%20america%20%29%20a%3A%28kushner%29__Orightresult__U__X2?lang=eng&amp;suite=def"><strong>Angels in America</strong></a> by Tony Kushner<br>
A sweeping play about the terrifying beginnings of the AIDS epidemic.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213634/http://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/search/C__St%3A%28American%20Psycho%29%20a%3A%28ellis%29__Orightresult__U?lang=eng&amp;suite=def"><strong>American Psycho</strong></a> by Brett Easton Ellis<br>
Ellis plunges readers into the mind of serial killer/investment banker Patrick Bateman and the high-gloss, morally bankrupt world of 1980s Wall Street.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213634/http://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb19668922__SSister%20Outsider%20__Orightresult__U__X7?lang=eng&amp;suite=def"><strong>Sister Outsider</strong></a> by Audre Lorde (1984)<br>
In this collection of essays and speeches, Lorde addresses sexism, racism, black lesbians, and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213634/http://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/search/C__St%3A%28sag%20harbor%29%20a%3A%28colson%20whitehead%29__Orightresult__U?lang=eng&amp;suite=def"><strong>Sag Harbor</strong></a> by Colson Whitehead<br>
Set against a ritzy Hamptons backdrop, this coming-of-age story about two wealthy, teenaged, African-American brothers living on their own for a summer in the &#x2019;80s echoes some of Whitehead&#x2019;s own experiences.</p>
