Construction workers there uncovered a historic concrete bulkhead, which is actually on the State Register of Historic Places (this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151321/http://goingcoastal.wordpress.com/2008/05/27/exposing-the-wall-between-the-river-and-new-york-city/">wasn&apos;t the first time</a> a part of the wall has been exposed). It was put in place over 100 years ago when Civil War Gen. George McClellan launched the project &quot;because silt and refuse was building up along the Hudson River shoreline and rotting piers, preventing ships from landing.&quot; Historic archeologist Joe Sopko allowed the workers to remove part of the slab, noting: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just concrete.&quot; However, he points out it was one of the first examples of a large amount of concrete used in a construction project.
