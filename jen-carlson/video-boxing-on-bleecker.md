										<p>Ah, springtime in the city. One local recently stepped out of a coffee shop to find these two hooligans boxing on the corner of Bleeker Street and 6th Avenue. Spoiler alert: expect one good punch, a racial slur, and a spit shot... but surprisingly it didn&apos;t escalate beyond that. Have NYC street fights even gotten soft?</p>
