</div></div>					<p>Happy Birthday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323231204/http://gothamist.com/tags/washingtonsquarepark">Washington Square Park</a> Arch! The structure, designed by architect Stanford White and built between 1890-1892, turns 115 today&#x2014;while it was basically complete by 1892, it wasn&apos;t officially unveiled until 1895 when New York governor Levi P. Morton paraded down 5th Avenue to present it to a crowd of New Yorkers. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323231204/http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2010/05/washington-square-arch-turns-115-today.html">Inside the Apple</a>, the arch was actually built <em>twice</em>, &quot;the first one was made of wood, plaster, and papier-m&#xE2;ch&#xE9; and erected on Fifth Avenue just north of Washington Square in 1889 as a part of the festivities in honor of the centennial of George Washington&apos;s inaugural.&quot; After the festivities were over, a fundraising committee was formed and a permanent, marble replacement was put in place.</p>

<p>Around the time the second arch was complete marked the beginning of the City Beautiful movement and the formation of the Municipal Art Society, whose motto was (according to this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323231204/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C03EFDC1031E033A25753C2A9629C94629ED7CF">1893 NY Times article</a>), &quot;To make  us love our country, we should make our country lovely.&quot; Check out some more photos of the arch&apos;s past at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323231204/http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GV/GV046WashingtonSquareArch.htm">NYC Architecture</a>. Today the history of the park still pops up from time to time, most recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323231204/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/12/mysterious_wsp_gravestone_becomes_l.php">a tombstone from 1799</a> was unearthed from when the area was a potter&apos;s field.</p>
