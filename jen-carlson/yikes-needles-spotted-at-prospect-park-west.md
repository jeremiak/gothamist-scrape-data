<p>No <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811130759/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/prospect_park_2.php">dead animals</a> spotted in Prospect Park today (but the day is young!), however, a reader just sent over this photo taken nearby, at 7:30 a.m., of many, <em>many</em> needles spattered about the sidewalk on 17th and Prospect Park West (we&apos;re told &quot;that corner is frequently used for drug deals with very little police presence,&quot; and there&apos;s a &quot;very active, yet quiet of late, crack house 3 doors down from the spot where the photo was taken&quot;). The NYPD and Sanitation Department are on top of it, but, as of an hour ago, were still looking for stray needles. They don&apos;t exactly look clean, and we&apos;re told some were dirty and had the caps off; after a toddler was just pricked with a needle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811130759/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/22/toddler_pricked_with_dirty_needle_a.php">containing the HIV virus</a>... well, better keep your kids in the Bugaboo if you&apos;re in the area today.</p>
