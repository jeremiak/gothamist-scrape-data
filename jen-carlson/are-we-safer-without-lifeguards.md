										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="0809beachlifeguard.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713031742im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0809beachlifeguard.jpg" width="350" height="305"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713031742/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ascord04/2984860080/">ascord04&apos;s flickr</a></span></i></div> It&apos;s sort of fitting that with our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713031742/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/10/are_your_children_safe_from_sand.php">death sand</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713031742/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/30/beach_report.php">polluted water</a> that our city&apos;s beach lifeguards are probably drunk and under-trained. Going to the beach is now just as adventurous as going to Tompkins Square Park after midnight in the 80s&#x2014;danger lurking around every corner and no one there to save you! Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713031742/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08072009/news/regionalnews/trouble_brews_183404.htm">the NY Post</a> is reporting on the sad state of affairs, saying the Parks Department has launched an investigation into beer drinking at the Orchard Beach lifeguard office; which comes on the heels of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713031742/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/03/rockaway_lifeguard_caught_with_ipod.php">the Rockaway iPod lifeguard</a> incident. <p></p>

<p>Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe commented on the imbibing guards, after photos of Bud Light Lime cases stacked outside their office were printed, saying, &quot;Everyone&apos;s entitled to have a beer after work but certainly not on the park grounds.&quot;</p>

<p>While he said no serious problems plagued the city&apos;s lifeguard program, it has been called out in the past for having loose standards and a lax training program (which all-in-all is 40 hours, in comparison to other city&apos;s which are 61 hours). One former lifeguard who quit last year, told the Post, &quot;A good percentage are failing the [city&apos;s] test, but they get put on the beach.&quot; We need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140713031742/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/25/superhero_surfe.php">the superhero surfer</a> to come back and install a new training program.</p>
