<p>A tipster sent in this video that he took on New Year&apos;s night, January 1st, around midnight. The scene takes place on Elizabeth and Kenmare in Manhattan, and the guy who recorded it tells us that the &quot;entitled hipsters got pissed at the &apos;off duty&apos; light&quot; and kicked off the cab driver&apos;s right side mirror after having some words with him. </p>

<p>At the 1:30 mark, after the would-be passengers finally walk away, the cab driver (mirror in hand) walks after them... maybe to get their information since they just tore the mirror off his car? They immediately attack him even though the cab driver doesn&apos;t appear to be fighting back&#x2014;the first guy actually tries to running-punch the driver, but misses and flies into a gate (around the 1:32 mark). Sadly, there&apos;s not really a clear shot of their faces.</p>
