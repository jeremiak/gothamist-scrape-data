<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150108/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/18/new_years_9_has_arrived.php">mentioned yesterday</a>, the New Year&apos;s Eve 2009 sign is being powered with a little help from Times Square visitors. The Duracell Power Lodge has been set up to accommodate snowmobiles, that are really stationary bikes with a snowmobile shell around them. When passerby pedal the snowmobikes, it will generate electricity that will in turn be stored to help power the lights on their big night.</p>

<p>Where can you go to lend some pedal power? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150108/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Duracell-Invites-Consumers-Power-New/story.aspx?guid=%7B98175877-7EFD-4A29-88DE-209568B084D5%7D">Duracell Power Lodge</a> is right by the Charmin restrooms at 1540 Broadway (between 45th &amp; 46th Streets), probably somewhere near the 3 Musketeers Confetti Wishing Wall. Oh c&apos;mon, like you didn&apos;t know Times Square was powered by advertisements.</p>
