<p>Tonight at the big 12.12.12 concert at MSG (which benefits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130903020321/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> victims), the remaining members of Nirvana will take the stage with a new frontman: Paul McCartney. WHAT IS HAPPENING?</p>

<p>Headlines are appearing all over the internet that make us feel confused, like we&apos;re living in some weird manufactured future that can&apos;t possibly be real&#x2014;one reads: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130903020321/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/dec/12/paul-mccartney-kurt-cobain-nirvana">Paul McCartney to replace Kurt Cobain in Nirvana reunion</a>.&quot; Listen, we love Macca, but please just <em>really</em> think about that for a minute... while imagining the former Beatle singing this song: </p>

<p>Or how about this one?</p>

<p>Really, just picture Sir McCartney singing <em>any Nirvana song</em>. It is NOT NATURAL. But here we are, the end of the world is right around the corner, nothing is sacred, and the gods are hurling down locusts in the form of terrible music collaborations. Somewhere, Lindsay Lohan and Skrillex are in talks to replace Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham in a new formation of Fleetwood Mac.</p>

<p>So how did this happen? At some point, Dave Grohl asked McCartney to come &quot;jam with some mates&quot;&#x2014;himself, Krist Novoselic, and Pat Smear&#x2014;and so he did. The jam session will now be brought to MSG, where they promise at least one new original song. While recalling the formation of this Mutant Nirvana, McCartney admitted: &quot;I didn&apos;t really know who they were. They are saying how good it is to be back together. I said: &apos;Whoa? You guys haven&apos;t played together for all that time?&apos; And somebody whispered to me: <strong>&apos;That&apos;s Nirvana. You&apos;re Kurt.&apos;</strong>&quot; One source tells us it was Satan himself who whispered that. </p>
