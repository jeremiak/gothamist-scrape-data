<p>A reader sent us these photos of a man selling a live shark at 1 a.m. on J train recently, telling us the guy was &quot;calling out his product like he was a retro cigarette girl. He said he caught it at Coney Island after &apos;it bit me in the ass.&apos; I told him I&apos;m pretty sure sharks need to keep moving or they&apos;ll perish, and judging by the small disposable cooler he was keeping it in, the fish has likely passed on.&quot; </p>

<p>This looks like a baby sand shark, which have been spotted in Coney Island a lot. The guy was asking $100 for it, but no straphangers took the bait (at least when our tipster was on board&#x2014;he boarded at Essex Street and was headed towards Brooklyn).</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to PETA and the Humane Society of the U.S. for comment.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> PETA has sent us their official statement, saying, &quot;This guy may get bitten in the ass again after PETA reports to the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) that he is illegally selling a shark on the New York subway.&quot;</p>

<p>And Patrick Kwan, the NY State Director of the HSUS, tells us, &quot;the shark appears to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507142050/http://dsc.discovery.com/sharks/smooth-dogfish-shark.html">young smooth dogfish shark</a>,&quot; and adds, &#x201C;This is not only cruel and inhumane; peddling animals on the subways is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507142050/http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm#use">against the law</a>. Anyone who witnesses such behavior should alert a police officer, train operator, or other MTA personnel.&#x201D;</p>
