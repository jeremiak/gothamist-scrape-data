He just posted his latest piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023239/http://instagram.com/p/fQEYojK-we/">on Instagram</a>, stating it&apos;s on the Lower East Side. But where? The surface of his &quot;canvas&quot; doesn&apos;t look like your average city wall... and that&apos;s definitely a real car. We&apos;ll update when we know more.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Looks like it&apos;s in an empty lot on Ludlow between Stanton and Rivington (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023239/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=157+ludlow+street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.720941,-73.98791&amp;spn=0.004911,0.007757&amp;sll=40.721023,-73.988180&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,302.55,,0,-12.26&amp;cbll=40.720945,-73.987908&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=157+Ludlow+St,+New+York,+10002&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=0cTu8rmmO89JAsowQIxqXQ">closer to Stanton</a>). </p>

<p>The accompanying audio&#x2014;which is not on his 1-800 number yet, but is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023239/http://www.banksy.co.uk/2013/10/09/lower-east-side">on his website</a>&#x2014;comes from the audio recording of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023239/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike#Commentary">an attack on Iraqi civilians in Baghdad in 2007</a> that was given by Chelsea Manning to Wikileaks. The callsigns of the two Apache helicopters involved in the attack were &quot;Crazyhorse 1/8&quot; and &quot;Crazyhorse 1/9.&quot; At least 12 people were killed in the attack, including two journalists working for Reuters, and 2 children were wounded. One of the American soliders involved can be heard remarking, &quot;Well, it&apos;s their fault for bringing kids into a battle.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 12:40 p.m.:</strong> Richie Chang, age 64, lives in the area and tells us there was a blue tarp over the fence yesterday afternoon/evening blocking the view to the lot&#x2014;it was over the whole gate, and Banksy was likely painting this from inside.</p>

<p>Here are some videos taken by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023239/http://www.wayiseethings.com/">Nic Garcia</a> showing the scene from inside of the lot, and inside the car:</p>
