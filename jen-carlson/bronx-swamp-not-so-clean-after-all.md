<p>Just last week we were patting the city on the back for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124171216/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/22/bronx_swamp_went_from_cesspool_to_j.php">cleaning up the &quot;Bronx Swamp&quot;</a> &#x2014;&#xA0;but now we&apos;ve encountered a huge buzzkill. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124171216/http://ltvsquad.com/Blog/?p=153">The LTV Squad</a> reports live from the scene and says, &quot;what we found was that the city has done the minimal amount of work and has left the tunnel under St. Mary&#x2019;s park completely fetid and flooded to boot. This tunnel was once dry enough to serve as a safe haven to migratory cave dwelling birds. Today though it&#x2019;s the same old health hazard that the city promised it would eliminate.&quot; They make the assumption that the city only cleaned the parts visible to the public, leaving &quot;a toxic soup directly under a park where children play.&quot; Yikes.</p>

<p>The city was pressured to clean up the &quot;swamp&quot; when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124171216/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/03/bronx_swamp_1.php">locals were worried</a> about health hazards. But the land is actually privately owned by someone they have yet to locate.</p>
