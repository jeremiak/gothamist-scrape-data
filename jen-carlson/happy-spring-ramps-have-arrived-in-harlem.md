<p>Row House, located at Frederick Douglass Blvd and 115th Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064128/http://rowhouseharlem.com/">in Harlem</a>, has alerted us to some very important news concerning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064128/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">ramps</a>, spring&apos;s finest vegetable: they&apos;ve back in season, and they&apos;ve got &apos;em.</p>

<p>These little guys usually hit the greenmarkets around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064128/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/18/ramps_where_are_they_now.php">the first week of April</a>, but typically they&apos;ll show up in restaurants a little earlier. So here we are: the first Ramps In A Restaurant news of the season. </p>

<p>Per the Row House, &quot;Chef Andrew Welch has started previews of the new spring menu with an early shipment of the popular spring onion. By cultivating a relationship with purveyors, Chef Welch was able to gain early access to the first shipment of this season&#x2019;s ramps coming from Virginia. This extra early shipment broke his last record of March 25th by almost a week.&quot; Congratulations Chef Welch, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803064128/http://gothamist.com/tags/rampswatch">from ramps biggest fan</a>.</p>

<p>The ramps will turn up tonight on the plate for the restaurant&apos;s weekend special (pictured): Grilled Pork Loin with a Ramp Salsa Verde, Braised Morel Mushrooms, Fiddlehead Ferns &amp; Fingerling Potatoes. (Fiddlehead Ferns are spring&apos;s worst offering&#x2014;you can push those to the side. Keep pushing. Keep pushing. Are they off the plate? Good. Now focus on the ramps.)</p>

<p>The Row House&apos;s full spring menu, packed with more ramps, is set to launch on April 1st. </p>

<p><em>Row House is located at 2128 Frederick Douglass Boulevard at the corner of 115th Street, and they are now serving #ramps.</em></p>
