<p>You know those ads in the subway telling you how much the MTA has improved, or is working upon improving the city&apos;s mass transit system? Heh, <em>always good for a laugh.</em> And today this one was brought to our attention, stating: New Switches, Less Bitches. Disappointingly, however, when we asked our MTA contact if the agency was sassing the straphangers, they told us the sign was altered from the original, which is less amusing (New Switches, Less Hitches).</p>
