</p><p>There seem to be a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010443/http://LVHRD.com/">LVHRD</a> events lately! Tonight they present Bi-FOLD II: Street. 

</p><p>The event will bring together two diverse artists inspired by the same muse, the street. The night will include both presentation and performance, including Brazilian graffiti artist Speto, who will present his work and create a live mural, followed by an interactive performance piece with New York based Graffiti Research Lab.</p>

<p>Who better to introduce these folks than our very own Jake Dobkin. Here&apos;s some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010443/https://lvhrd.com/private/arc_e.php?event_id=15">background info</a> on the artists, though we&apos;re sure Jake will be able to enlighten you a bit more in his intro tonight: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;SPETO is an influential Brazilian street artist who has quickly developed an international following via his association with Brahma as an ambassador for Brazil&apos;s leading beer. Hailing from Sao Paulo, Speto draws from the country&apos;s cultural diversity and sites Brazilian folk art, urban street culture and hip hop as his influences. He is well known for his bold expressive murals and has exhibited his work in Paris, London, Germany, Ukraine, Russia, Canada, and the U.S. Speto has created CD artwork for several Brazilian bands, as well as works in animation.

<p>GRAFFITI RESEARCH LAB is dedicated to outfitting graffiti writers, artists and protesters with open source tools for urban communication. The goal of the G.R.L. is to technologically empower individuals to creatively alter and reclaim their surroundings from commercial and corporate culture.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>To recap: Indoor street art, Jake Dobkin, and did we mention the free Brahma Beer? </p>
