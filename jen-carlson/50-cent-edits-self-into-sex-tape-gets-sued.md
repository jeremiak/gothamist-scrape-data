										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="50centsextape.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214124im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/50centsextape.jpg" width="300" height="359" class="image-left"> </span>A Florida woman, Lastonia Leviston, has sued rapper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214124/http://gothamist.com/tags/50cent">50 Cent</a> in Manhattan for editing himself&#x2014;wearing a curly wig&#x2014;into her personal sex tape. This is definitely better than the time he was embroiled in an 400,000,000 cent lawsuit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214124/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/24/50_cent_sues_taco_bell_for_4m.php">against Taco Bell</a>!</p>

<p>The rapper, real name Curtis Jackson, got his hands on Leviston&apos;s sex tape which she filmed in 2008 with Maurice Murray&#x2014;she says since then he has unlawfully distributed it over the Internet. 50 Cent shows up in the video providing a voice-over narration and full-on commentary in his Pimpin&apos; Curly persona (including a shocked moment when he discovers condoms are <em>not</em> being used). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214124/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632610/20100225/50_cent.jhtml">MTV reports</a> that he released it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214124/http://www.youtube.com/user/thisis50interviews?blend=1&amp;ob=4">on ThisIs50</a> as &quot;part of a long-running beef [with Rick Ross], which featured a number of dis-heavy mixtape songs, [and] mocking videos.&quot; Leviston is allegedly one of Ross&apos;s baby mamas, and has his initials tattooed on her chest.</p>

<p>Leviston&apos;s lawsuit, filed yesterday, claims unauthorized use of her name/image and emotional distress caused since the public release of the video... which is still online! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214124/http://fleshbot.com/5170859/50-cent-releases-sex-tape-to-humiliate-rap-rival">Get it while it&apos;s hot</a>.</p>
