<p>While their pitch of being &quot;quirky&quot; and filled with &quot;silly shenanigans&quot; but sans &quot;Zooey Dechawhatever&quot; was a little grating, we pushed through and checked out the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828015514/http://www.youtube.com/bigcitywebseries">Big City</a> webseries... and it&apos;s actually great and not really quirky at all! If we had to play the compare game, we&apos;d go more <em>Seinfeld</em>ian with its embracement of nothingness, and slightly <em>Girls</em>-esque with the whole young-people-bantering-while-battling-day-to-day-urban-life thing. But really it&apos;s just its own thing, and can stand on its own without comparisons. Below is the first episode, where the main female protagonist gets lost in &quot;deep Bed-Stuy&quot; on her new bike.</p>

Watch through episode 4 and you&apos;ll get a cameo from Mat Devine of the band Kill Hannah and cursed hit musical <em>Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark.</em></p>
