<span class="photo_caption">These authentic vintage Williamsburg Bridge light fixtures will make your condo seem less soulless. Buy yours now!</span></p>

<p>We were just checking in on the DoT auction site, which earlier this year was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728131141/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/05/the_brooklyn_bridge_paint_is_for_sa.php">selling off paint</a> that was used on the Brooklyn Bridge. And now it seems the city agency has been turned on to how HOT/<em>over</em> Williamsburg is&#x2014;time to dust off those old light fixtures from the bridge! The Williamsburg Bridge Necklace Lights Fixtures, which still work, are currently being auctioned off with a starting price of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728131141/http://www.publicsurplus.com/sms/nycdcas,ny/auction/view?auc=878975">just $20</a>. </p>

<p>Not only will you own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728131141/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/03/28_photos_of_williamsburg_youve_nev.php#photo-1">a piece of New York City history</a>, but much <em>more</em> importantly, you&apos;ll own the opportunity to make money off of people with too much money to spend on decorating their luxury Williamsburg condo.</p>

<p>There is basically no way that these light fixtures, branded correctly, will not sell out within the first hour of the next Brooklyn Flea. Just say words like: vintage, artisanal (that word has lost all meaning anyway), DIY, repurposed, limited edition, reclaimed, authentic, mason jar, industrial chic, WILLIAMSBURG, and Brooklyn. </p>

<p>It&apos;s GOLD, Jerry... just ask the guy who bought gallons of that aforementioned Brooklyn Bridge paint and is now reselling it for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728131141/http://brooklynbased.net/email/2013/05/surplus-paint-from-the-brooklyn-bridge-gets-a-second-act/">$25 a quart</a>.</p>
