										<p>Revel New York has released another video in their amazing series, which profiles all sorts of New Yorkers. You already met the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504121221/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/12/video_3.php">Pigeon Lady</a>, but they&apos;ve also talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504121221/http://www.revelinnewyork.com/videos/jim-hester">Hester Diamond</a> (Mike D&apos;s mom) and now their latest piece delves into the world of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504121221/http://www.revelinnewyork.com/videos/danny-jacobs">Brooklyn boxer Danny Jacobs</a>. </p>

<p>Born and raised in Brownsville, he&apos;s currently 18-0 with 15 knockouts and a contender for middleweight championship in the coming months. &quot;Jacobs has been compared to Mike Tyson due to his savage beatings and quick assaulting knockouts, but unlike Tyson, when Jacobs is outside of the ring, he&apos;s a self described &apos;mama&apos;s boy and family man,&apos; who&apos;s looking to be New York City&apos;s iconic sports figure.&quot;</p>
