<span class="photo_caption">It will not look like this. This is from a Civil War reenactment on Governors Island. (Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012536/http://www.flickr.com/photos/thoth1618/4869822382/">thoth1618&apos;s flickr</a>)</span></p>

<p>On the last night of summer, September 21st, some lucky New Yorkers will be able to (legally) pitch a tent and camp out in parks across the five boroughs. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012536/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/02/go_camping_for_free_in_one_of_nycs.php">annual event</a>, run by the Urban Park Rangers, only awards very limited spots through their lottery.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012536/http://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/registration">enter online</a>, or via telephone (718.421.2021), just like in the old times when people lived in tents without wifi. Currently only Prospect Park (30 spots), and High Rock Park (30 spots) are still open. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012536/http://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/registration">Check here</a> for specific details on each park&apos;s lottery.</p>

<p>If you don&apos;t win, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012536/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/enter-a-lottery-to-pitch-a-tent-in-prospect-park.html">FIPS recommends</a> just showing up and daring them to arrest you in front of The Children. If you do that, please send us video of your arrest, and remember to hold your phone horizontally.</p>
