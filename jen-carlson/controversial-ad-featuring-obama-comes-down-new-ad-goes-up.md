<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708074142/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/obama_selling_jackets_in_times_squa.php">January 7th</a>, Weatherproof Garment Company got their money&apos;s worth from a billboard they put up in Times Square which featured a photograph of the President in one of their jackets, and received lots of press. It wasn&apos;t Photoshopped, Obama actually wore their jacket on a trip to the Great Wall in China, and the company later got the rights to a photograph from that trip. However, they didn&apos;t get any sort of blessing from the White House to use Obama&apos;s image to hock their product.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708074142/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/08/obama_ad.php">January 8th</a> the company said they would take their billboards down after speaking to the counsel&apos;s office, and after White House spokesman Ben LaBolt publicly stated they have &quot;a longstanding policy disapproving the use of the president&apos;s name and likeness for commercial purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>And this morning, 20 days after it went up, the ad is finally coming down. A reader just sent us this image of the billboard being stripped; anyone in Queens see if the one by the Midtown Tunnel came down?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Just a couple of hours later, and a new ad has already gone up. The tagline: &quot;Fit For A President.&quot;</p>
