Shortly after an update came in saying the accident was fatal. There aren&apos;t many details beyond those available yet, but eyewitnesses say the motorcycle was actually a Vespa, and it was hit (and totaled) by a black car. The Vespa driver is the one who died, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140830122823/http://www.urb.com/permalink/7075/Josh-Wink-Killed-In-Traffic-Accident-(UNTRUE)).html">URB Magazine</a> reports it was deejay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140830122823/http://www.responsenyc.com/info/">Josh Link</a> (friends are confirming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140830122823/http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22josh+link%22">on Twitter</a>). Many witnessed the scene, which has been described as bloody, and one even posted their thoughts on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140830122823/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mis/1341044815.html">Craigslist</a>, noting that late last night there were burning candles where the crash happened. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> It has been confirmed that Josh Link was the victim in this sad accident, and services will be held on Long Island tomorrow.</p>
