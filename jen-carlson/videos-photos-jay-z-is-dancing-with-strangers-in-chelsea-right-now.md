</div></div>					<p>Yesterday we received <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143903/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/photos_jay-z_is_dancing_with_strang.php#photo-6">this invite</a>, which read: &quot;Please join <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143903/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay-Z</a> to take part in his new docu-music video <em>Picasso Baby</em>. Feel free to send the invite around to artists, friends, collaborators, lovers&#x2014;the only rule is circulation must be kept private! Sadly no tweeting or insta or social.&quot; But of course everyone who received the invite and attended is breaking the rules, shooting out transmissions from the event live (hopefully on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143903/http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/complete-list-of-every-product-endorsed-by-jay-z.html">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>!), including these photos of Jay-Z dancing with art historian and curator RoseLee Goldberg, some VIP kids, and more.</p>

<p>So far no sightings of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143903/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovic">Marina Abramovic</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143903/http://gothamist.com/tags/tildaswinton">Tilda in a box</a>, or the  proto-Cubist piece <em>Les Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon</em>... but this goes on til 6 p.m. Cue James Franco tangoing in drag in 3..2... We&apos;ve got someone on the inside, and will be updating as we hear more.</p>

<p><strong>LINE UPDATE:</strong> Here&apos;s what the line looked like around 3:30 p.m.&#x2014;but remember, you can&apos;t get in without having RSVP to an invite.

<p><strong>LENA DUNHAM UPDATE</strong>&#x2014;She wants you to know her artist mom is with Jay-Z but doesn&apos;t want you to know why because it&apos;s a famous person &quot;secret&quot; or whatever:</p>
