Now we&apos;ve seen everything! The composer will team up with his old pal (who he was once an assistant for) on June 27th, for a once-in-a-lifetime concert inside of Serra&apos;s current installation at David Zwirner Gallery. <p></p>

<p>First, a little more on the Glass/Serra bromance, which bloomed in the &apos;60s&#x2014;per a 2002 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150909110951/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/08/05/man-of-steel">New Yorker article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Phil took me to see Buster Keaton films, which I&apos;d never seen before, and I took him to Brancusi&apos;s studio,&#x201D; Serra remembers. Serra spent a lot of time sketching in Brancusi&apos;s studio, which had been re-created in the Mus&#xE9;e d&apos;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. &#x201C;It was the first time I looked at sculpture seriously,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I really responded to the strength and simplicity and abstraction of the work. I just found myself being drawn back to that studio every day.&#x201D; In the evenings, he and Glass would go to La Coupole and stare at Giacometti.</blockquote>
