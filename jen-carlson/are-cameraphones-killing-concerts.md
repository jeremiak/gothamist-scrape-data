										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="cameraphoneconcert.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028102419im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cameraphoneconcert.jpg" width="350" height="247"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo by Jen Carlson/Gothamist</span></i></div> Did you hear about that guy in Los Angeles whose Natalie Merchant concert vibe was harshed by that dude and his cell phone? No? Well, he&apos;s just one poster boy for the masses who want technology turned off at concerts, and today the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028102419/http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052748704129204575506281834570988-lMyQjAxMTAwMDIwNDEyNDQyWj.html">Wall Street Journal</a> stage dives right into the controversy&#x2014;because if video killed the radio star, couldn&apos;t camera phones kill a concert?<p></p>

<p>Merchant herself addressed the crowd that night saying, &quot;I&apos;m right here. This is live. This is where the show is.&quot; And she isn&apos;t the only one who doesn&apos;t want the audience filling up their Twitters and YouTubes and Facebooks with (usually poor quality) video. Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes told the WSJ, &quot;As a band we&apos;ve been trying to string together these moments, the kind of moments I&apos;ve had as a music fan that have blown my mind. That&apos;s not happening when you&apos;re texting or checking your fucking fantasy league stats. <strong>I personally think you should be too high to operate a machine at our concerts.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Robinson&apos;s band decided to prohibit photos and videos on their current tour, which at least one fan declared to be &quot;incredibly lame.&quot;</p>
