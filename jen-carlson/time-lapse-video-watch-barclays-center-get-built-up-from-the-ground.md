title: Time Lapse Video: Watch Barclays Center Get Built Up From The Ground
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925124612/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a> is officially open, so it&apos;s about time we got a time lapse video showing the arena getting built up from the ground. Check it out below, from excavation to completion, from 2008 through 2012. Our only complaint is that the soundtrack needs more Jay-Z&#x2014;can someone recut it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925124612/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UjsXo9l6I8">with this one</a>?</p>
