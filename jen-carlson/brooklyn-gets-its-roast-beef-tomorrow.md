<p>Brooklyn&apos;s first ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001157/http://gothamist.com/tags/arbys">Arby&apos;s</a> is <em>thisclose</em> to opening. The fast food chain has taken over the landmark Gage and Tollner building on Fulton Street &#x2014; where a classy eatery once operated, even serving starlets like Mae West. But those days are over, and the roast beef peddler will be filling bellies in the borough starting tomorrow. Lost City got a sneak peek; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001157/http://lostnewyorkcity.blogspot.com/2010/01/sneak-peek-at-inside-of-gage-tollner.html#more">check out more photos here</a>. The historic gas light fixtures have been kept intact, so this isn&apos;t a complete sacrilege. </p>

<p>Some facts we were told by the franchise&apos;s publicist: 110 new jobs were brought in to the area; there will be free Wi-Fi for patrons; and for those craving some curly fries: hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>
