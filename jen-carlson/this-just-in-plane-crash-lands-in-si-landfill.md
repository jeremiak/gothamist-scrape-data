Last year on this day, the United Airways <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151324/http://gothamist.com/tags/flight1549">Flight 1549</a> flight landed in the Hudson River (no serious injuries thanks to the smooth flying of Sully!)... and we just got word that an aircraft has crash landed in a Staten Island Landfill. Word is that the &quot;Piper Cub&quot; landed safely, and the pilot is now outside of the aircraft and walking it off. According to reports coming over the newswire, the emergency landing was due to a mechanical failure, and the police are stating there is &quot;debris or the banner the plane was towing down on the N/B Shore Expwy.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151324/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/plane-lands-on-big-pile-of-garbage/">CityRoom</a> reports that the plane&apos;s banner was to mark the one-year anniversary of Flight 1549&#x2019;s safe landing, and read: &quot;If you died today, would you go to heaven or hell? John 14:6.&quot; The company who owns the plane, Air Sign, declined to comment on who the client was who rented the plane.</p>
