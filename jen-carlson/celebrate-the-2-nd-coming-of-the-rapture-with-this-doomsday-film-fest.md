<p>Are you <em>still</em> without plans for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206180728/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/what_will_you_do_the_day_before_the.php#photo-1">the Rapture Part II</a>? No worries. You can head to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206180728/http://www.92y.org/Tribeca/Events-Details-and-Categories/Events/Art-Gallery/92YTribeca-Film-Screenings/Film-Series/Doomsday-Film-Festival---Symposium.aspx">Doomsday Film Festival &amp; Symposium</a> taking place all weekend (well isn&apos;t that optimistic), at the 92YTriBeca. They&apos;re promising &quot;Deserted streets! Blood-red skies! Total Social Breakdown!&quot; And of course, some good ol&apos; destruction porn. </p>

<blockquote>Join us for a selection of rare-to-infamous apocalyptic films and several talks with a wide variety of Doomday experts&#x2014;neuroscientists, authors, critics, roboticists, and even a chaplain. The festival also incorporates a gallery exhibit, bomb shelter lounge and a DJ&#x2019;d mix of PSAs, industrial noise, and nuclear meltdown sirens&#x2014;in short, the End will be all kinds of Nigh.</blockquote>

<p>Attendees are encouraged to dress in their best Apocalyptic attire (SARS masks, hazmat suits, police officer zombies, crazed prophets, flesh-eating mutants, four horsemen, you get the idea). You can even pick your Apocalyptic poison, watching movies featuring End Times brought to you by zombies, black rain, asteroids, and Russians, to name a few. At the end of the festival, you can breathe a sigh of relief knowing you&apos;ve made it safely through another rapture... until that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206180728/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/10/111019-satellite-fall-earth-rosat-space-debris-nasa-science/#.Tp98HhE_etE.twitter">satellite falls on top of us Sunday</a>.</p>
