<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152117/https://twitter.com/MuseumModernArt/status/232520815034388480">MoMA Tweeted</a> that 30 works in their collection were recently analyzed by experts... or rather, children in kindergarten through the 5th grade. You can take their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152117/http://audiotourhack.com/unadulterated#tour">guided tour</a> while listening to the kids talk to you via previously recorded bits. Little ones are always so <em>brutally honest</em>, and these kids don&apos;t hold back. When addressing Jackson Pollock&apos;s work they basically call him a hack, and say he &quot;shouldn&apos;t be in art museums because it&apos;s just splatter paint.&quot;</p>

<p>This is all part of MoMA Unadulterated, &quot;an unofficial audio tour for the Museum of Modern Art&apos;s permanent collection that&apos;s created by kids. Each piece of art is expertly analyzed by kids aged 3-10, as they share their unique, unfiltered perspective on such things as composition, the art&apos;s deeper meaning, and why some stuff&apos;s so weird looking.&quot; But will they address <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152117/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/worlds_youngest_art_critic_upset_ab.php">the ageist lack of dinosaurs at the museum</a>?</p>
