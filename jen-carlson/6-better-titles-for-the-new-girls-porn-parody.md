<p>How did <em>this</em> take so long? An XXX-rated parody of the HBO series <em>GIRLS</em> now exists, somewhere in Hustler&apos;s HQ, but won&apos;t be released for a couple more months. What do we know about it so far? Well, the title is horribly disappointing for a porno&#x2014;it&apos;s being called <em>This Ain&apos;t Girls XXX</em>. As &quot;we&quot; like to remind you, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081418/http://dailyrefill.blogs.com/daily/2004/04/shock_awe_.html">&quot;we&quot; used to write porn</a>, so we have some suggestions:</p>

<p><em>Hannah Horvath Does Greenpoint<br>
Lena Done Him<br>
Zosia Slammed It <br>
Adam Drive-her<br>
The Penetration Of A Generation<br>
Cafe Bumpy<br>
</em><br>
These are all free for the taking, Hustler. But remember: it&apos;s not all about the title, content is important when parodying, <em>even in porn</em>. Disappointingly, star Richie Calhoun (who plays Adam Driver, is swimming in Old Porn Money, and clearly got the role because he&apos;s the great porn artiste Buck Calhoun&apos;s son) told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081418/http://www.xbiz.com/news/162921">XBIZ</a> that while he &quot;tried to make it as weird as possible&quot; he didn&apos;t make it &quot;that weird.&quot; C&apos;mon Calhoun, this is Lena Dunham&apos;s warped and naked world you&apos;re parodying, turn the weird up to 11! If someone isn&apos;t tits deep in a bathtub full of cake batter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081418/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/last_nights_girls_forget_about_the.php#photo-1">burning condoms</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081418/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/girls_gone_obsessive_compulsive.php">counting to 8</a>, and acting out a cringe-worthy role play scenario with their boss five minutes into this thing it&apos;s a catastrophic fail.</p>
