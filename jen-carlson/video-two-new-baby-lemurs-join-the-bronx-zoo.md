<p>The Bronx Zoo has some new babies! Two lemurs, a Coquerel&#x2019;s sifaka (which is an endangered species) and collared lemur, have just debuted there, and the Wildlife Conservation Society has some videos that you can &quot;awwwwww&quot; at below. The two will join the three other types of lemurs at the Zoo&apos;s Madagascar exhibit, and are likely to be equally unhappy with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140117/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/video_chewy_the_marmoset_not_happy.php">budget cuts</a>.</p>

<p>According to the WCS&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603140117/http://www.wcs.org/press/press-releases/two-lemur-babies-debut-at-bz.aspx">press release</a>, &quot;Coquerel&#x2019;s sifakas spend most of their time in trees and leap effortlessly, launching themselves vertically with their strong legs. Like most species of lemurs, the females are dominant to the males, claiming the choicest food and the best sleeping and sunning spots.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Collared lemurs use their long tails to balance when leaping through the forest canopy. Collared lemurs live in groups of males and females but are not matriarchal like the sifaka and many other lemurs.&quot;</p>
