										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="herointips0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160817153333im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/herointips0110.jpg" width="275" height="383" class="image-left"> </span>Hey taxpayers, we just spent $32,000 on a Department of Health designed Heroin guidebook, complete with helpful illustrations! Just think of all the smack we could have gotten with that money. 70,000 copies of the 16-page pamphlet were printed out, and it&apos;s unsurprisingly garnering criticisms from just about everyone. </p>

<p>The tip sheet tells heroin users how to prepare and inject the drugs in a safe manner that can help addicts avoid infection. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160817153333/http://www.1010wins.com/NYC-Funded-Handout-Called--How-To--for-Drug-Users/6024584">1010Wins</a>, DEA Special Agent-In-Charge John Gilbride says the handout is &quot;very disturbing&quot; and described it as &quot;a step-by-step instruction on how to inject a poison&quot; &#x2014; while the city health officials contend the flier will help save lives. The how-to heroin guide includes illustrations accompanied by junkie lingo and text such as: &quot;Warm your body (jump up and down) to show your veins... Only &apos;boot&apos; once or twice in one shot.&quot;</p>

<p>Amongst those criticizing the DoH is Council Member Peter Vallone, Jr. who, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160817153333/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/heroin_for_dummies_oLIfe1Gxl7RMk9iJZiWlnL">the Post</a>, said it was &quot;sick... It sends a message to our youth: give it a try.&quot; Perhaps the Department of Education should screen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160817153333/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgCprJPSlpA"><em>Trainspotting</em></a> to counteract it.</p>
