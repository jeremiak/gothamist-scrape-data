										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="prettywoman02211a.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084916im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/prettywoman02211a.jpg" width="200" height="182" class="image-left"> </span>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084916/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/ff_sextrade/all/1">Wired</a> took a look at the sex worker industry in New York City and turned out a series of fun stats! For instance, what would a hand job cost you in <em>your</em> neighborhood? If you&apos;re in the Bronx, it&apos;s just 75 bucks plus a shot at the bar. In Manhattan, it&apos;s $125 north of 14th Street, but if you go to Chinatown or Soho, the price goes up to $175. Meanwhile, in the TriBeca-Wall Street area, a hand job will cost you a whopping $225&#x2014;that&apos;s just $175 less than mommy role-play sex! </p>

<p>Other fun facts: sex workers prefer Orbit and Trident gums (sex workers: they&apos;re just like us!), and often carry an extra pair of panties in their purse in case their client deserves a souvenir. As of 2008, 25% of regular clients were found on Facebook (as opposed to Craigslist which only brought in 3%). [Insert Super Poke joke here.]</p>
