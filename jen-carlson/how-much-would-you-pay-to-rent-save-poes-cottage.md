<p>Edgar Allan Poe came to Manhattan in April of 1844 hoping to make a name for himself in the literary world, and two years later found himself moving to a cottage in the Bronx with his wife Virginia who was suffering from tuberculosis (she died there a year later). Poe eventually moved to Richmond, Virginia, but his time in New York is still making headlines; recently a letter was discovered in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904142850/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/10/edgar_allan_poe_letter_includes_apo.php">he apologizes</a> for his drunken behavior while in town, and now it&apos;s 163 years later and the Bronx County Historical Society is trying to save his old home.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904142850/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2010/11/03/2010-11-03_help_for_poe_house_edgar_cottage_fund_seeks_2m.html">the Daily News</a>, they need $2MM to help with operating expenses; the director of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904142850/http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/poecottage.html">the cottage</a> told them, &quot;We need to do this. There are so many things we are not able to do because of a small budget.&quot; They&apos;ve raised just $20K so far, and are having a fundraiser on December 10th at the National Arts Club in Manhattan to raise more (tickets will be $100 each).</p>

<p>The cottage&#x2014;located at East Kingsbridge Road and the Grand Concourse&#x2014;costs around $300K to run annually, with the city paying 40% of that. It&apos;s where Poe penned <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em> and <em>Annabel Lee</em>, which is surely worth something&#x2014;so maybe they can rent it out to a Poe fan. How much does a single-family home (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904142850/http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=477927&amp;id=338875440625&amp;fbid=10150253930990626&amp;ref=mf">renovated</a>, with a porch and yard!) go for in that area?</p>
