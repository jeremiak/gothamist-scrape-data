This week have some Springfield-style 3-dimensional fun by visiting the Kwik-E-Mart! </p>

<p>A dozen 7-Eleven&apos;s nationwide have transformed in to Springfield&apos;s favorite convenience store for the month. New York&apos;s is on 42nd Street between 8th and 9th Avenues. What you&apos;ll find: a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://www.flickr.com/photos/radicalninja/692302927/">Radioactive Man comic</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryjones/694195482/">Buzz Cola</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://www.flickr.com/photos/radicalninja/693119706/">KrustyO&apos;s cereal</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://www.flickr.com/photos/radiostaticstar/692426038/">Squishees</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mlaaker/690583762/in/photostream/">Sprinklicious donuts</a>, and a ton of references to past episodes (check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://www.flickr.com/photos/edley/692424076/">old man in the freezer</a>, and the above sign). </p>

<p>Sure, it&apos;s all marketing hype for the July 27th opening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://simpsonsmovie.com/">The Simpsons Movie</a>, but it&apos;s better than a billboard. The stores made the name switch early Sunday morning, and the locations had been kept a secret until then. As for the New York location, Geekanerd has already visited and taken some photos, check out their report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://geekanerd.blogspot.com/2007/07/best-pr-stunt-ever-kwik-e-mart-comes-to.html">here</a>. </p>

Everybody knows it&apos;s a joke. I&apos;m a big Simpsons fan myself, and maybe subconsciously it even inspired me to become a 7-Eleven owner.&quot;</p>

<p>One more thing: don&apos;t expect to find any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144925/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff_Beer_%28The_Simpsons%29">Duff Beer</a> there, the powers that be decided against bringing that product from cartoon to reality, as the movie is rated PG-13. </p>
