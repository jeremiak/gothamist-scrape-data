<p>On Saturday we headed to the SiriusXM studios on 49th Street to celebrate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111204020118/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/nirvanas_nevermind_turns_20.php">the 20th anniversary of <em>Nevermind</em></a>, and the start of our own midlife crisis. (How was that <em>twenty years ago</em>?) On hand were Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, Butch Vig (the album&apos;s producer), a few handfuls of listeners and press, Jon Stewart (who was moderating), and so much free wine. So much.</p>

<p>Sadly, the open bar made the audience a little chatty, and it was difficult to hear anyone inside of the glass box they were broadcasting out of. Instead, we drank the aforementioned wine and admired Novaselic&apos;s professor look (really, we&apos;re into it!). Right?</p>

<p>Stewart started the show off recalling the first time he heard the album, saying, &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe it. It had everything &#x2014;sonic menace, melody, urgency, irony. It was like the Beatles had swallowed Black Flag. I couldn&apos;t wait to love them, and then watch everyone else love them and then be really mad at them for everyone else loving them, while myself still secretly loving them.&quot; While we await a full transcript, check out the below video. </p>

<p>If you have access to Sirius, the two-hour show will reair tomorrow at noon, on the Nevermind Radio channel, naturally.</p>
