<p>Not quite outdoing her husband&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013905/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/15/mick_and_bill_o.php">60th birthday</a> bash at the Beacon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013905/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/20/this_just_in_th.php">last year</a> (which starred the Rolling Stones and was filmed by Martin Scorsese), Hillary Clinton entered a new age <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013905/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/10/25/2007-10-25_byoc_bring_your_own_checkbook_to_hillary.html">last night</a>. Choosing the same venue to celebrate her 60th in, the music was provided by Elvis Costello and the Wallflowers (apparently no one from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013905/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/17/senator_hilary.php">her campaign song list</a> was available), and Billy Crystal provided some humor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013905/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ioX-BzSUg-O4LUbclxzSUwoxPA0w">The AP</a> reports that she likened herself to the Wallflowers Jakob Dylan (perhaps not the best idea) saying that &quot;no matter how much her family connections may have helped propel her candidacy, she ultimately will win or lose on her own.&quot; Maybe she&apos;ll have more success than Jakob.</p>

I&apos;m not as, shall we say, workaholic, even though I work hard, it&apos;s not all-consuming. I just feel like I have a much more balanced view of life.&quot; Last night she managed to balance the two quite well, raising a couple million for her campaign while enjoying the company of friends and family.</p>

<p>The Daily News also reported that according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013905/http://hillaryclinton.com/">Clinton&apos;s website</a>, the cheapest seats ($100 and $250) were sold out, whereas the $1,000 and $2,300 orchestra seats were not. How much did it cost to afterparty with the birthday girl? $25,000. No word on if Ad Rock made an appearance, this summer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013905/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/07/adam_horovitz_m.php">he told us</a> he was supporting Hillary -- adding, &quot;I&#x2019;m sure my endorsement&#x2019;s going to be the best thing for the campaign.&quot;</p>
