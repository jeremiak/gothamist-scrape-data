                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2harrypottercast0611.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924060007im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2harrypottercast0611.jpg" width="640" height="371" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924060007/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/23/video_green_lantern_trailer_release.php">summer of CGI</a> has begun! And the U.S. premiere of the new, and final, <em>and 3-D</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924060007/http://gothamist.com/tags/harrypotter">Harry Potter</a> movie will premiere at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924060007/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2011/06/15/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-nyc-premiere-will-take-place-on-july-11/">on July 11th</a>, but before you take that final plunge into the Deathly Hallows, you can catch all of the previous Potter madness on the big screen again. The Museum of Moving Image presents &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924060007/http://www.movingimage.us/films/2011/07/06/detail/seven-nights-with-harry-potter/">Seven Nights With Harry Potter</a>,&quot; starting on July 6th with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924060007/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/">first film</a> from 2001 (aw, Harry was only 11 then!). </p>
