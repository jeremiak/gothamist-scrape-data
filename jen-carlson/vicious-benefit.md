<p>Gothamist wanted to make you aware of a very important event next week. As per usual on a Tuesday night at Rothko <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://jenyk.com/">jenyk/dot/com</a> + <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://www.melodynelson.com/">Melody Nelson</a> present <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://jenyk.com/VICIOUS.htm">VICIOUS</a>. However next week, the 25th, the show will be a benefit for Sarah Flynn. From Sarah&apos;s employer, the President of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://www.spinartrecords.com/">SpinART Records</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;One of spinART&apos;s employees has fallen seriously ill - she has been in the hospital for approx. 7 weeks.&#xA0;&#xA0; Her current treatment has the doctor&apos;s encouraged that their diagnosis of Wegener&apos;s Disease was correct.&#xA0; We are glad to get this good news, but she is far from being out of danger, and this will affect the rest of her life. Thankfully spinART has health care and the majority of her hospital costs will be covered, but the costs for her parents to stay in NY as well as her recovery time will be expensive.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>So come support Sarah and see some great bands while you&apos;re at it. The lineup goes something like this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://tedleo.com/">Ted Leo</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://www.benzosmusic.com/">Benzos</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://theheadset.com/">The Head Set</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://apollosunshine.com/">Apollo Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105325/http://www.thechinesestars.com/">Chinese Stars</a>, Guest DJ: James Murphy</p>
