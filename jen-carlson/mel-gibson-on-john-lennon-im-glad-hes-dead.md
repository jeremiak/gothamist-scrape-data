<p>This week it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172446/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2012/04/the-morning-fix-hunger-game-questions-the-mel-joe-show-axl-says-no.html">was announced</a> that Warner Bros. has put a movie about Judah Maccabee on hold after writer Joe Eszterhas and producer Mel Gibson got into a nasty exchange&#x2014;the former eventually penning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172446/http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/joe-eszterhas-explodes-mel-gibson-you-hate-jews-36957">a 9-page letter</a> to the actor accusing him of hating Jews. Gibson responded to the aforementioned letter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172446/http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/11/mel-gibson-macabees-joe-eszterhas-response-script-sucked/#.T4bvbZpWq-0">with his own</a>, claiming the movie was on hold because he was &quot;extraordinarily disappointed&quot; with Eszterhas&apos;s script; he signed off saying: &quot;this should be our last communication.&quot;</p>

<p>Not so fast, Gibson! Eszterhas is punching back with some hits from the archives. He claims that the actor even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172446/http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/327192/20120412/mel-gibson-eszterhas-john-lennon-oksana-maccabees.htm">attacked the late John Lennon</a> in one of his rants, declaring:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I&apos;m glad he&apos;s dead. He deserved to be shot. He was a fucking messianic. Listen to his songs! <em>Imagine</em>. I hate that fucking song. I&apos;m glad he&apos;s dead.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>All <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172446/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321860/">the Beaver movies</a> in the world won&apos;t make Gibson likeable after this one.</p>
