title: Gothamist House Recap: 32 Bands, 4 Days
---

<p>Later on we&apos;ll be posting our CMJ Awards (we&apos;re thinking of giving Kanye one, since he never wins anything)...but for now we wanted to take a look back at the four long days of shows we held at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://gothamist.com/arts_and_events/gothamist_house/2007/10/">Gothamist House</a>. </p>

<p>First of all, thanks to everyone who dropped by, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://WOXY.com/">WOXY</a>, and of course the bands (there were a lot of them!) for putting on some great shows. Some of our personal highlights were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.myspace.com/themuggabears">The Muggabears</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.myspace.com/thejealousgirlfriends">The Jealous Girlfriends</a>, two bands that hail from Brooklyn -- so we suggest you check them out as soon as humanly possible. Sadly, the buzz we got from their two sets wore off fast when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.myspace.com/teeth">The Teeth</a> took the stage. In the spirit of Dennis Miller we&apos;re going to take a moment here to rant. Ahem. Every once in a while you&apos;ll run into a band that has a mixture of ego, attitude and bravado that rubs everyone the wrong way. The Teeth were that band for us this year. They started off their set with a bang, literally -- they smashed one of the lighting fixtures with a guitar, and then ended it with an extra song or two despite their time being up. Taking our &quot;that was your last song&quot; comment as a &quot;suggestion&quot; the band kept going and even stopped mid-song to waste some time blowing up a balloon. After their mediocre set, they didn&apos;t even offer to help clean the shattered glass they sprayed across the room. Nice guys. But hey, 31 out of 32 ain&apos;t so bad.</p>

<p>Some of those other 32 bands we enjoyed: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.myspace.com/illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.myspace.com/patternismovement">Pattern is Movement</a>, Aaron Behrens, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.myspace.com/theepochs">The Epochs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://myspace.com/forms">The Forms</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.myspace.com/deadconfederate">Dead Confederate</a> (mostly because they brought a fog machine) and Reverend Billy. They all rocked the (White) Rabbit, and the latter simultaneously startled, shocked and sang everyone into a &quot;stop shopping&quot; frenzy. Stay tuned for a podcast, which WOXY is currently working on (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062614/http://www.flickr.com/photos/woxy/tags/gothamisthouse">check out their photos here</a>). </p>
