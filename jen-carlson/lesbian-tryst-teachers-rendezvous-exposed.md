										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="teachertryst.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125909im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/teachertryst.jpg" width="300" height="220" class="image-left"> </span><em>Shocking</em>. The<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125909/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/09/teacher_hot_for_teacher.php"> two female teachers caught going at it</a> in a darkened classroom last year, <em>were drunk</em>. As so many sort-of-lesbians before them, a little alcohol was needed before the two got down to business. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125909/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/07/09/2010-07-09_untitled__horndog09m.html">the Daily News</a>, the James Madison High School teachers&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125909/http://gothamist.com/tags/alinibrito">Alini Brito</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125909/http://gothamist.com/tags/cindymauro">Cindy Mauro</a>&#x2014; were at a local bar before their rendezvous which was interrupted by two inopportunistic handymen. </p>

<p>A report by city High School Superintendent Linda Waite has all of the details, which states on the evening of November 20th the two went for after-work drinks at Nora&apos;s Park Bench Caf&#xE9; in Marine Park with one other teacher and the assistant principal. They walked back to school later to watch SING!, a musical competition. Halfway through the show Brito and Mauro snuck off to room 337, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160101125909/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pTHCuez1zM">yadda yadda yadda</a>, then the handymen walked in and found &quot;a woman lying on the floor naked from the waist up.&quot; The other was naked and on her knees&#x2014;a witness reported, &quot;<strong>one female had on pants with no shirt; she was putting on a white bra with one breast still hanging out</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>The lawyer representing the teachers, who were cited as having &quot;inappropriate sexual behavior in Room 337&quot; and charged with misconduct, says the documents don&apos;t &quot;specify any sexual conduct. This is very different than the allegations of lesbian sex that were widely reported when this story first broke. Clearly the initial allegations have become diluted over time which is common for stories based on conjecture and exaggeration.&quot; No word <em>yet</em> if this non-lesbian-non-sex act was caught on tape...</p>
