<p>There is a classic <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905204323/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_Beholder">The Eye of the Beholder</a>,&quot; or in some airings &quot;The Private World Of Darkness,&quot; which tackles and distorts the idea of &quot;normal&quot; appearances.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905204323/http://streeteasy.com/building/362-broadway-brooklyn/b">This apartment listing</a> was sent in to us by a tipster who sarcastically referred to it as a &quot;gem.&quot; Maybe this tipster lives in one of those fancy 2-room apartments we aspire to and simply can&apos;t see the potential here. Maybe he&apos;s just into #basic beauty in brand new buildings filled with amenities that are not absolutely necessary to sustain human life. Maybe one man&apos;s garbage is another man&apos;s reasonably priced living space. Anyway, in the <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode, this tipster is kind of the villain.</p>

<p>Here is the secret to NYC: once you begin to embrace the fact that nothing is ugly, then this whole city opens right up to you. See the smallest, shower-IN-the-kitchenist apartments as <em>beautiful</em>, and the stress of finding a place you can afford will disappear. Why NOT live in this $1499/month apartment in Williamsburg? Other suckers are paying triple that to live in this neighborhood! </p>

<p>And just check out everything this place has to offer: a room (how many do you <em>really</em> need?), an exposed brick wall, distressed/rusted metal beams, a goddamn roof over your head <em>what more do you want</em>, a bathroom with shower, one drawer, a sink, a mini fridge, and location location location (literally right next to the subway tracks... maybe even under them? Maybe this IS a subway car?).</p>

<p>As <em>Twilight Zone</em> narrator Rod Serling said at the end of the episode, &quot;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, in this year or a hundred years hence. On this planet or wherever there is human life... beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Lesson to be learned.&quot;</p>
