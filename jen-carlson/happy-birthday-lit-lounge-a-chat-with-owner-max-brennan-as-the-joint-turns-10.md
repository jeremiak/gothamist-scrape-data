The 2nd Avenue establishment has been the go-to spot for many over the years, especially those looking for dark corners in which to do dark deeds. You just haven&apos;t really fully experienced New York City if you haven&apos;t been in that basement at 3:30 a.m. Sadly, our memories there have escaped us, so we talked to Lit owner Max Brennan about his.</em><p></p>

<p><strong>Why did you originally open Lit up, and what was the &quot;vision&quot;?</strong> All three of us worked in bars 10 years ago but we weren&apos;t happy with the seemingly one dimensional bar scene. I played in a band and ran a music website which had our functions at Bowery Ballroom each month. We would showcase local bands, local artists and local film makers. </p>

<p>Erik Foss was an artist and bartender at Bowery Ballroom and he showed his art in these functions. David Schwartz was also and artist and worked the door at Botanica. He was Erik&apos;s roommate and he found the space on 2nd Avenue which had previously burnt down, hence the name LIT. </p>

<p>So the vision was to open a bar/gallery for local musicians and artists. Not exactly a novel idea, of course, but we did it in our own little way with what little resources we had. A band venue downstairs with a DJ, and a bar lounge upstairs with a DJ and an art gallery separated in the back.</p>

<p><strong>How has the neighborhood changed throughout the years?</strong> The neighborhood has changed quite drastically, really. There were many little bar/venues for bands that have since gone out of business and have been replaced with upscale, over priced coffee lounges and designer clothing boutiques.  Also, all of the local musicians have since moved over to Brooklyn and it&apos;s harder and harder each year to get them to travel to LIT. Which is why I&apos;m opening a new bar in Brooklyn next month call The Flat on South 5th and Hooper Street. Also the bands don&apos;t draw anywhere near the amount what they used to draw.  <br>
 <br>
<strong>Are you upset about any of the changes?</strong> Not sure if &quot;upset&quot; is the right word, but maybe I&apos;m a little sad these venues closed. I had some great times in those places. I don&apos;t have such a great time at Starbucks, but the coffee is pretty good.</p>

<p><strong>Do you feel Lit has pretty much stayed the same throughout all of this?</strong> Yes for the most part, Lit as an entity has remained the same. We still have local and small touring bands play downstairs, and we still have local artists show in the gallery, Fuse, but of course the style of crowd has changed somewhat.  </p>

<p><strong>Are there any changes coming up for LIt?</strong> Probably less free drinks given out.<br>
 <br>
<strong>What&apos;s the most memorable moment you&apos;ve had there?</strong> Bauhaus performed at some big venue uptown, then all came to Lit&#x2014;David J (bassist) had an art show opening that same night in our Fuse gallery. Then the after party continued and Danial Ash (guitarist) got hammered. He was great to everyone, signing album covers, etc. Finally at 3:30 a.m. his assistants started telling him he has to leave, the limo is outside and you have another gig tomorrow! He stands up with a bottle of champagne in his hands and exclaims &quot;You all go on without me I&apos;m staying here! I&apos;m fine I&apos;ve been doing this for 27 years.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s funny, we get a lot of young bands doing after parties, and they all drink bottled water. Then the older bands like Gang Of Four, Bauhaus, Jesus Lizard will stay up all night getting wasted like there&apos;s no tomorrow. Times have changed.</p>

<p>You can say Happy Birthday to Lit, tonight:</p>
