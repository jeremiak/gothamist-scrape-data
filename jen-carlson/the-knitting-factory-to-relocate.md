The news doesn&apos;t come as a surprise as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164829/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/04/knitting_factor.php">last April</a> brought word that the building the venue is housed in would be sold. </p>

<p>This will be the third location for the club, which started off at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164829/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47+E+Houston+St,+New+York,+NY+10012,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">48 East Houston Street</a> some 20 years ago (it&apos;s been on Leonard Street for 14 of those years). So where to next? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164829/http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb3/html/calendar/calendar.shtml">This community board calendar</a> shows that earlier this month they applied for a &quot;full liquor&quot; license at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164829/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=506+E+14th+Street&amp;sll=40.734234,-73.979981&amp;sspn=0.007739,0.017166&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.73386,-73.980002&amp;spn=0.00774,0.017166&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=40.730361,-73.980252">504-508 E 14th Street</a>; they also mention a &quot;preliminary discussion regarding zoning variance to permit large entertainment venue.&quot; With a little bit of time on their side, there are likely other options they&apos;re perusing as well.   </p>

<p>Many music lovers would likely welcome a new location, as it stands The Knitting Factory isn&apos;t in an area that most of its patrons would normally find themselves. It&apos;ll be sad to see the longtime fixture leave its current spot though.
