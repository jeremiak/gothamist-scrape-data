<p>In the new season of Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s web series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175445/http://gothamist.com/tags/ComediansinCarsGettingCoffee"><em>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</em></a>, you&apos;ll see Howard Stern, Tina Fey, Jay Leno, Todd Barry, Patton Oswalt, and Louis C.K. alongside the comedy veteran and classic car fan. The trailer for season 3 was just released, and it&apos;s worth having to hear Seinfeld say &quot;cunnilingus&quot; in order to witness perfect human being Louis C.K. in a tiny car <em>and</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175445/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/04/photo_louis_cks_yacht_gets_stuck_in.php">on his yacht</a>.</p>
