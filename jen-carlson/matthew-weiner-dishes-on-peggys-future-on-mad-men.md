<p>In an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170341/http://tvline.com/2012/07/26/mad-men-matt-weiner-peggy-megan-season-7/">TVLine</a>, Weiner said, &#x201C;When people leave Sterling Cooper, sometimes it is the end for [the character]. But I will spoil that one tiny piece of anticipation and tell people that Elisabeth will be showing up to work... I can&#x2019;t say how much, in what capacity or what [her story] is going to be, but she has not left the show.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The sixth season of the show will go into production later this year, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170341/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mad-men-season-6-matthew-weiner-elisabeth-moss-354929">THR</a> says Weiner &quot;is confident that the option for a seventh will be picked up.&quot; After that, it&apos;s all over... and if you remember, Weiner already somewhat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170341/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/matthew_weiner_already_knows_how_ma.php">spoiled the big ending</a>.</p>
