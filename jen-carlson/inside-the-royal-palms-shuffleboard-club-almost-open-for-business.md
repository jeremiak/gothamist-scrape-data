</div></div>					<p>Recently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114052/http://gothamist.com/tags/shuffleboard">Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club</a> has been hosting some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114052/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffleboard#Game_play">biscuits and tangs</a> fans prior to their official opening (which will happen in a couple of weeks&#x2014;don&apos;t try to go there now!). Last night they held the first in a series of soft launch events (there will be two more this week, which you can try to get tickets to via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114052/https://www.facebook.com/RoyalPalmsShuffle">their Facebook page</a>), and co-owner Jonathan Schnapp sent us along some photos of the space as a little preview for what&apos;s inside.</p>

<p>The club will feature 10 courts (real courts, not that table shuffleboard business we&apos;re used to seeing in bars), and standard Bar Things, like live music, drinks, and food. In classic Brooklyn style, the latter will come mostly from a food truck parked in an indoor food truck bay. Schnapp tell us &quot;every day of the week there will be a different one once we&apos;re open.&quot;</p>

<p>To catch you up: the club&#x2014;located at 514 Union Street in Gowanus&#x2014;was announced in 2012, soon after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114052/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/why_arent_there_any_real_shuffleboa.php">we asked for a shuffleboard club</a> to spring into existence in New York City&#x2014;and that is what you call <em>magic</em>. Now we would like to see some Radiohead shows within walking distance of our office. </p>
