<p>Starting today, aspiring stars can head to Broadway to get some faux love from a new interactive public art installation located at Anita&apos;s Way (the passageway east of Broadway that connects 42nd and 43rd Streets). Described to us as an &#x201C;auto-affirmation machine,&quot; the piece will give each participant &quot;a virtual clapping 500-person audience&quot; as they stand under a spotlight and perform. Does standing in an alley performing for a clap track not sound depressing to you? Then head on over there! The installation will be there through November 22nd. BYO-Hugging machine to your after party.</p>
