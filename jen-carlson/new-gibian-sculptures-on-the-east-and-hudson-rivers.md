title: New Gibian Sculptures on the East and Hudson Rivers
---

	
										<p>Mark Gibian&apos;s sculpture in Brooklyn (entitled &quot;Crescendo&quot;) became the latest part of the Williamsburg waterfront in mid-May; &quot;the four-ton, crescent-shaped stainless steel sculpture was hoisted over the East River and installed on new 400-foot pier that&apos;s been constructed at Northside Piers.&quot; The sculpture is functional, providing shade and including a bench; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150122/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=5&amp;id=21224">the Brooklyn Eagle</a> reports that a shade structure was required under the zoning. While an exact date hasn&apos;t been set, the Piers (a direct result of the city&apos;s Greenpoint-Williamsburg Rezoning of 2005, which will also include 800 homes) will open up to the public sometime this summer. You may recall when one of the Northside Piers buildings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150122/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/26/williamsburg_co.php">went up in flames last Fall</a>.</p>

<p>Gibian is a 28-year resident of Williamsburg, but his work has also reached Manhattan. This morning his three-part, galvanized steel sculpture weighing more than 5,000 pounds was installed in the Tribeca segment of Hudson River Park. This one, entitled &quot;Serpentine Ensemble,&quot; is said to resemble the skeletal structures of a fish or ship. This new section of the Hudson River Park (from Laight St. to Houston St.) will also open to the public sometime this summer.</p>

<p>Today&apos;s sculpture installation was the third piece of work Gibian has added to the city; another resides at Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station.</p>
