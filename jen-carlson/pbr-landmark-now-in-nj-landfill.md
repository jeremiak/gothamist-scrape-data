The 60-foot-high bottle was chopped into about six pieces after standing tall and proud for over 70 years atop the brewery off the Garden State Parkway. While the &quot;managers at recycling company, which demolished the defunct Pabst brewery in Newark&apos;s West Ward for redevelopment, didn&apos;t want to talk about the dislocated landmark they now own,&quot; there are plenty of folks making offers on the pieces. One man, a New Jersey Institute of Technology professor and curator of the school&apos;s gallery, offered $500 for the cap and planned on somehow making it into a dining room table! However, it was estimated it would cost around $150K to move and install elsewhere&#x2014;of course, that quote may have also been based on the amount they estimate they&apos;ll get from the steel and copper scrap metal. Meanwhile, isn&apos;t there some giant John Deere trucker hat statue out there we can put this thing next to?</p>
