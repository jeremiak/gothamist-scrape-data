The company rents out <em>real</em> dogs and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231054052/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/30/business/main3111197.shtml?source=RSSattr=Business_3111197">opened in New York</a> last October...and yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231054052/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/nyregion/30dogs.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">NY Times</a> article has proof that people are <em>actually using it</em>.</p><blockquote>Ms. Stevenson explained why she was a customer: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m single and moved here from Scotland two years ago, and it&#x2019;s been difficult to meet people because everyone in New York just kind of goes about their business. But when I&#x2019;m walking around with Oliver, I seem to get into so many conversations about him. It becomes a nice way to meet people.&#x201D;</blockquote>The owner of the company, Chris Haddix, says &#x201C;There are a lot of people out there looking for companionship,&#x201D; and their five or six dogs available for rent can fill the void.  <p></p>

<p>The company rents out dogs they&apos;ve rescued from shelters, and is currently housed at the Wet Nose Doggy Gym at 34 East 13th Street. While it may be a better, albeit unstable, atmosphere for the dogs to be in -- the program seems a little bit <em>wrong</em>. Not to mention expensive, a monthly membership costs $279.95, and only includes four one-day rentals. Additional rentals cost $45 for a day.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231054052/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/05/flexpetz.php">Treehugger</a> has previously suggested, why not save your money and be a part-time dogwalker, or better yet volunteer at your neighborhood animal shelter.</p>
