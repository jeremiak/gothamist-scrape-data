title: Video: Lightsabers Meet Segways in Brooklyn
---

	
										<p>Last weekend some dayglo cardboard lightsabers smashed together <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152756/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/26/lightsabers.php">in Washington Square</a>, but did you know the real deal is over in Brooklyn? Leave it to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152756/http://www.vbs.tv/video.php?id=21491366001">Vice</a> to find the New York Jedi Academy, and to bring Segways into the mix. That&apos;s right: Sabersegging. Maybe the Academy should pick this up as a permanent course, because it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152756/http://nyjedi.com/">looks like business</a> isn&apos;t going so well.<br>
