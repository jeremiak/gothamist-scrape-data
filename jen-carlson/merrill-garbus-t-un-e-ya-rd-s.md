During live shows she&apos;s accompanied by Nate Brenner &#x2014; and currently they&apos;re both on tour with Dirty Projectors. They&apos;re in town all weekend (at Music Hall of Williamsburg and Bowery Ballroom) &#x2014; and they&apos;re even adding on a free show at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417165521/http://www.permanentrecords.info/">Permanent Records</a> (7 p.m.) in Brooklyn tonight. So you have no excuse not to catch them. This week Garbus told us a bit about Jay-Z, her ultimate supergroup, and why she insists on aLtErNaTiNg caps with lowercase.</em></p>

<p><strong>How has the tour with Dirty Projectors been going?</strong> AWESOME ROCK ROCK WHOOPEE</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any good anecdotes from the road?</strong> Hmm.  This dude fell on me in Athens, Georgia at a sort of warehousey show that friends put on.  It was the last song of the set, and he literally just fell from the front row into my drum and knocked my ukulele and hurt my wrist and I was so surprised that I almost started weeping spontaneously like a wee baby. </p>

<p>That show wasn&#x2019;t with the Dirty Projectors.  The anecdotes from that tour include things like, &#x201C;remember that time that the show was sold out and our minds were blown?&#x201D;  That anecdote happened just about every night.</p>

<p><strong>Why all the capital letters mixed in with lower case?!</strong> I was looking for a way to not only stick out as a practical thing&#x2014;that my stage name would stick out more if it looked weird&#x2014;but I find that a lot of people think &#x201C;female singer-songwriter&#x201D; and put it in a certain category, and I didn&#x2019;t feel like the music was like that, it was something different so I wanted to provide a little friction, or be a little bit of a pain in someone&#x2019;s ass, when they were typing my name.</p>

<p>It&apos;s funny how some people are really rubbed the wrong way by it, like I&#x2019;ve ruined their day by making them use that Shift key. But it sorta worked the way I wanted it to&#x2014;people pay attention. I don&#x2019;t wanna preach to people, but if there&#x2019;s anything that I want from my audience, it&#x2019;s a pause moment, and having people capitalize it that way perhaps gives them that moment to stop and think.</p>
