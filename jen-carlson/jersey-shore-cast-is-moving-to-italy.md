                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="jerseyshoreitaly01.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906064313im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jerseyshoreitaly01.jpg" width="225" height="156" class="image-right"> </span>Sometimes life isn&apos;t fair. Sometimes adults who choose to call themselves J-Woww and Snooki and The Situation get to experience beautiful Italy before you do. (And sometimes one of them becomes a New York Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906064313/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/01/snooki_new_york.php">best selling author</a>.) Anyway, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906064313/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> cast is moving to Italy... at least to film season 4 of their hit reality show. </p>
