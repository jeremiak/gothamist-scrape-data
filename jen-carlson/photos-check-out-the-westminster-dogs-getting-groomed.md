</div></div>					<p>The Westminster Dog Show is here, and all of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033742/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218839/">Christopher Guest-directed dreams</a> are coming true. The show kicked off today, and will run through tomorrow night (you can stream some of it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033742/http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/videos/Breed%20Judging/2014/Toy/pid:BT_rgV3mlEYW">online</a>). Here&apos;s a behind-the-scenes look at some of the dogs getting groomed and doing interviews.</p>

<p>Of course, if you object to the event, then simply meet up with PETA tonight at 5 p.m., when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033742/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/peta_9.php">they&apos;ll be having an anti-breeder protest outside of MSG</a>. Last week they sent out a release, stating: &quot;&apos;Master Race? Wrong for People. Wrong for Dogs. Ban Breeding&apos;&#x2014;that&apos;s PETA&apos;s message to Westminster Dog Show organizers and the American Kennel Club, which continue to encourage breeding unhealthy purebred dogs while homeless animals die by the millions every year because of the companion animal overpopulation crisis.&quot; PETA VP Daphna Nachminovitch says, &quot;A fetish for &apos;pure bloodlines&apos; and a disdain for &apos;mixed breeds&apos; is a despicable attitude to have toward any living being. As millions of animals die in animal shelters every year for lack of good homes, it&apos;s criminal to celebrate the breeders who contribute to this deadly overpopulation crisis.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, if you object to PETA hosting a protest that is essentially pointing fingers regarding the death of shelter dogs (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033742/http://rt.com/usa/peta-shelters-animals-killing-975/">since PETA is responsible for many of those deaths</a>)... then, who knows, just stay at home and click click click on this gallery. Remember, these adorable dogs are not at fault! It&apos;s their humans:</p>
