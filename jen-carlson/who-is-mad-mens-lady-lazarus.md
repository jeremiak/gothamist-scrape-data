<p><em>This post has more SPOILERS than our usual <em>Mad Men</em> posts, so stop reading now if you haven&apos;t seen last night&apos;s episode.

<p>Last night&apos;s episode of <em>Mad Men</em> was titled &quot;Lady Lazarus,&quot; also the title of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145623/http://www.sylviaplathforum.com/ll.html">a Sylvia Plath poem</a>&#x2014;but while the poem is about the pain of recreating oneself and <em>rising</em> from the dead, parts of the episode still left us with a feeling that a certain someone was going to stick his head in an oven soon. To look at it simply: we seem to have a Lady Lazarus <em>and</em> a Sylvia Plath on our hands here, and they both appear to be men (though your further analysis of the poem and <em>what this all means</em> is welcome!).</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="donbeatles0512.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145623im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/donbeatles0512.jpeg" width="640" height="454" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The reference to Plath&apos;s poem seems to be in relation to Don Draper (&quot;For the eyeing my scars, there is a charge / For the hearing of my heart&#x2014;It really goes / And there is a charge, a very large charge / For a word or a touch / Or a bit of blood&quot;). Don has been transforming this season, and at the end of the episode he&apos;s alone with some other meaningful words, listening to the Beatles&apos; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; (the album <em>Revolver</em> was released in August 1966), which right up front delivers the lyrics, &quot;It is not dying, it is not dying.&quot; Don is still growing into his new skin.</p>

<p>Pete Campbell, on the other hand, seems to have crawled inside of Don&apos;s <em>old</em> skin, and now can&apos;t find his way out. He <em>does</em> seem to be dying, and in the first scene even mentions that his life insurance policy covers suicide &quot;after two years.&quot; The entire season so far has had an undertone of dread, particularly in Pete&apos;s storyline, which makes sense as the 1960s were about fear just as much as they were about experimentation and reinvention. There&apos;s also potential for a non-suicidal death lurking around every corner, with Pete&apos;s bad driving, and now his new skis (more on that ski company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145623/http://dcist.com/2012/05/maryland_inventor_of_modern_skiing.php">over at DCist</a>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on a lighter note, the ad team is currently tackling Cool Whip, which didn&apos;t come onto the market until 1967, but seems to be in the final stages of testing during the episode. Here&apos;s an ad from 1971:</p>

<p>Recently we saw Roger Sterling trip on acid at a party where the Tibetan Book of the Dead was mentioned. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145623/http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=114">Fun fact</a>: John Lennon wrote &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; (which he called &quot;my first psychedelic song&quot;) while tripping on LSD. He &quot;recorded himself reading from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, played it back while tripping on LSD, and wrote the song.&quot;</p>
