										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="babiesbars0310.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184728im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/babiesbars0310.jpg" width="275" height="198" class="image-left"> </span>The Brownstone Brooklyn Bugaboo has made it all the way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184728/http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/03/02/brooklyn.babies.in.bars/index.html?hpt=C2">CNN</a>. Today the news source touches down on the touchy subject of Brooklyn parents bringing babies to bars. Nothing that hasn&apos;t been covered here before, though they sum up the debate through the words of a 26-year-old single woman and a stay-at-home dad, both from the borough.</p>

<p>The single, Julieanne Smolinski, says: &quot;I will get up on the subway for kids. I will be tolerant of them kicking the back of my seat while seeing a G-rated movie. But let me have my bars.&quot; Fair enough, though she goes on to say the parents at bars are just &quot;clinging to their youth.&quot;</p>

<p>In the other corner, the stay-at-home dad, Matt Gross, says being at home all day is &quot;isolating. Bars, as much as they&apos;re places to drink, they&apos;re places to socialize and meet people. I long for adult contact... I don&apos;t want to be excluded from the adult world.&quot;</p>

<p>Will this debate, going on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184728/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/27/union_hall_no_l.php">since at least 2008</a>, <em>ever end</em>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184728/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/17/babies_in_bars.php">Most recently</a> the idea of an early curfew for parents with kids was introduced at Brooklyn&apos;s Double Windsor, so perhaps that&apos;s the happy medium.</p>
