</div></div><p>High-end auction houses aren&apos;t very punk rock, but Christie&apos;s is about to put some classic punk era memorabilia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614133410/http://christies.com/LotFinder/searchresults.aspx?action=search&amp;intSaleID=21700#action=refine&amp;intSaleID=21700&amp;sid=764ba192-78eb-4d7a-9b21-5ef4082fde3b">on the block</a>. They announced the auction, which takes place November 24th, yesterday--and it will include more than 120 punk treasures from legends like the Ramones, the Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Blondie, David Bowie and more.</p>

<p>Christie&apos;s pop-culture chief Simeon Lipman told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614133410/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5izGUpipgtWnUUFWqiiMsEJSMvK-gD943Q9580">the AP</a>: &quot;We understand that tastes change, tastes mature. Ten years ago, punk memorabilia probably wouldn&apos;t be something we&apos;d be auctioning here. But now, people of a certain age have a certain ability to splurge on this material.&quot;</p>

<p>Too bad they didn&apos;t do this a few years ago, maybe they could have auctioned off CBGB. Now, put on your best <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614133410/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/23/goodbye_cbgb_he.php">John Varvatos</a> suit and get ready to drive another nail into the coffin.</p>
