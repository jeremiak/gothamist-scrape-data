<p>Around 1:30 a.m. alerts came in about a &quot;fire in a factory/restaurant&quot; on Kent Avenue (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000020/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=%22206+kent+ave%22+brooklyn&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;cid=0,0,3705522649692302861&amp;ll=40.717843,-73.964381&amp;spn=0,359.983156&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.717778,-73.964453&amp;panoid=Qlo8tHRctlzN4SAJvh4MNA&amp;cbp=12,282.62173869895025,,0,-1.2717451494372065">map</a>) in Williamsburg. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000020/http://imnotsayin.blogspot.com/2009/01/miss-williamsburg-diner-burns-monster.html">Word is</a> coming in now that the &quot;early morning fire gutted a landmark Northside diner, causing damage to an adjacent arts collective at Kent Avenue and Metropolitan.&quot; The establishment suffering extensive damages is the former Miss Williamsburg Diner (more recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000020/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/restaurants/archives/italianpizza/index.html">718</a>), with the two-story building next door getting less scathed. </p>

<p>While the diner may be a long time fixture in the neighborhood (even making a cameo in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000020/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/23/charlie_kaufman_director_1.php">Charlie Kaufman</a>&apos;s <em>Synechdoche, New York</em>), the neighboring building known as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000020/http://www.freenyc.net/archives/2006/09/monster_island.php">Monster Island</a>&quot; has recently drawn crowds through promoter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000020/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/07/todd_patrick_co.php">Todd P</a>. It also houses the Live With Animals and Secret Project Robot galleries, Mollusk surf shop, and possibly some band practice spaces.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Todd P tells us, &quot;We survived unscathed, save for a kicked in door and a busted out window on the second floor. No water, fire, or smoke damage, thankfully. Muchas Gracias to the FDNY!&quot;</p>
