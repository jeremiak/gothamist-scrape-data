<p>In August 1929 a Brooklyn man completed a massive DIY project: he built a plane in his apartment! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118134918/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2011/04/14/builds-plane-in-parlor-while-neighbors-wonder-at-noise/">Modern Mechanix</a>, neighbors kept hearing loud noises from Peter Lepicer&apos;s digs, and for months he would simply tell inquiring minds, &quot;Wait and see.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>The mystery was solved when he moved a two-seated monoplane which he built in his parlor. Workmen were required to tear part of the building away in order to get the plane out of the house. The plane was complete with the exception of the propeller, wings and landing gear, which he connected when he had extracted the ship from his parlor.</blockquote>
