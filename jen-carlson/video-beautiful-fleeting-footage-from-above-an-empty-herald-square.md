                            <p>This quadcopter footage was captured over a very empty looking Herald Square on 34th Street by Refractive Films. Unfortunately, it&apos;s just under one minute long, but we can assure you the Sunglass Hut has never looked so beautiful. </p>

<p>And since that was so short, here&apos;s a classic with footage of quadcopter going over the Brooklyn Bridge and practically touching Lady Liberty&apos;s torch!</p>
