</div></div>					<p>Have you seen these shots of a shanty town set up on Mercer and Houston Streets during the Great Depression? That&apos;s right, these (first two) photographs of men in suits reading magazines, smoking cigarettes and lingering about their alternative abodes aren&apos;t from the web pages of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115035215/http://unhappyhipsters.com/">Unhappy Hipsters</a>&#x2014;they were taken by Berenice Abbott in 1935. </p>

<p>Chances are you&apos;ve seen photos of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150115035215/http://pbskids.org/bigapplehistory/life/topic17.html">Hooverville</a> set up in Central Park around that time; though residents there were booted from that encampment before the Depression ended. According to a NY Times article from September 1932, &#x201D;The raid was staged on the orders of Deputy Parks Commissioner John Hart, who explained that the Park Department, much as it regretted it, intended to raze the settlement this morning. &#x2018;We don&#x2019;t want to do it, but we can&#x2019;t help it,&#x2019; Mr. Hart said, adding that although the men had maintained good order, had built comfortable shacks and furnished them as commodiously as they could, there were no water or sanitary facilities near the settlement.&#x201D; </p>
