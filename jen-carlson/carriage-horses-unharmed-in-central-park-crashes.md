										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="carriagehorsecp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428074446im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/carriagehorsecp.jpg" width="350" height="233" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428074446/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/carriage_horse_crash.php">two carriage horse accidents</a> that happened this month left two horses uninjured. But the ASPCA warns that these were lucky breaks for the equine, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428074446/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">the industry</a> should be banned before a horse, or person, is seriously injured. </p>

<p>The organization&apos;s Anita Kelso Edson told us, &quot;Though no complaints were officially lodged with the ASPCA&apos;s Humane Law Enforcement Department on either accident, [we] independently investigated both incidents. Dr. Pamela Corey, the ASPCA&apos;s Director of Equine Veterinary Services, confirmed that both horses were examined multiple times and neither horse was injured.&quot; Corey tells us, &quot;These two horses fortunately escaped unscathed from these accidents, but others in the past haven&apos;t been so fortunate. Horses and traffic are a dangerous combination.&quot;</p>

<p>There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428074446/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/19/horse_buggy_struck_on_ues.php">similar accidents</a> in the past, and some spooked horses have even died after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428074446/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/15/scared_by_drums.php">deadly dashes</a> through the city.</p>
