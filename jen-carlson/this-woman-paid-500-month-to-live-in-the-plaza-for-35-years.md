<p>It is nearly impossible to live in New York City for 35 years and only shell out $210,000, total. But Fannie Lowenstein did it, and she did it in style&#x2014;through some knowledge of the law, and willingness to deal with grumbles from the Plaza staff, she got a Central Park view on-the-cheap for much of her life. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032829/http://www.vice.com/read/the-eloise-from-hell-the-little-old-lady-who-terrorized-new-yorks-famed-plaza-hotel">to Vice</a>, Lowenstein&#x2014;a feisty, &quot;eccentric character&quot;&#x2014;scored an apartment at the iconic hotel that overlooked Fifth Avenue and Central Park. It&apos;s unclear, however, if there&apos;s any validity to reports that one-time owner Donald Trump moved her to a three-room suite with a Steinway piano in order to see progress in his plans for a condo conversion. This has been both disputed and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032829/http://therealdeal.com/2016/01/16/a-look-inside-trumps-famed-plaza-deal/">reported as fact</a>, but no one seems to be able to confirm. </p>

<p>Back to that cheap rent&#x2014;here&apos;s how it all happened:</p>

<blockquote>The story of Lowenstein and her apartment starts in the wake of World War II. Back then, a number of New York&apos;s grand hotels, the Plaza included, were on the skids and decided to take on long-term tenants to insure a monthly income. One such renter was Leo Lowenstein, who held a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and could presumably afford to pay market rates but wound up with a rent-controlled unit anyway. This status then transferred to his new wife, Fannie, in 1958; she became his widow three short years later. After that, Lowenstein stayed put.</blockquote>

<p>Attorney Gary Lyman, who repped the Plaza from 1977 to 2004 (that includes the time it was under the lock and key <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032829/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/business/what-donald-trumps-plaza-deal-reveals-about-his-white-house-bid.html">of Trump</a>), called her: &quot;the Eloise from hell. She walked around as if she owned the Plaza.&quot;</p>

<p>Lowenstein didn&apos;t just get cheap rent&#x2014;per the law, she got all of the services that were promised when she had first moved in, including &quot;high dusting,&quot; and a new paint job every couple of years.</p>

<p>Eventually she did depart the hotel, convinced there was toxic paint in her apartment, and relocated to the Park Lane, where she paid the nightly rate&#x2014;and that&apos;s where she died in April of 1992 at 85 years old. But she remains a rent control legend for life.</p>
