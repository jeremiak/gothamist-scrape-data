<p>Currently a perfectly fine building stands at the corner of Hubert and Collister Streets in Tribeca. The work-live space belonged to architect Winka Dubbledam, who sold it in 2014, and now someone may transform it into a mansion of their own. Forget the work part, just the l-i-v-i-n&apos; part this time around.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529163204/http://tribecatrib.com/content/modern-mansion-proposed-north-tribeca-historic-district">Tribeca Tribune</a>, the new design plan has been proposed by architect Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., and her collaborator William Bialosky&#x2014;it will feature metal, glass, and limestone. And it will house more rooms than any human needs...</p>

<p>The townhouse will be 5-stories, single-family, and 20,000-sq-ft. That will house 5 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a 5,000 square foot sports and fitness center, a courtyard, a dog room (!), a prep kitchen AND a catering kitchen, a wine closet, two bars, a screening room, his-and-her studies, a roof with solar panels, and other things you will never have in this lifetime.</p>

<p>The Landmarks Commission still has to approve the design, since this is located in Tribeca&apos;s North Historic District&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529163204/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2016/01/21/gigantic_private_mansion_may_overtake_tribeca_corner.php">Curbed</a>, at a recent meeting &quot;most members were enthusiastic about the design, but didn&apos;t want it to be in Tribeca.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently the house appears to be for rent, at least one unit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529163204/http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11-Hubert-St-1-New-York-NY-10013/2103402159_zpid/">for $15,000/month</a>.</p>
