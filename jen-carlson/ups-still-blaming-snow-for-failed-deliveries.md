										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="upssnowfail0211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164703im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/upssnowfail0211.jpg" width="250" height="161" class="image-left"> </span>Did the weather delay the delivery of your new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164703/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/03/more_crass_kenneth_cole_tweets.php">Kenneth Cole items</a>? That&apos;s UPS&apos;s story, and they&apos;re stickin&apos; to it. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164703/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/delivering_excuses_at_ups_qHWfyZ0pEFpreGmJ9acmzM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, the company continued to blame &quot;emergency conditions&quot; beyond their control for late, and not-yet-delivered packages yesterday. </p>

<p>Residents of Greenpoint, Astoria, Kensington, and Windsor Terrace have all reported (thus far) failed deliveries, even though online tracking says their goods are &quot;out for delivery.&quot; One man has been waiting since January 28th for a delivery to his Greenpoint home.</p>

<p>Drivers say with icy, snow-filled streets, they are unable to double park, so they just skip the drop-offs. One such driver told the paper, &quot;What&apos;s the point of having an accident&#x2014;probably $3,000&#x2014;to deliver a $30 package?&quot; A spokesman for the company says they leave the decision up to drivers, and in the meantime, &quot;we just need the sun to try to come out.&quot;</p>

<p>The President of UPS Canada, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164703/http://www.ehow.com/facts_7614372_ups-snow-policy.html">says</a>: &quot;Come sleet, snow, slush or ice, UPS customers can rest assured the packages will arrive safely and on schedule.&quot; Maybe their drivers can come give our drivers some tips. Since that probably won&apos;t happen, we suggest Tweeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164703/http://twitter.com/#!/evanatups">@EvanAtUPS</a>, who we can say from experience is the best go-to source when you&apos;re awaiting a package.</p>
