<p>On June 26th, 1927&#x2014;85 years ago this past Wednesday&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725071132/http://www.idexter.com/coasters/parks/coney_island/cyclone_index.html">the Cyclone</a> opened in Coney Island by Jack and Irving Rosenthal&#x2014;who bought land at the intersection of Surf Avenue and West 10th Street and laid down a $100,000 investment to have their coaster built (on the site of America&apos;s first rollercoaster, 1884&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725071132/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchback_Railway">Switchback Railway</a>).These days it&apos;s operated by Central Amusement International.</p>

<p>They&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130725071132/http://lunaparknyc.com/events/203-cyclone-rollercoaster-85th-birthday.html">celebrating tomorrow</a> old school-style, with 25 cent rides on the wooden thrill machine, but you&apos;ll need to get there early&#x2014;the discount only lasts the first 85 minutes after their noon opening (after that it&apos;s the standard 8 bucks).</p>

The cars, which are originals from 1927, are dismantled every winter before they undergo nondestructive testing and are reassembled.&quot;</p>

<p>In the below video, you&apos;ll see that people lose a lot on the coaster: from underwear to dentures!</p>
