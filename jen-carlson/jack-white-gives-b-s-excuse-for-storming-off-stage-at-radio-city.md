<span class="photo_caption">Chaos descended upon Radio City Music Hall at the end of Jack White&apos;s brief show (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022619/https://twitter.com/tomgam/status/252236413427388416">Tom Ganjamie</a>)</span></p>

<p>Remember when Jack White played a 45-minute set at Radio City Music Hall, before addressing the crowd with &quot;Jesus Christ, is this an NPR convention?&quot; and walking off the stage? The incident, which took place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022619/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/30/jack_white_enrages_fans_with_short.php">last September</a>, quietly dissipated with the passage of time, but now White has been pressed to give up some answers. </p>

<p>Rolling Stone questioned the musician what happened that night, and he basically blamed the audience while attempting to artfully dodge any sort of full reveal&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022619/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-jack-white-on-new-dead-weather-and-solo-tracks-radio-city-walkoff-20130226#ixzz2M21x3qm0">RS&apos;s Patrick Doyle asked</a>, &quot;I was at the Radio City show where you walked off... What was going through your head that night?&quot; White responded with the following:</p><blockquote>&quot;Oh, I just do what the crowd tells me to do. I always do that. I always have and always will. If I play an old folks&apos; home or a fire station, I shut up when the crowd tells me to shut up. I provoke when the crowd tells me to provoke. The crowd&apos;s in complete control of me. So that&apos;s, that&apos;s what will happen at any given night you see me. I was just doing what they told me to do [Laughs].&quot;</blockquote>Did Jack White play an old folks home and no one told us?<p></p>
