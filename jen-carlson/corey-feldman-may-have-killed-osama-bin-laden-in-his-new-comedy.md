<p>Corey Feldman, The Iron Sheik, Daniel Baldwin, and Frank Stallone are in a movie together that you probably would never have heard of if Osama bin Laden didn&apos;t die. <em>Huh?</em> According to the press release, sent out promptly after the historic moment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110504061612/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/president_obama_about_to_make_annou.php">was announced</a> by President Obama, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110504061612/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288367/"><em>Operation Belvis Bash</em></a> follows a &quot;Jewtastic&quot; comedian and two rock n&apos; rollers through their trip to Afghanistan, where they meet and presumably kill the world&apos;s most hated terrorist. The trailer pretty much says it all:</p>

<p><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6orEOF2uLIY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110504061612oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/6orEOF2uLIY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="390"></object></p>

<p>Feldman was premiering the movie in Texas when the big announcement aired on Sunday night, reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110504061612/http://www.movieweb.com/news/operation-belvis-bash-offers-surreal-premiere-for-corey-feldman">Movieweb</a>, and the actor promptly spinned the important moment into a way to promote his flick... and also a way to remind people that he had a special friendship with Michael Jackson. His statement read: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s absolutely unbelievable. I was in New York on September 11, 2001, with Michael Jackson, and then, nearly ten years later, I walk out of the premiere of my latest film, which I had postponed to be able to attend Corey Haim&#x2019;s <em>Decisions</em> premiere and memorial, to learn that Osama bin Laden had been killed by a special operation, just like in the film we&#x2019;d just screened. The timing is simply unbelievable, and whether life imitates art, or art imitates life...&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, let&apos;s stop at the part where Corey Feldman calls this movie &quot;art.&quot;</p>
