<p><em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em> hit the big screen yesterday, and as we know from the trailer, it tends to make the room you are in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103112446/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/new_extremely_loud_and_incredibly_c.php"><em>very dusty</em></a>. While everyone may be reaching for the Kleenex while watching the movie&#x2014;an adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer&apos;s novel about a boy who loses his father on September 11th&#x2014;a Lower Manhattan non-profit has issued a warning to survivors and family members of those who died that day. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103112446/http://www.tributewtc.org/index.php">The Tribute WTC Visitor Center</a> sent out an email before the movie&apos;s release saying it could trigger flashbacks. They wrote, &quot;If your intentions are to go and see this film, you should be prepared to possibly relive past issues or have difficulty handling those you have currently, due to [the] 9/11 attacks. Use your own discretion when deciding if this incredibly inspiring and moving film will give you an experience [that] we would want you to walk away with. Be prepared for a very sobering and real life experience.&quot; </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103112446/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111225/downtown/tom-hanks-new-911-film-could-spark-flashbacks-advocates-warn-email#ixzz1heaGqjzF">DNAInfo</a>, the movie&apos;s stars, Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks, visited the center before filming the movie, also taking a tour of the area with 9/11 survivors, victims&apos; families, and first responders. On their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103112446/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tribute-WTC-Visitor-Center/46813707682">Facebook page</a>, the center wrote:</p>

<blockquote>For some, this may hit too close to home, but if you have the opportunity to see the truly inspirational new film, <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em>, starring Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and a very talented young man by the name of Thomas Horn, you should take an afternoon.

<p>The Tribute Center&apos;s founders, Lee Ielpi and Jennifer Adams, had a heart-warming experience with Bullock and Hanks when they came on a Tribute walking tour before filming and Lee &amp; Jen just attended the preview for the film. They were incredibly moved by the film and how relationships and loss are portrayed in families affected by the 9/11 attacks.</p></blockquote><p></p>
