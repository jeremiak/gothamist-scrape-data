<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpGWKPArAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082324im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpGWKPArAM.jpg" width="350" height="222" class="image-left"> </span>Recently PETA splashed Michelle Obama&apos;s image all over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082324/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/ynews_ts1047">their Fur-Free ads</a> in D.C., without permission &#x2014;&#xA0;and now her husband&apos;s image is being used in an ad for a jacket company, also without White House approval.</p>

<p>Weatherproof Garment Company&apos;s billboard in Times Square features a photograph of the President on a recent trip to the Great Wall in China, where he&apos;s wearing one of their jackets. The ad declares: &quot;A Leader In Style.&quot; The White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082324/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/01/president-obama-used-in-jacket-ad-without-white-house-approval-.html">ABC News</a> that they have &quot;a longstanding policy disapproving of the use of the President&#x2019;s name and likeness for commercial purposes,&quot; and will be asking the company to remove the campaign.</p>

<p>However, Weatherproof president Freddie Stollmack says they will be keeping the billboard up, and on top of that, are looking for new spots to put additional ones. He says, &#x201C;we&#x2019;re not demonstrating that Obama is endorsing our product. We are just basically very happy to see that after 100 years we finally got a stylish president.&#x201D; And according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082324/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/brander_in_chief_z7vKQb9zrYsOtbtFJ4OmZO">the Post</a>, &quot;he thinks the White House should congratulate his company on making Obama look so good.&quot;</p>
