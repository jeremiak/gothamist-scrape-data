If only we could scratch together enough bread to fix a vintage one up, you know, stretch its legs on Route 66. But alas, as all dreams do, that dream has died. Right? Because the prices on these things are about to skyrocket with all the &quot;end of an era&quot; hype around them.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926204238/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_BRAZIL_END_OF_THE_VW_VAN?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">the AP</a>, the van was only still being made in Brazil, and now that &quot;safety regulations mandate that every vehicle in Brazil must have air bags and anti-lock braking systems starting in 2014, and the company says it cannot change production to meet the law.&quot; The Man and his laws, always such a bummer.
