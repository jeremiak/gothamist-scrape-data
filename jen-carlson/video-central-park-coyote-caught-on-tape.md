<p>The first time we heard of the Central Park coyote was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151449/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/central_park_coyote_on_the_loose.php">February 2nd</a>&#x2014;since then, there have been plenty of sightings of the little guy (and there may even be more than one roaming around out there). Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151449/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/09/coyote_craziness_continues.php">on the 9th</a>, the Parks Department had told us they plan to catch the coyote and... hopefully he won&apos;t meet the same end as Hal, who was caught in the area in 2006 and died in captivity.</p>

<p>For now, this latest coyote has managed to dodge The Man, but has posed a plenty for patient photographers. Most recently, Bruce at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151449/http://urbanhawks.blogs.com/urban_hawks/2010/02/coyote-continues-in-central-park.html">Urban Hawks</a> caught him on film after dropping by The Pond, located by Hallett Nature Sanctuary. He say it&apos;s &quot;an area free of the presence of dogs and humans... a perfect place for the Coyote to sleep during the day. The Coyote came out onto the ice four times.  It played with a bottle, went after some ducks, and eventually disappeared.  It seemed quite shy, hiding in the sanctuary between forays onto the ice.&quot;</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151449/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/05/central_park_coyote_spotted_again.php">we&apos;ve mentioned before</a>, this coyote really needs a name! Bruce at Urban Hawks suggests Urbana, as a tribute to Arthur C. Clarke. Or perhaps his moniker should be an homage to the late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151449/http://gothamist.com/tags/jdsalinger">J.D. Salinger</a>, who also enjoyed his solitude.</p>
