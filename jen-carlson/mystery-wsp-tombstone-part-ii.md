<span class="photo_caption">Washington Square Park in the 1880s, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510214833/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2009/04/29/henry-james-washington-square/">Ephemeral NY</a></span></p>

<p>Yesterday we noted that as renovations continue in Washington Square Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510214833/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/26/washington_square_park.php">a tombstone was unearthed</a> by workers. Considering there are about 20,000 dead bodies under there, this is much more mysterious than creepy.</p>

<p>The bodies are from when the site was a potter&apos;s field from 1797 to 1826, but potter&apos;s fields don&apos;t have tombstones. [Cue confused looks and suspense music.] Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510214833/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/21/michelle_james_nevius_authors_insid.php">the experts</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510214833/http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2009/10/washington-square-tombstone-unearthed.html">Inside the Apple</a> point out that only part of the park was a potter&apos;s field, however, and as Luther Harris writes in his book <em>Around Washington Square</em>:</p><blockquote>The land area [of the original square]...was about 6-1/4 acres, a respectable public space, but not a grand one. Much narrower than today&apos;s square, the potter&apos;s field was limited on the east by a strip of church cemeteries, and on the west by Minetta Creek, which ran southwest from the foot of Fifth Avenue to the corner of MacDougal and West Fourth Street.</blockquote>The site explains what was found last week <em>is</em> a tombstone, and possibly from a church graveyard; &quot;The Scotch Presbyterian Church owned the largest cemetery and vehemently opposed the park&apos;s usurpation of their land. Perhaps this is one of their brethren.&quot; As Freddy would say: Nice work Scoob!<p></p>
