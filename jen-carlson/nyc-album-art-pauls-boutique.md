With a Paul&apos;s Boutique sign hanging up on the Lee&apos;s Sportswear storefront, the shot was taken at 99 Rivington Street, where Rivington and Ludlow intersect. Currently residing in this exact spot is a restaurant called Paul&apos;s Boutique, named in honor of the album. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184919/http://www.juno.co.uk/covers/149959-02-front.htm">This shot looking down Rivington Street</a> from the intersection of Ludlow is also included in the album art (note the yellow street signs). On the left you can see the First Roumanian-American Congregation (89 Rivington Street) that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184919/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/01/22/breaking_temple.php">collapsed earlier this year</a>. Though it was 17 years ago, the area still has many a shop selling men&apos;s clothes, leather jackets and sportswear - with their product hanging out on the sidewalk, just like in this shot. </p>

<p>The Beastie Boys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184919/http://www.moire.com/beastieboys/samples/59chrystiestreet">first started practicing together at 59 Chrystie Street</a> (between Canal and Hester), just about nine blocks from &quot;Paul&apos;s Boutique&quot;. </p>
