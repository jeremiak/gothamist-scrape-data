<p>Brooklyn-based artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406032045/http://thought-processor.com/lastsupper/?p=1306">Glenda Reed</a> contacted us this morning explaining that she&apos;s embarking on an art project and working with a new medium: bread. There&apos;s just one giant problem; she explains:</p>

<blockquote>The sculpture, Bread Bed, is a wooden twin bed frame with a mattress of freshly baked bread that is meant to be eaten at the opening. The tricky part is that I&apos;d like to bake the bread mattress in one piece, roughly 6&apos; x 3&apos; x 5-8&quot;. I&apos;m having the darndest time finding an oven big enough... Do you have any suggestions where I might be able to find an oven large enough for this project? I&#x2019;d appreciate any advice regarding baking a loaf of bread this size in terms of recipes, cooking temperature, time, etc.</blockquote>

<p>So, anyone know where to find a mattress-sized oven? The piece will be shown, and eaten, at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406032045/http://thought-processor.com/lastsupper/">Last Supper Festival</a> next month&#x2014;the egg timer is ticking!</p>
