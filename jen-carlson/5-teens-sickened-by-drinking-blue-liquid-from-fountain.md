<p>Around 12:30 this afternoon we received reports that five kids fell ill from drinking blue liquid being dispensed from a water fountain at 75 Broad Street in Manhattan. The teenagers were inside of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161002/http://www.millenniumhs.org/">Millennium High School</a> at the time, and have since been transported to NYU Downtown Hospital. We were sent some photos from the scene, and will update when we receive more information. </p>
