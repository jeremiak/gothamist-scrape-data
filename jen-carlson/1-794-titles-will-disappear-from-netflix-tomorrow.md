<p>Tomorrow nearly 2,000 titles will be pulled from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235912/http://gothamist.com/tags/netflix">Netflix</a>, <em>never to return</em> (probably). The event has been dubbed Streamageddon, and here&apos;s why it&apos;s happening. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235912/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/04/30/netflix_queue_to_become_netflix_list_maybe_also_many_movies_no_longer_streaming.html">Slate</a> the libraries of Warner Bros., MGM, and Universal will &quot;become exclusive to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235912/http://instant.warnerarchive.com/">Warner Archive Instant</a>, the classic film service that officially launched earlier this month.&quot; (The streaming service is currently offering a free 2 week trial, and after that it&apos;s $9.99/month.)</p>

<p>Want to know what&apos;s being wiped from your queue? (Hopefully none of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235912/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/06/poopy_netflix.php#photo-1">these terribly awesome films</a>.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235912/http://instantwatcher.com/titles/expiring">InstantWatcher</a> has the very long list, totaling out at 1,794 titles&#x2014;it includes everything from <em>Octopussy</em> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235912/http://monstermoviekid.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/netflix-purge-results-in-a-shadow-double-feature/">The Shadow</a> to <em>all of the Barney titles</em> to the 1999 Adam Sandler classic <em>Big Daddy</em>.</p>
