Before getting to the impending reopening, let&apos;s start with the latter. In 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064747/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/nyregion/thecity/05feud.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">the NY Times</a> retold the story of a quarrel between the family behind both Long Island Restaurant and Montero&apos;s (still housed down the street). The former was run by Emma Sullivan: <p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;These two places are not related just by longevity or atmosphere, they are related by blood: Emma&apos;s brother was Joseph Montero, who ran the bar that bears his name until he retired to Spain in the late 1990&apos;s. He died soon after. Her sister-in-law, Pilar Montero, Joseph&apos;s widow, runs it still during the days, and spends much of her time sitting at her spot near the wall and chatting with customers.

<p>It&apos;s a long story, the story of Montero&apos;s and the Long Island Restaurant, a story of two stalwarts who have remained resolutely real amid all the pretense. It&apos;s also a story of family ties that do not quite bind&#x2014;not a feud but, rather, decades-old cases of mutual ambivalence. Some say the sisters-in-law haven&apos;t spoken for 50 years. There seems to be some bad blood about a grocery store on State Street that closed years ago, killed off by an uninvited highway.&quot;</p></blockquote>You&apos;ll want to read the entire long story&#x2014;but in the end, Long Island Restaurant quietly closed its doors in 2007. When it reopens&#x2014;presumably this year&#x2014;it will have shed the family fued, and most likely it will become a tribute to the former establishment in name and exterior only. After all, you can never go home again, and the area has started to attract a different crowd (one that enjoys craft cocktails down the street at Henry Public). It&apos;s also worth noting that one of the rumored new owners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064747/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2012/12/revivals_8.php">is Toby Cecchini</a>, the bartender &quot;often credited as the creator of the popular cosmopolitan cocktail.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Promisingly, however, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064747/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2013/04/long-island-restaurant.html">Craigslist ads</a> went up earlier this year, there was a nod to simplicity: &quot;We are restoring the Long Island Bar, an iconic corner spot in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. Operated by one family since the 1950s, the Long Island Bar is a neighborhood landmark.&quot; On top of a waitstaff, they were also seeking a chef who could create an uncomplicated menu that wasn&apos;t &quot;showy.&quot;</p>

<p>While the neon lights came back on earlier this month, this weekend passerby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064747/http://instagram.com/p/e0uoiiAxiy/">Conrad Doucette noticed</a> the lights on <em>inside the bar</em>, which was hosting &quot;a private party.&quot; We&apos;ll be sure to update when more solid details on an official reopening are unveiled.</p>
