										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpU7m2JePM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605135119im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpU7m2JePM.jpg" width="350" height="190" class="image-right"> </span>The papers have picked up on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605135119/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/08/summer_in_the_burg_dumpster_diving.php">dumpster diving</a> story and it turns out the location of the pool is in Gowanus. The address was actually decoded after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605135119/http://www.babelgum.com/3022110/new-urbanism-3-dumpster-pools.html">this video on the project</a> hit the internet last week, meaning people have been coming by and trying to sneak a peak at the private pools.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605135119/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/design/20pool.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">The NY Times</a> talked to a few lucky ones who have received a private invite to swing by. One woman who took a moonlit dip told them, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s amazing. It makes you wonder, as so many things in New York do, what&#x2019;s behind every wall that you can&#x2019;t see past.&#x201D; Heavy.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605135119/http://macro-sea.com/main.asp">The trio</a> who created the three dumpster oasis really went all out, cleaning them, adding a filtration system, lining them, and even building a little miniature urban beach club around them (complete with a changing cabana, lawn chairs and bocce ball). Sure, you aren&apos;t invited, but they said they&apos;d &quot;love maybe at some point to enlarge on this idea,&quot; and share it with more New Yorkers, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605135119/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/07/18/2009-07-18_dumpster_diving_youll_love_brooklyn_artists_transform_trash_bins_into_swimming_o.html">the Daily News</a>. And the organizers told the Times that they &quot;tried to do it so that even if you had to rent one, you could do a stand-alone Dumpster, a grill and chair for under $1,000.&#x201D; So what&apos;s stopping you? And if swimming isn&apos;t your thing, here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605135119/http://www.oliverbishopyoung.co.uk/conversions.html">an entire photo gallery</a> of ideas on how to make your own dumpster fun.</p>
