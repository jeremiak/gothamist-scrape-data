<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lethemj2001.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811103231im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lethemj2001.jpg" width="200" height="206" class="image-right"> </span>Brooklyn-born author Jonathan Lethem recently announced he&apos;d be leaving the borough to serve at his new post: the Roy Edward Disney Professor in Creative Writing at Pomona College in California, a position once held by David Foster Wallace. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811103231/http://www.nypl.org/audiovideo/jonathan-lethem-farewell-brooklyn">Last week</a> Lethem spoke about his departure at the New York Public Library (video below), and Marty Markowitz even commented upon it by telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811103231/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/writer_plots_an_exit_64e0y88e2NycknLM1lrZVN#ixzz113nf5CLP">the NY Post</a>: &quot;maybe he&apos;ll miss the Gowanus Canal and come back to us when he gets tired of La-La Land.&quot; Yep, we hear the first thing people miss when they leave Brooklyn is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811103231/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/27/video_gowanus_canal_will_consume_us.php">raw-sewage flowing</a> in that long-polluted body of water.</p>

<p>While the borough has often showed up in Lethem&apos;s novels, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811103231/http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/ultimate-betrayal-jonathan-lethem-writes-about-queens">New York Observer</a> reports today that Queens is the setting for his next! At the aforementioned talk at the library, Lethem does mention that his mother was from Queens.</p>
