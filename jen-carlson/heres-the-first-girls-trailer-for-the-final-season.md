title: Here's The First 'Girls' Trailer For The Final Season
---

	
										<p>For those interested in a brief 100 seconds of escapism, the first trailer for the final season of HBO&apos;s <em>Girls</em> has been released, ahead of the first episode airing on February 12th. Just like the rest of us, everyone is still trying to figure their shit out, but this time around Marnie is with Ray, Jessa is more officially with Adam, Shoshanna doesn&apos;t have friends with purses or something? And Hannah appears to be a published writer.</p>

<p>In 2015, it was reported that Dunham&apos;s next project would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314075711/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/13/lena_dunham_hbo_max.php"><em>Max</em></a>, a series set in 1963 that revolves around &quot;the stirrings of second-wave feminism, as seen through the eyes of an ambitious magazine writer who stumbles her way into the women&#x2019;s movement.&quot;</p>
