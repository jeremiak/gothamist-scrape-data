<p>The historic Lehigh Valley Railroad Barge Number 79, docked in Red Hook and sometimes seen getting tugged off the coast, is turning 100 years old next year&#x2014;and with the anniversary will come a year of special events under the umbrella name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090725/http://www.barge100.org/">BARGE 100</a>. These events will start in May of 2014, but before all that there will be a Pirate Ball hosted by the Waterfront Museum.<br>
 <br>
The Pirate Ball is coming on September 19th, and will be held aboard the historic barge. There will be entertainment as well as specialty cocktails, hors d&apos;oeuvres, a silent auction, and some pretty classic sunset views. All proceeds from the Ball, and next year&apos;s events, will benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090725/http://www.waterfrontmuseum.org/">the Waterfront Museum Barge</a>. A little history lesson from the event organizers:<br>
 <br>
</p><blockquote>&quot;Built in 1914, the Number 79 represents the only surviving all-wooden example of the Hudson River Railroad Barge from the Lighterage Age (1860-1960) that remains afloat and is accessible to the general public.  The Barge, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is a rarity based not only upon her historical significance and social impact, but also upon her pristine state of preservation.<p></p>

<p>In 1986, Captain David Sharps founded the Waterfront Museum aboard the Barge to promote understanding of New York Harbor&#x2019;s maritime history and its importance to the commercial, cultural and recreational life of the city and the world.  Since 1994, the Museum and Barge have been docked in Red Hook, Brooklyn and have become both a neighborhood landmark and a source of pride for the community.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090725/http://www.waterfrontmuseum.org/lehigh-valley-79">the Lehigh Valley No. 79</a> is the only surviving all-wooden Hudson River Railroad Barge from the Lighterage Age (1860-1960) that remains not only afloat, but open to the public. So why not party on it...</p>
