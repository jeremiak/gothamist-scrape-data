With Canada Day happening tomorrow, Pat gave us some fresh tips (below) on how to celebrate his native land right here in New York City. You&apos;ll even have a chance to celebrate with Pat himself! <p></p>

<p><strong>TOMORROW there will be a contest</strong> which you can enter two ways: Pat will be throwing some trivia questions at you via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/https://twitter.com/#!/patkiernan">his Twiter</a> tomorrow <strong>at 11:30 a.m.</strong>, and we&apos;ll be posting a question on this site as well (follow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/https://twitter.com/#!/gothamist">our Twitter</a> to get the alert in the morning). The past two years <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/20/ny1s_pat_kiernan_takes_gothamist_re.php#photo-1">we&apos;ve indulged</a> in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/poutine.php#photo-1">poutine dinner</a>, and this year the winners will join us and Pat for some Canadian beer and Montreal bagels later this month (date to be announced)! </p>

<p><u><strong>5 Ways New Yorkers Can Celebrate Canada</strong></u></p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Look up on June 30th: The Empire State Building usually turns on the red and white lights on July 1st for Canada Day, but this year they&#x2019;re doing it a day early, on the night of Thursday June 30th. (Starting Friday, they&#x2019;re committed to the red, white and blue for the Independence Day weekend.)</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Find some Canadian food and drink: The midtown restaurant and bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://windfallnyc.com/">Windfall</a> has figured out that it&#x2019;s good for business to embrace Canadian ex-pats. Windfall hosts &#x201C;Hockey Night in NYC&#x201D; every Saturday during the NHL&#x2019;s season and has a special Canada Day lunch menu for Friday. Canadian-born chef David Cioppa will prepare PEI Mussels, Digby Lobster and BC Mushroom Focaccia.</p>

<p>Alternatives: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://nymag.com/listings/bar/ontario-bar/">Ontario Bar</a> in Brooklyn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://www.lepescadeux.com/">La Pescadeux</a> in SoHo, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://www.mileendbrooklyn.com/">Mile End Deli</a> in Boerum Hill all have strong Canadian connections  and menu options to support their northern roots.</p>

<p>Sadly, I can&#x2019;t recommend that you visit one of the New York branches of Canada&#x2019;s iconic donut chain Tim Hortons. They&#x2019;ve botched their NYC expansion and the quality of the food is not nearly up to the high standards of the company&#x2019;s bustling Canadian stores.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> See Green Lantern: Use Canada as your excuse to go see hunky Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern. He was born in Vancouver and gets extra Canadian points because his father is a retired Mountie.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Watch the Canada Day fireworks: Ideally, you&#x2019;d view the Canada Day fireworks on the night of July 1st in Ottawa, the Canadian capital city. (A 7&#xBD;  hour drive.)  But, conveniently, many communities closer to New York have realized it&#x2019;s silly to compete with the Macy&#x2019;s 4th of July fireworks, so they&#x2019;ve offset their local fireworks events to Friday, July 1st. New Jersey Transit will gladly transport you to Paterson, where the stealth Canada Day celebration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://bestofnj.com/nj-fireworks-guide/">begins at 6:30 pm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Sing &#x201C;O Canada&#x201D; with me at Joe&#x2019;s Pub: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315053840/http://www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,3993">Joe&#x2019;s Pub</a> teams up with the Canadian Consulate each July 1st to celebrate Canadian music.  A talented lineup of musicians will perform favorites in the Great Canadian Songbook shows at 6:30 pm and 9:00 pm. And I&#x2019;ll kick off both shows by leading the singing of the Canadian national anthem.</p>
