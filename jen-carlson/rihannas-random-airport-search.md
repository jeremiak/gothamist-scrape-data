title: Rihanna's Random Airport Search
---

	
										<p>Yesterday on her way from Los Angeles to New York, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145101/http://gothamist.com/tags/rihanna">Rihanna</a> was the subject of a random security search at LAX. The random selection had her out in the open stripping down to a T-backed tank top, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145101/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/peeved_pop_singer_puts_on_show_at_d5cyed2ghmyINIbvNWB2AO">the NY Post</a>, &quot;it gave airport gawkers an eyeful of her body and the tattoo that runs down her back.&quot; The singer reportedly looked cold and unhappy. She&apos;s now safe and sound in NYC&#x2014;performing at Hammerstein Ballroom last night, and slated as the musical guest on tomorrow&apos;s SNL.</p>
