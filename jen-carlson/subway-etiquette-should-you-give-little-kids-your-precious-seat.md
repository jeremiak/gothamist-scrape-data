title: Subway Etiquette: Should You Give Little Kids Your Precious Seat?

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="subwaykids.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135616im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/subwaykids.jpg" width="640" height="440" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Spotted on the subway this morning: Cruella Deville reading some vapid glossy magazine article (probably) and intentionally (probably) ignoring these doe-eyed, sleepy-headed children who walked right out of a goddamn Norman Rockwell painting and just wanted to rest their tired tiny legs before a long day of playing and napping and daydreaming about fantastical and wonderful worlds that they will soon find out don&apos;t exist.</p>

<p>Listen, no one really knows what&apos;s going on here or if these kids even wanted to sit, but the tipster who sent this photo didn&apos;t paint a pretty picture:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This morning on the 2 train... This horrible woman saw these 2 little kids needed a seat, and just sat there keeping on with her magazine. Kids really looked like they wanted a seat, but she kept ignoring them. Wearing horrible zebra print leggings too.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>While zebra print leggings are certainly questionable, they are off-topic and unrelated (but she actually seems like she is pulling them off!). Let&apos;s talk human decency: Is this woman <em>really</em> &quot;horrible&quot; for not giving her seat to two children? Isn&apos;t there some sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135616/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> rule that you give seats to your elders? Upon seeing the photo, Gothamist staffers weighed in:<br>
</p><ul><li>&quot;Are you supposed to give kids seats? They&apos;re so much younger than us!&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135616/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen Carlson</a><br>
</li><li>&quot;I don&apos;t give kids my seat. They can barely sit still to begin with! I&apos;ll let the mom sit if she displays good parenting skills, but those kids can STAND.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135616/http://twitter.com/JohnDelSignore">John Del Signore</a><br>
</li><li>&quot;I always give up my seat to parents attempting to wrangle several children. Otherwise, I employ a complicated algorithm of the child&apos;s age/spryness weighed against how hungover I am.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135616/http://twitter.com/laurenfaceevans">Lauren Evans</a></li><li> &quot;No. If a woman is holding a child then I would let her sit, but kids? They haven&apos;t had the knee surgeries that I have. Let &apos;em stand.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135616/https://twitter.com/JJSteele3">Josh Steele</a> <br>
</li><li>&quot;I can&apos;t even begin to imagine the kind of sociopathic narcissism that would allow an uncrippled adult to sit there reading while two small children are bounced to and fro by a moving subway car! Their little arms can&apos;t even reach the poles!&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135616/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a></li></ul><p></p>

<p>Relevant note: One of these staffers has children, the others do not.</p>
