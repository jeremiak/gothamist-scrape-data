<p>The leaves are dying and it&apos;s beautiful. </p>

<p>Peak foliage colors are currently creeping across New York State, and will soon reach the NYC-area. At the moment, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090026/http://www.iloveny.com/seasons/fall/foliage-report/#.VhwOgLRVhHw">I Love NY&apos;s fall foliage watch</a>, &quot;color change is around 10 percent on Long Island and 5 percent in New York City,&quot; where there are reports from Pelham Bay Park in The Bronx of &quot;emerging patches of red and yellow, along with brown edges on some of the leaves.&quot; </p>

<p>The leaves are also changing in Brooklyn, but for now they&apos;re really more Twitter-worthy than they are Instagram-worthy, the gold standard for sharing quality photos via social media.</p>

<p>Typically, the 5 boroughs will see a fall foliage peak happen during the last week of October and first week of November, and that remains true <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090026/http://www.nyfallfoliage.com/">this year</a>. So you have another week or so to find yourself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090026/http://www.theonion.com/article/mr-autumn-man-walking-down-street-with-cup-of-coff-29866">an Autumn Boyfriend</a>, recreate the below photo, and bask in the beautiful brisk weather before everything turns bleak.</p>
