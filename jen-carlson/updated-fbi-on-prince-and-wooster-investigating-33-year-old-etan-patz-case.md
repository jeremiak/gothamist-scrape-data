A tipster sent over the above photo, which shows what looks like a lot of younger, junior agents. There is also an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/http://lockerz.com/s/202497140">Evidence Response truck</a> on the scene. The FBI wouldn&apos;t comment on the case when we contacted them this morning. </p>

<p>One person in SoHo told us that the &quot;entire street, plus bike lanes, are barricaded, [they] wouldn&apos;t let people pass on sidewalk.&quot;  At least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/http://itinerantdaughter.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/breaking-news/">one rumor</a> we&apos;re hearing is that the team is at Lucky Jeans because &quot;someone just confessed to murdering a child in 1968 and burying his/her body in the basement.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve got someone on the scene now, and will try to confirm what&apos;s going on. Stay tuned for updates.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This is in regards to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/etan_patzs_1979_disappearance_in_so.php">33-year-old Etan Patz case</a>&#x2014;the FBI has now released a statement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/04/19/authorities-resume-search-of-home-in-etan-patz-case/">saying</a>, &#x201C;The FBI and the NYPD are looking for evidence in the Etan Patz investigation. It&#x2019;s one of many leads that we&#x2019;re pursuing. It is a joint matter between the FBI and NYPD and no conclusions should be made about specifically why we&#x2019;re here or what we&#x2019;re looking for.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/http://nymag.com/news/features/56441/">Patz was kidnapped</a> from lower Manhattan when he was 6 years old, on May 25th, 1979. He is one of most famous missing child in NYC&#x2014;he was also the first child to be pictured on the side of a milk carton.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (11:18 a.m.):</strong> Officials on the scene have confirmed this in regards to human remains, and that they will be there for 2 to 3 days, at least.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (2 p.m.):</strong> There are currently mumblings at the scene on Prince Street that a cadaver dog was brought in. The NYPD and FBI aren&apos;t currently commenting, but according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/https://twitter.com/#!/JoeyBoots">Joey Boots</a>, who is there, there is some activity under the evidence tents. He also says, &quot;legit scoop from a very reliable source... cadaver dog signaled a hit in basement and now they are digging.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (5 p.m.):</strong> Patz&apos;s parents still live down the street from where the FBI is set up right now. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/http://nancygrace.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/19/new-etan-patz-search-focuses-on-basement-near-home/?hpt=ng_mid">CNN</a>, the search effort is focused in a basement at 127B Prince Street&#x2014;a 13&#x2019; x 62&#x2019; space with a cement floor. Gothamist contributer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194416/https://twitter.com/#!/nellcasey">Nell Casey</a> was on the scene earlier, and reports back, &quot;the space is empty now but a neighbor who I spoke to recalls that it was some kind of ironworking place. The neighbor also said police had been interviewing people recently in the neighborhood about the abduction.&quot;</p>

<p>As of this time, the FBI still plans on being there for two more days.</p>
