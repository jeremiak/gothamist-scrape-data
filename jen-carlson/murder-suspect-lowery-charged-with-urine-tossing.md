                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0110nativialowery.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004031619im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0110nativialowery.jpg" width="240" height="190" class="image-left"> </span>While awaiting jury selection to be completed for her trial, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004031619/http://gothamist.com/tags/natavialowery">Natavia Lowery</a> is getting into <em>more</em> trouble behind bars. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004031619/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/stein_slay_gal_po_da_GY8uYZhf7pBWOSbjIBisBI">The NY Post</a> reports that she now faces felony charges for tossing a large container of urine (and &quot;some solid material&quot;) in the face of a Rikers correction officer. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old now awaits arraignment in the Bronx under aggravated harassment and obstruction charges. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004031619/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/01/15/2010-01-15_realtor_slay_susp_in_rikers_jam.html">the Daily News</a>, the pee attack happened on January 2nd, and involved two other female inmates as well. A law enforcement official told the paper, &quot;It smelled like urine.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Meanwhile</em>, regarding her trial for the alleged bludgeoning murder of Linda Stein, she has made a request! Lowery has asked that Stein&apos;s daughters, Mandy and Samantha, not be allowed in the courtroom &#x2014; however, trial judge, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers, said banning them would be unnecessary and &quot;extraordinarily sad.&quot;</p>

<p>According to reports, the pee attack could land her up to 4 years behind bars... and the murder could get her 25 to life.</p>
