<p>We&apos;ve been watching how the inaugural 4Knots Festival (which is essentially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225253/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/siren_fest_cancelled_new_village_vo.php">the new Siren Festival</a>) has been shaping up. So far organizers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225253/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/the_black_angels_to_headline_south.php">have announced</a> Davila 666, Oberhofer, and the Black Angels for the show, which will take place at South Street Seaport&apos;s Pier 17 on July 16th. And today they announced the headliner for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225253/http://www.seaportmusicfestival.com/index.php/news/entry/hes_back/">their kick-off show</a> on July 9th (drum roll please): Ted Leo and the Pharmacists! </p>

<p>Everyone loves Ted Leo, including us, but... remember that summer that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225253/http://gothamist.com/tags/jackjohnson">Jack Johnson</a> was booked at every single festival and it was a little bit too much (nevermind, this isn&apos;t really a fair comparison, because any Jack Johnson is really too much Jack Johnson). Anyway, the Village Voice made their announcement today saying, &quot;it should come as no surprise that Ted Leo and the Pharmacists will headline The Official 4Knots Music Festival Kick Off Show.&quot; And you know what, they are correct: it <em>doesn&apos;t</em> come as a surprise, because everyone books Ted Leo at every festival ever, always. Especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715225253/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/25/a_brief_history_1.php">summer outdoor concerts</a> in New York City. </p>

<p>So do concert bookers need to try harder... or does New York need some better musicians? Because Ted Leo is amazing, but he can&apos;t be the only one holding up this mist tent.</p>
