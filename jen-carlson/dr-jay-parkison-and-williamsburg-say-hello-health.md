Now he is launching a franchise operation, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619030514/http://hellohealth.com/">Hello Health</a>, with the first outlet opening in Williamsburg later this month.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619030514/http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/06/09/technodoc-jay-parkinson-says-hello-to-franchising/">The WSJ</a> checked in with the good doctor last month, and he got in to the intricacies of the franchise.</p><blockquote>Hello Health is a neighborhood-based, Internet-enabled practice that sees you in person and communicates with you over the Internet. Patients become members for a Netflix-priced monthly fee and then pay fee for service. In-person visits, whether house call or in-office, will range from $75 to $150 cash. We will submit your claim to your insurance for you so you can be reimbursed but you pay cash up front.</blockquote>He also noted that they&apos;ll be doing about 80% of their visits at the patients&#x2019; homes, but the &quot;in store&quot; procedures are reserved for those that aren&#x2019;t appropriate for the home. Parkinson gets more in to details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619030514/http://blog.jayparkinsonmd.com/post/28073454/say-hello-to-hello-health-launching-july-15th">on his blog</a>.<p></p>
