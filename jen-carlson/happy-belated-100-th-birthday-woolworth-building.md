<p>Dear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://gothamist.com/tags/woolworthbuilding">Woolworth Building</a>, </p>

<p>How was your 100th birthday? Are you hungover? Did you do a lot of reflecting last night? You know what they say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">nostalgia is death</a>. Anyway, don&apos;t you just HATE how New York City has changed in the last century? Nothing really looks like you anymore. And you&apos;ve got a Starbucks lodged inside you, just like everyone else.</p>

<p>And can you believe how hyped up Brooklyn is these days? BROOKLYN! Jesus.  </p>

<p>But seriously do you just feel like a stranger in a strange place now? Sometimes are you just like, &quot;Listen motherfuckers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://www.history.com/topics/woolworth-building">I was financed in CA$H</a>! My lobby was created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://nycarchitecture.columbia.edu/0242_2/0242_2_s5_7_text.html">by artists and sculptors</a>. There is a marble sculpture of myself <em>inside of myself</em>. And I don&apos;t let just <em>anyone</em> onto my observation deck, that shit is <em>not easy</em> to get on to. Did I mention I have a pool... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=5792">I don&apos;t even use it</a>!&quot; </p>

<p>Do you ever tell the other buildings the story about how on April 24th, 1913 you &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://www.skyscraper.org/EXHIBITIONS/WOOLWORTH/WWat100PR.pdf">illuminated the New York night</a>&quot; with 80,000 incandescent bulbs all over your tower, and how those bulbs were <em>activated by President Woodrow Wilson</em>? What was he like?!</p>

<p>Sometimes do you look over and say, &quot;I&apos;mma let you finish One World Trade Center, but I was the tallest building IN THE WORLD for 17 years!&quot; (Right? That Kanye gag never gets old! Just like yoooouuu.) Do you just look down on the others and say, &quot;I&apos;ve touched actual CLOUDS. Call me when you&apos;ve felt Heaven with your spire or LOL flat boring <em>roof</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you the most narcissistic building in our skyline? You are, aren&apos;t you? It&apos;s cool, we hate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://www.flickr.com/photos/913street/5492491173/">Frank Gehry</a>, too. And you&apos;re really pretty, inside and out.</p>

<p>Seriously, even your guts are cool looking...</p>

<p>Are you blushing? That&apos;s so cute and old fashioned. Buildings these days are sort of emotionally unavailable assholes, just cold as steel. And they&apos;re not even <em>nearly</em> as interesting as you! Sorry, you must get this all the time. It&apos;s just nice when a building has a little soul.</p>

<p>So, apologies about the belated greeting, we would have left a Happy Birthday message on your Facebook wall but you haven&apos;t accepted our friendship yet. No it&apos;s fine, we know you&apos;re busy just being you and all. And please, keep being you&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111601/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/07/woolworth_building_to_become_luxury.php">don&apos;t let those rich douchebags change you</a>.</p>

<p>Love, </p>

<p>Gothamist</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry you&apos;re not in our logo. MAJOR oversight.</p>
