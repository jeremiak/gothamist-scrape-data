The artist behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170622/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_Bull">Charging Bull</a> sculpture near Wall Street is suing Random House for using an image of his work for the cover art of a book about the fall of Lehman Brothers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170622/http://www.1010wins.com/Artist-Sues-over-Wall-St---Bull--Sculpture-on-Book/4900850">1010Wins</a> reports that Arturo Di Modica was filing the lawsuit in federal court yesterday, and seeking unspecified damages. He is also asking the picture be removed from the book, titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170622/http://www.amazon.com/Colossal-Failure-Common-Sense-Collapse/dp/0307588335//?tag=gothamist03-20">A Colossal Failure of Common Sense</a>.&quot; Indeed, he had the sculpture copyrighted in 1998, 9 years after its creation. Maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170622/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadpanda">Sad Panda</a> can go on the new cover!</p>
