<p>The One Where Someone Makes A Montage Video Of An Old Sitcom! Yep, someone has made a supercut from old episodes of <em>Friends</em>, which they call &quot;a veracious montage&quot; that &quot;sheds new light on homophobic attitudes in contemporary TV culture.&quot; But was <em>Friends</em> really homophobic? There was a lesbian character (Ross&apos;s ex-wife) <em>and</em> a cross-dressing father (played by Kathleen Turner)! The montage includes clips with quotes like:</p><ul><li>&quot;This was Carol&apos;s favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.&quot; &#x2014; Ross on his lesbian ex-wife<br>
</li><li>&quot;You&apos;re smart, and funny... you just, you have a quality.&quot; &#x2014; on people thinking Chandler is gay<br>
</li><li>&quot;I just picked up a message from Emily. She and Susan are going to a poetry reading together. Poetry! Susan&apos;s gay. They&apos;re being gay together!&quot; &#x2014; Ross worried about his new girlfriend turning lesbian</li></ul>If only they had added a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233113/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPcGapl2dM">not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that</a>!&quot; The video runs a whopping <em>fifty minutes</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233113/http://www.buzzfeed.com/jpmoore/epic-super-cut-of-every-gay-joke-friends-ever-di">Buzzfeed</a> notes that some of the jokes (of which there are clearly a lot) are homophobic, and mostly &#x201C;no homo&#x201D; moments between Chandler and Joey. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233113/http://bitchmagazine.org/post/ill-be-there-for-you-but-not-in-a-gay-way-homophobic-friends">Bitch Magazine</a> previously brought up that there could also be a &quot;whole series of videos, like Misogynistic Friends and Xenophobic Friends,&quot; and that &quot;Homophobic Friends [is not an] attempt to ridicule the underlying homophobia, but rather strives to bring this attitude to the viewer&#x2019;s attention in all of its apparent normality.&quot;<p></p>
