<p>Has anyone lost a well dressed, bilingual elephant in Brooklyn? Babar, yes <em>that</em> Babar, has been discovered in Bay Ridge, and his new human friends have posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161631/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/laf/2724446445.html">this alert on Craigslist</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Found on the evening of Saturday 11/26 on 73rd Street. Royal, well-dressed, bilingual (French/English) elephant would like to go home. He is fond of good cakes, dromedaries and hot-air ballooning. Is he yours?</blockquote>

<p>Babar has already lost his mother (shot by a hunter), so hopefully his new human family will claim him soon. Though don&apos;t worry, Babar (even if he is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161631/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/the-80th-anniversary-of-babar/">80 years old</a>) is well acclimated with big city living&#x2014;just so long as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161631/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/22/peta_has_video_of_ringling_bros_bea.php">the Ringling Bros. crew</a> doesn&apos;t claim him.</p>
