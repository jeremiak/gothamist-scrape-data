										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="batmanfalling06.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161315im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/batmanfalling06.jpeg" width="350" height="201" class="image-right"> </span>A group of physics students from overseas have come out with shocking realities about Batman, just one week before the <em>Dark Knight Rises</em> hits the big screen. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161315/https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/484/289">Thanks, nerds</a>! The University of Leicester students say that Batman would die if he tried to fly using a cape&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161315/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-18780929">the BBC</a>, &quot;they used formulas to calculate how effective the 4.69m (15.4ft) wide cape used in <em>Batman Begins</em> would be.&quot;</p>

<p>They conclude their paper saying, &quot;clearly gliding using a batcape is not a safe way to travel,&quot; but it seems a few adjustments would make things go smoother. They note that flying would be made easier with a <em>larger</em> cape, even though Batman would die upon landing: &quot;He can get about twice as far as he does fall, but once he gets there he is travelling about 50mph and that&apos;s a bit too fast to land safely. He would likely end up getting a bit splattered.&quot;</p>

<p>Further research showed that, &quot;If you increase the wingspan, once it gets towards the size of a glider it&apos;s going to start working. With a few adaptations it would be fine.&quot; So then a batcape <em>would</em> be safe? We&apos;re so confused! What does CD &#x2248; 0:4 stand for again?
