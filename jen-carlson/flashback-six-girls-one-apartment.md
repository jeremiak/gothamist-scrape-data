</div></div>					<p>We stumbled upon a huge collection of these photos for LIFE magazine, all captioned with things like: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613102241/http://images.google.com/images?q=six+girls&amp;q=source%3Alife&amp;biw=1743&amp;bih=847">Six girls for cover</a>,&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613102241/http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;biw=1743&amp;bih=847&amp;tbs=isch%3A1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=6+girls+source%3Alife&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=">6 Girls In Apt</a>,&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613102241/http://images.google.com/images?sa=4&amp;imgc=&amp;imgsz=&amp;q=6+Girls+In+2+Room+Apt+source%3Alife&amp;biw=1743&amp;bih=847">6 Girls In 2 Room Apt</a>&quot;&#x2014;you get the idea. Basically what we have here is six young women living in a two room apartment in Greenwich Village; most of the photos were taken in January and February of 1954. But <em>what is this</em>? While there are plenty of photographs documenting their adventure (presumably for a LIFE spread), there are also television cameras in a couple of shots... though it doesn&apos;t appear anyone had the foresight to turn this into a reality show (it would have been the first!).</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted LIFE for more details on these ladies, and will update if we get more info. In the meantime, feel free to enlighten us in the comments.</p>
