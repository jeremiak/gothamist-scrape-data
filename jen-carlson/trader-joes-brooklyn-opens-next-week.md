Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124313/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/37/31_37_mm_trader.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports it will be opening in the landmark Independence Bank building as soon as next week! September 26th, to be exact. &quot;The supermarket will open at 9 am and the festivities will feature giveaways, live music,&quot; and of course, more Markowitz. But be warned winos, this location at the corner of Atlantic Avenue and Court Street will not have Two-Buck Chuck, or any wine at all.</p>
