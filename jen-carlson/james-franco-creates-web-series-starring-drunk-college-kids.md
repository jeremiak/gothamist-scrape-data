<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003902/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> is back on Twitter, it seems, with his newly created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003902/https://twitter.com/#!/JamesFrancoTV">James Franco TV</a> handle. <em>That is, if it&apos;s really James Franco who&apos;s behind this.</em> IF it is, it would appear the everyman is getting into the television biz, or more specifically, the web series biz (though surely this is <em>art</em>). Anyway, we have little information about this project, but Franco Tweeted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003902/http://www.jamesfrancotv.com/videos/119098">a link to it</a> yesterday, saying, &quot;my new show,&quot; which is called <em>Undergrads</em>.</p>

<p>The two and a half minute trailer, soundtracked by Omaha band Tilly &amp; The Wall, seems to be filmed at USC (where he is or was a student or professor? We honestly can&apos;t remember.). Is it real, is it scripted? Do college kids really have bucket lists? Will there be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003902/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/james_franco_graduates_again.php">an NYU version</a>? Has James Franco been knighted yet? And most importantly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003902/http://www.jamesfrancotv.com/photos/120508">whose cat is this</a>?</p>
