title: 1991 Video Shows NYC Drivers Dealing With 'Kamikaze Pedestrians' & More
---

	
										<p>In 1991, the TV news show <em>48 Hours</em> dedicated about twenty minutes to the perils of driving in NYC: from getting towed, to getting a license to drive a taxi, to <em>driving</em> the taxi, to maneuvering the streets as an ambulance driver. And as one man puts it, there are a lot of obstacles in the streets: &quot;You&apos;ve got vans cutting in front of you, you&apos;ve got New Jersey drivers, kamikaze pedestrians jumping out like rabbits all over the place... bikers zooming by, you gotta watch these bikers.&quot;</p>

<p>Did Larry&#x2014;the Russian who only spent 12 hours behind the wheel in his entire life&#x2014;really become a taxi driver? Did Andre ever get his big break in the comedy world? Was that rich guy&apos;s Rolls Royce getting towed <em>really</em> &quot;a travesty of justice&quot;? Did Woody Allen ever put that line in his next picture? We&apos;ll never know.</p>
