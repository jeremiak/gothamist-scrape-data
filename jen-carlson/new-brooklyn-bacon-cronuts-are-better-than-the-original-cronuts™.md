<span class="photo_caption">There&apos;s a new Fauxnut in town. (Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>While Fort Greene&apos;s Le Petit Bakery is calling these things &quot;Squats&quot; (<em>no one wants to think about exercise when escaping into a pastry!</em>), their sign outside definitely advertises them as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">CRONUTS</a>. And they are, basically, square Cronuts&#x2122;. They are also just about the best damn Cronut&#x2122; imitation we&apos;ve tasted to date (and we&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/25/taste_testing_the_fauxnut.php">tried many</a>). </p>

<p>We were tipped off to the latest version of the croissant-donut hybrid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130708/fort-greene/cronut-craze-reinvented-at-le-petit-bakery-on-myrtle-avenue-fort-greene">by DNAInfo</a>, which reported that the pastry is &quot;shaped like a square but they still have the signature crispy, buttery insides of a croissant and deep-fried outside of a donut.&quot; Sold. We headed over there this morning.</p>

<p>The bakery charges $4 per Squat, and they make about 50 a day&#x2014;usually running out around 11 a.m. There&apos;s no limit as to how many you can purchase at a time&#x2014;we picked up five (3 bacon maple with chocolate filling, 2 sprinkled ones with vanilla filling), and there was no wait whatsoever. The verdict? Delicious!</p>

<ul><li>&quot;The first thing I ask myself after I finish a pastry is Why are you such a pastry whore? The second is, &apos;Do I want more of this?&apos; These were sweet and pleasantly chewy, but most importantly it left me wanting more. The original Cronut&#x2122; was too overbearing, too clingy. I didn&apos;t want to see or call that Cronut&#x2122; and I sure as hell didn&apos;t want to bump into it at some club in the Hamptons. This faux-nut struck a nice balance.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a>
</li><li>&quot;After having the original and two different fauxnuts, this one is giving real Cronut a challenge. Denser&#x2014;feels more doughnut-like, with a crunchier outside and fluffier inside. Bacon is barely noticeable in a good way, and Nutella (right?) is tasty. Seems like it&apos;d be too busy but it works. Feels less Cronutty, more crossiant doughnut-y&#x2014;behaves like it&apos;s own, different, person.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/https://twitter.com/marc_yearsley">Marc Yearsley</a>
</li><li>&quot;I&apos;m not huge on the &apos;bacon must be on all the things&apos; trend, so I was dubious, but this pastry was actually pretty good compared to other bacon-laden things I&apos;ve tried recently. The bacon flavor was subtle&#x2014;some might say subtle to the point of not needing to be there?&#x2014;and at least the bits were cooked well and not fatty and chewy. Overall, I really dug the flavor and the texture of this fauxnut. The pastry itself was tender and crispy without falling apart and the chocolate filling had a luscious, not-too-sweet flavor. I&apos;d get this over a regular Cronut for sure.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://twitter.com/nellcasey">Nell Casey</a>
</li><li>&quot;As I bit into the bacon one, there was this warm, greasy splooge explosion that turns out to be warm chocolate filling.  But it was like, whoa, brother, a warning would have been nice.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a>
</li><li>&quot;I would just like to use this space to say that someone needs to invent a Cronut Hole, because these things are really messy when you try to split them up between coworkers.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen Carlson</a></li></ul>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191635/http://lepetitbakery.com/">Le Petit Bakery</a> is located at 354 Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn... and we&apos;re told their next fauxnut is going to be Almond Joy flavored.</p>
