<p>The greatest sub-genre of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706182712/http://gothamist.com/tags/bartspeople">Feel Good Reporting</a> is definitely the stories that come from finding old photos or letters belonging to a stranger. Typically this happens when someone is renovating or cleaning their own home, and stumble upon an old treasure trove of someone else&apos;s past. The word spreads through social media, connections are made, and we all feel a little something when the photos are eventually returned to the people in them, or their surviving family members. </p>

<p>Enter Megan and Bobby Kapsidis of Florida, who recently discovered the circa-1963 wedding album of Marguerite and Joseph Gargiulo (which fell from the ceiling right after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706182712/https://www.facebook.com/megan.deporter/posts/10155825815460616?pnref=story">a 1940s alligator purse</a>). The album appears to have belonged to the parents of the bride or groom, with the words &#x201C;Our Children&#x2019;s Wedding&#x201D; on the cover, but it&apos;s possible the couple in the photos also lived in Florida at some point, despite getting married in New York City.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706182712/http://pix11.com/2017/06/05/florida-couple-finds-new-yorkers-wedding-album-from-1963-in-their-ceiling/">PIX11 News</a>, the Kapsidis &quot;found a phone number and Florida address for the bride,&quot; but the Gargiulos were no longer living there, so now they&apos;re looking to spread the word in hopes of finding them. As of this afternoon, Megan Kapsidis told us &quot;unfortunately there&apos;s no new information right now.&quot;</p>

<p>You can click through the photos in the below Facebook post to see the album, which shows the wedding took place on September 14, 1963 at St. Thomas Apostle Church (87th Street and 88th Avenue in Woodhaven), and the reception was held at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706182712/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynnavyyard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a>&apos;s Building 121, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706182712/http://brooklynnavyyard.org/leasing/available-spaces/building-121/suite-101/">which still stands today</a>.</p>
