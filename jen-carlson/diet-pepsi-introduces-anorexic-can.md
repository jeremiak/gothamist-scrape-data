<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="fatskinnypepsi0211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132501im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/fatskinnypepsi0211.jpg" width="200" height="154" class="image-left"> </span>Do you like Diet Pepsi but sometimes think, &quot;this can is just so fat and unattractive!&quot; Well, Pepsi is unveiling their &quot;taller, sassier new Skinny Can&quot; which they say is a &quot;celebration of beautiful, confident women.&quot; Consider it a PILF. Or don&apos;t, because that might get you injured. </p>

<p>Marketing officer Jill Beraud adds that the new can is &quot;slim and attractive,&quot; but if that isn&apos;t your thing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132501/http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/08/news/companies/pepsi_skinny_can/index.htm">CNN</a> reports that &quot;for consumers who prefer their soda cans to be the traditional short and fat product&#x2014;no need to worry. A Pepsi spokeswoman confirmed the old model will remain on shelves.&quot;</p>

<p>The new can will be unveiled this Friday during Fashion Week, as part of Simon Doonan&apos;s public art installation at Diet Pepsi Style Studio in SoHo. You could stand to lose a few pounds before introducing yourself.</p>
