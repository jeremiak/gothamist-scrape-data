<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622052041/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/06/21/friday_night_video.php">A couple of years ago</a> Phish played one of their last shows, at Coney Island&apos;s Keyspan Park. Regretably we missed the shows. Thanks to YouTube we can now see a pretty good video of the band perform with Jay-Z. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622052041/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/track_reviews/29759/Cyann_and_Ben_Circle">Pitchfork</a> only gave the performance 1.5 stars, we still think it&apos;s pretty amazing.
