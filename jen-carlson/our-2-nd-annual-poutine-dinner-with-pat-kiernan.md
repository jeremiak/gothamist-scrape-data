</div></div>					<p>Last night a troupe of brave contest winners made their way to Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314040006/http://www.mileendbrooklyn.com/">Mile End</a> to indulge the decedent Canadian dish of poutine, with everyone&apos;s favorite newsman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314040006/http://www.patspapers.com/">Pat Kiernan</a>. Earlier this month, around Canada Day, we held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314040006/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/01/contest_alert_poutine_with_pat_kier.php">a contest</a> for our 2nd Annual Poutine with Pat dinner (the 1st was at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314040006/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/20/ny1s_pat_kiernan_takes_gothamist_re.php">Pommes Frites</a>)&#x2014;and last night we all congregated around massive amounts of smoked meat, gravy, cheese curd and fries. </p>

<p>And when <em>that</em> was finished, the good people at Mile End brought even more food over&#x2014;this time in the form of pickles and hot dogs. What better way to top all that off than with beers at the nearby Rock Shop? (Fun fact: people can recognize Pat by only hearing his voice.) While we research gym memberships, check out some photos documenting our night of overindulgence.</p>
