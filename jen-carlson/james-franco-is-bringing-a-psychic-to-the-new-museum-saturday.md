<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> We just received word that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312135124/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> has put his art hat back on and will holding court at the New Museum this coming Saturday, along with Laurel Nakadate (whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312135124/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/arts/design/23nakadate.html?pagewanted=all">provocative photography</a> projects we truly love). The event is the launch of James Franco&apos;s limited edition switchblade, which was made in homage to his late friend and fellow actor Brad Renfro, who died in 2008 from a heroin overdose.</p>

<p>THE THING Quarterly is hosting this switchblade shindig at the New Museum, where you&apos;ll get to witness a performance, a discussion with Franco and Nakadate, and a screening of Franco&apos;s short film <em>Brad Renfro Forever</em> (which recently played at Franco&apos;s show Rebel at MoCA in Los Angeles).</p>

<p>The event, which will take place from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., will also include a special guest: psychic Gemma Deller, who you may want to contact ahead of time to find out if you&apos;ll get in. We&apos;re told the event is &quot;Open to the public,&quot; but &quot;there&apos;s going to be a line up for it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&apos;re being told that the event is now RSVP only, and we&apos;ll be getting that RSVP info for you shortly and posting it here.</p>
