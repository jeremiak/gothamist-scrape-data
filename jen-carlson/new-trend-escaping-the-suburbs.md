It seems suburban developments nationwide are seeing the same problems the city streets are: druggies, homeless, grafitti, gang activity, broken windows, stray bullets, and even in Pleasantville <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417052519/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/21/copper.php">copper wire</a> is a commodity. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417052519/http://www.charlotte.com/local/story/401705.html">Suburban decay</a> is on the rise, making them a far cry from what they were presented as at the New York World&#x2019;s Fair of 1939 and &#x2019;40. The Highways and Horizons (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417052519/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74cO9X4NMb4">Futurama</a>) exhibit was the fair&apos;s most popular, and for the past 60 years Americans have fled the city for the McMansions in the &apos;burbs. But times they are a changin&apos;, now The Atlantic reports &quot;the pendulum is swinging back toward urban living, and there are many reasons to believe this swing will continue. As it does, many low-density suburbs and McMansion subdivisions, including some that are lovely and affluent today, may become what inner cities became in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s&#x2014;slums characterized by poverty, crime, and decay.&quot;</p>

<p>The presentation of suburbia at the Worlds Fair was followed by GIs returning home and families decamping to the city outskirts. By 1981 the trend hit the big screen in <em>Escape From New York</em>, showing the world an abandoned Manhattan (which became a maximum security prison). But soon after, the shift began to reverse, and with shows like <em>Seinfeld</em>, <em>Friends</em> and even <em>Sex and the City</em> portraying a <em>new</em> New York, urban allure was back. Today television and movies use the suburbs to portray soullessness and moral disrepair.</p>

<p>If the shift that&apos;s taking place continues, &quot;the world of tomorrow&quot; falling apart could actually be a good thing. With Main Street, USA morphing into a walkable urban area -- the population  and environment will benefit. The Atlantic states that &quot;if New York City were its own state, it would be the most energy-efficient state in the union; most Manhattanites not only walk or take public transit to get around, they unintentionally share heat with their upstairs neighbors.&quot;</p>
