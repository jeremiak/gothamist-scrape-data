title: Another Rustic Rooftop Paradise Has Been Found On The Upper East Side
---

	
										<p>How many rooftop residences are secretly hiding out above the streets of NYC? Recently we have seen several rooftop properties that we would have preferred having no knowledge of, ever: we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228230944/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/16/rooftop_cottage_envy.php">a rooftop cottage paradise in the East Village</a>, a rustic cabin on a rooftop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228230944/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/17/nyc_roof_cabin_with_yard.php">in the West Village</a>, and then there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228230944/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/18/the_swimmer.php">all those pools</a>. AND NOW? A more attainable rooftop homestead, perhaps: The Upper East Side rooftop shanty. </p>

<p>Behold:</p>

<p>This photo comes from tipster Alexandra, who tells us, &quot;We were on the rooftop today when we noticed this interesting structure on the building to the north of us (located at 92nd / Lex).&quot; (According to information found online, this building may or may not have &quot;a known leaking roof problem.&quot;) But does someone live there? It certainly looks like it&#x2014;with its sunbrella-striped awning, a sliding door, plenty of windows, and planters creating a homey landscape. </p>
