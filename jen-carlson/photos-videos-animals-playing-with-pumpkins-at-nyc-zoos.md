<p>In August <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155430/http://gothamist.com/tags/bronxzoo">the Bronx Zoo</a> welcomed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155430/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/22/photos_video_white_rhinos_debut_at.php">two white rhinoceros brothers</a>. The three-and-a-half-year-olds weigh in at about 4,000 lbs, but somehow didn&apos;t seem to use any of that weight to crush the pumpkin they were given as an early Halloween treat (meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155430/http://chicagoist.com/2012/10/25/brookfield_zoo_animals_enjoy_tasty.php#photo-1">this rhino in Chicago</a> gave its pumpkin the horn!).</p>

<p>Every year the Wildlife Conservation Society sends over photos of zoo animals gleefully playing with pumpkins&#x2014;last year it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155430/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/22/video_bronx_zoo_bears_get_into_the.php">bears</a>&#x2014;but this year it seems the budget only allowed for one, as this was the only photo we were sent. So let&apos;s take a look back at some video from previous years, when the zoos and aquarium were swimming in pumpkins...</p>
