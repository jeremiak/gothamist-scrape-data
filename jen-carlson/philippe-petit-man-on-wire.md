Once there, he walked across a cable strung between the Twin Towers, a historic feat that&apos;s vividly depicted in a new documentary, Man On Wire (which will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213340/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/17/man_on_wire.php">screening tonight</a>). The famous walk turned a void 1/4 mile above the streets into a stage, and made Petit into an instant &quot;folk hero.&quot; He now lives upstate in Woodstock, and yesterday we talked with him about those 45 minutes between the towers, that first daring step onto the wire, and the ones that followed.</em> </p>

<p><strong>When did the idea for the walk between the Twin Towers come to you?</strong> In 1968 I was 18 years old and I saw an article about those towers. There was a photo of a model, and the article said that they would be built one day, and they would be the finest in the world. And here I was, a completely new self-taught wire walker, and I thought, &quot;What a fabulous thing to transform the top of those towers to a theater for one morning.&quot; And that&apos;s how the idea came. </p>

<p><strong>Do you remember one particular moment from that 45 minutes more prominently than any other?</strong> Well, yes and no. Of course the very first step, as you can imagine, was a giant first step. But a few moments during those crossings I remember perfectly. But that first step was a giant moment for me: I was finally stepping in to my dream. So I remember that vividly. And at some point I stopped on the wire and I sat down, and I looked down all the way - a 1/4 mile to the empty plaza below - and I stopped and saw the crowd gathering around that plaza. Yes, I remember very well many, many moments in those 45 minutes. </p>

<p><strong>Can you describe at all what you were feeling when you took that first step?</strong> Yeah, I was extremely happy after all those years of dreaming and months of working on it, that now the dream was reality. And I was very concentrated and focused, in an open way, listening to everything, so that if there was a threat of some kind I would feel it. It was very delicate, because I had not seen the anchor point on the other side. Usually when I walk on a wire I inspect the anchor point on both sides before crossing. So here, my friend did it on the other side with my instructions, but I had not seen it. So it was very difficult. But after just a few steps - as I could see later from pictures taken by my friend on the north tower -  I had an immense smile on my face. So obviously it was only a few steps that were fragile and delicate. </p>
