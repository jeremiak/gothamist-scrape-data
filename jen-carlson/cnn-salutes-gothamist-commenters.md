CNN tracked down Meth to discuss his efforts (which have also received applause!), and puts a spotlight on our very own Gothamist commenters mid-way through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012175528/http://www.cnn.com/video/standard.html#/video/us/2011/09/01/pkg.moos.twin.towers.cnn?hpt=hp_bn1">Jeanne Moos&apos;s report</a>. Moos says, &quot;film buffs can&apos;t resist telling Dan Meth the clips he missed in his montage.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s looking at you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012175528/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/31/video_a_look_back_at_the_twin_tower.php#comment-299759043">Todd Holmes</a>, for your <em>Simpsons</em> call-out, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012175528/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/31/video_a_look_back_at_the_twin_tower.php#comment-299769114">Lawhawk</a> (referred to as &quot;someone&quot; in the report), for noticing the absence of <em>Godspell</em>. </p>
