<p>Recently a few people were absolutely <em>shocked</em> when they spotted what appeared to be a UFO hovering over Brooklyn. But why? Alien colonization is just a mere 11 days away, so of course we should expect to see UFOs at this point. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153855/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/04/x-files.php">That <em>X-Files</em> episode</a> aired ten years ago, and we&apos;ve been duly warned on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153855/http://www.alienshift.com/id1.html">credible websites</a> since then. And yet these poor deluded civilians seem completely caught off guard by the sighting, which occurred on December 3rd over the intersection of Vanderbilt and Dean in Prospect Heights.</p>

Each of the three finally stopped at the same point in the sky, hovered, and then disappeared. They made no noise, however, several people in the street did notice and stopped to watch.&quot; In the below video you can see the three glowing, slow moving orbs (ignore the fast moving object at the beginning of the recording, which is just a glare from the streetlight.</p>
