title: Video: Subway Performer Sings Adele's "Someone Like You"... Nails It
---

	
										<p>One of this season&apos;s greatest Saturday Night Live sketches was when they paid notice Adele&apos;s &quot;Someone Like You,&quot; and its ability to make everyone cry (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021936/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJuSCPxTUvo">video</a>). So naturally, when this subway performer at 86th Street beautifully belted out the tune, it got a lot of attention. He even tells the crowd afterwards: &quot;I tell you, if you ever see someone do that song and they don&apos;t drop a tear, don&apos;t give &apos;em shit, don&apos;t give &apos;em nothin&apos;, because that song is nothin&apos; but love.&quot; Watch below, and make sure you&apos;ve got a Kleenex handy.</p>
