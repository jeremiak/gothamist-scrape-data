<p>The first bowling alley to open in Brooklyn in (we can&apos;t even believe this) nearly 50 years is about to open up! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312102916/http://www.thegutterbrooklyn.com/">The Gutter</a> is new...but the feeling old. Brought to you by two of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312102916/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/08/paul_kermizian.php">the same people</a> who brought you Barcade, expect a similar vibe. There&apos;s a Schlitz globe spinning over the shoe counter, vintage bowling items adorning the bar, old lamps throughout, and even some TVs with rabbit ear antennas. </p>

<p>You won&apos;t find flashy flatscreens displaying your scores and advertisements hanging above the lanes. The scoring machines are straight out of the past, and the only advertisements are on the pin clearing machine. Those ads are likely for establishments in a town far far away, however -- as the equipment was all purchased from an old bowling alley in the midwest. </p>

<p>Some more fine details: the bar overlooks the lanes, there are no league nights, the bathrooms are unisex, and the bar is stocked with good beer (you can get pitchers too) and spirits. Located at 200 North 14th Street just west of Berry in Greenpoint, it&apos;s near Automotive High School -- but you can rest assured this is a 21+ establishment. </p>

<p>Regular Hours: Monday-Thursday 4pm to 4am; Friday-Sunday 12 noon to 4am.<br>
How much money you&apos;ll need: $4 shoes, $7/person/game, $6 during happy hour (M-F before 8pm)<br>
For groups of 4 or more:  $42/hour and $36/hour during happy hour.<br>
Cash only for bowling, but credit cards accepted at the bar for alcohol</p>

<p>The Gutter opens THIS WEEKEND with limited hours: Saturday 8pm-4am and Sunday 5pm-4am. Better stretch that bowling arm! </p>
