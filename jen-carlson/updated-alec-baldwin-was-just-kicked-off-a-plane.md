It seems that actor, and future mayor of New York, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> has been booted from his flight out of LAX. So far the only confirmations are from fellow passengers&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/https://twitter.com/#!/grantcardone/status/144162682227011584">Grant Cardone</a> Tweeted around 4:15 p.m.: &quot;Alec Baldwin is getting kicked off of AA flight as I tweet this!&quot; Which was followed by a Tweet from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/https://twitter.com/#!/mjw/status/144163608903958528">Michael J. Wolf</a>, saying, &quot;On an AA flight at LAX. Alec Baldwin removed from the plane We had to go back to the gate. Terrible that everyone had to wait.&quot; <em>Don&apos;t these people have camera phones?</em> We&apos;ll update when we have more details. </p>

<p>Elsewhere on Twitter, people are helping to fuel the as-of-now <em>rumor</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/https://twitter.com/#!/anildash/status/144168140669071360">Anil Dash</a> says, &quot;Have to imagine Tina Fey has a Google Alert for &apos;Alec Baldwin OR Tracy Morgan AND removed&apos; and every time the mail comes in, she just cries.&quot;</p>

<p>Baldwin is likely flying back to New York following an appearance on Conan last night, where he declared he&apos;s locked in the cab driver vote for his run for mayor of New York:</p>

He added that he also &quot;didn&apos;t have his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rVE7haSLmE">Capitol One card</a>.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/https://twitter.com/#!/AlecBaldwin/status/144174648920260608">Baldwin claims</a>, &quot;Flight attendant on American reamed me out 4 playing WORDS W FRIENDS while we sat at the gate, not moving. #nowonderamericaairisbankrupt&quot;</p>

<p>Around 5:30 p.m., after Baldwin has spent 20 minutes hyping up United <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/https://twitter.com/#!/AlecBaldwin/status/144179182375665665">on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/https://twitter.com/#!/AmericanAir/status/144182826114363393">American Airlines Tweeted</a>: &quot;@AlecBaldwin Mr. Baldwin, we are looking into this. Please DM us contact information.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve just about made it through this, guys! It&apos;s 5:40 p.m., and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531190307/https://twitter.com/#!/AlecBaldwin/status/144183978021224448">Baldwin just Tweeted</a>: &quot;Now on the 3 o&apos;clock American flight. The flight attendants already look... smarter.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, who has video of the incident that got him kicked off in the first place?</p>
