<p>Elvis Presley recorded a short song called &quot;Violet&quot; in October of 1968. While the production took place in Hollywood, the song was set all the way across the country <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104309/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/3kxk7x/once_upon_a_time_elvis_presley_sang_a_short_song/">at New York University</a>. The songs lyrics are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Underneath the foliage, in its bower set
Loveliest of the flowers of spring
Blooms the violet

<p>Violet, violet, flower of NYU</p>

<p>We will ever sing thy praise<br>
To thee we&apos;ll ere be true<br>
(We&apos;ll be true)</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The song was on the film&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104309/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Girls_(film)#Soundtrack">soundtrack</a>, though the film is set in small town America. Elvis did, however, spend time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104309/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/on_the_35th_anniversary_of_his_deat.php">in New York City</a>, so perhaps he was drawing on some personal experience for these lyrics...</p>
