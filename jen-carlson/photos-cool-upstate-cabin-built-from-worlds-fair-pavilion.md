                            <p>Years ago there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915093526/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/22/queens_candela_structures.php">an effort</a> to repair the two underappreciated fiberglass formations that stand on the Flushing Bay Promenade in Queens. The structures were pavilions from the 1964 World&apos;s Fair (the marina, to be exact), and like many things from the Fair, were left to deteriorate. But all this time there has been a mysterious missing third pavilion.</p>

<p>This weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915093526/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/nyregion/how-a-worlds-fair-pavilion-became-a-familys-cabin.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">the NY Times</a> delivered us a hefty dose of real estate envy with their article about a family who built a cabin in the Adirondacks out of the third pavilion. Carlos Stafford purchased the shell at a surplus auction in 1966 for just a few thousand dollars, and took the auction flier&apos;s suggestion of using it to build a summer cottage. The pavilion was taken apart (see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915093526/http://www.flickr.com/photos/65516705@N00/sets/72157633615102537/">disassembly process here</a>), a home was built in a remote area (a road needed to be built to access it), and &quot;The Glass Camp,&quot; as they called it, was ready to be occupied three years later. The 1,1000-square-foot space fit a kitchen, bathroom, dining area, living room, fireplace and four bedrooms.</p>

<p>Today, though Carlos died in 2004, the same family continues to use the cottage. And as for the two identical ones still in Queens, the Parks Department will conduct a study later this year to find out how much it would cost to restore them. You can see more photos of the two remaining structures as they stand today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915093526/http://www.flickr.com/photos/catasterist/sets/72157607913987802/with/3380480791/">here</a>, and keep updated on their fate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915093526/http://candelastructures.org/updates.html/">right here</a>.</p>
