<p>The Algonquin Hotel, most recently known for its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231082202/http://gothamist.com/tags/catfashionshow">Cat Fashion Shows</a>, is more <em>famously</em> known for its round table. And with Halloween creeping up, psychic medium A.J. Barrera stopped by the historic spot to see if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231082202/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table#Membership">Dorothy Parker &amp; Co.</a> are haunting the place. In the below video, he confirms that there are spirits roaming the halls, noting, &quot;just walking in here the energy was just very intense, my heart was going a mile a minute.&quot; He also says he felt the &quot;cold spot,&quot; which usually means there&apos;s something there, but only &quot;a full lockdown investigation&quot; would be able to show who exactly is haunting the hotel.</p>
