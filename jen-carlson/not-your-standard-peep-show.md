Heavens to Murgatroyd! Who will save the children? Not hotel management. </p>

<p>The paper points out that they actually encourage this behavior online; their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194954/http://www.facebook.com/posted.php?id=98007263384&amp;share_id=244112040640#/TheStandardNY?v=wall&amp;viewas=739845114">Facebook page</a> says, &quot;We encourage you to exercise your inner exhibitionist,&quot; and their website asks, &quot;Whatever you do, just make sure the shots are HOT and that you get them to us in whichever way you can. It&apos;s all about sex all the time, and you&apos;re our star.&quot; This disappeared after the Post contacted the hotel for comment, however.</p>

<p>City Council Speaker Christine Quinn says she plans to check up on the hotel&apos;s &quot;unacceptable&quot; actions. In the meantime, we await all of these professional High Line porns that have allegedly been filmed there. Porn with a view!</p>
