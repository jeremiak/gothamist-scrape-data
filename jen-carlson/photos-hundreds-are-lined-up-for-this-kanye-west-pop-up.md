<p>First a Duane Reade, then a Chase Bank, that frozen yogurt place, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072137/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/17/kanye_west_pablo_pop-up_shop_will_b.php">a Kanye West Pop-Up Shop</a> has moved into the neighborhood? What&apos;s next, a Sweetgreen? SoHo is over. </p>

<p>It hasn&apos;t been specifically stated what&apos;s inside of this pop-up, but we&apos;re guessing there may be some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072137/http://cheezburger.com/7670556160">$120 white T-shirts</a>, some Yeezys (those are sneakers), a Kardashian or two? Kanye himself? No one knows. But this pop-up is intended to draw more attention to his album, <em>The Life Of Pablo</em> (work in progress), and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072137/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/kanye_yay.php">clothing line</a>. Regarding his presence, Kanye just tweeted a photo he may or may not have taken from the scene at 83 Wooster Street.</p>

<p>Others have been Tweetgramsnapping from there, too. The line appears to be made up of hundreds of people who have nothing better to do than wait on line to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072137/http://sfist.com/2016/02/15/kanye_west_says_hes_53_million_in_d.php">donate to this struggling artist&apos;s fund</a>.</p>
