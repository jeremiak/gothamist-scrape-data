According to a copy of a lawsuit obtained by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120533/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/glowing_water_poison_pool_suit_zHVutYGEXayhBy7rkjOyjK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">the NY Post</a>, what could <em>and did</em> go wrong was that the pool at the Sunset Park party (hosted by Unicorn Meat NYC) was filled with glow-in-the-dark &quot;water&quot; which left two party attendees with &quot;permanent&quot; vision impairment.<p></p>

<p>The event&#x2014;called Return to the Bubble Kingdom&#x2014;took place on August 4th, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120533/https://www.facebook.com/events/491002804247355/">the Facebook page</a>, was scheduled to run from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. VIP tickets cost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120533/http://fla.vor.us/1129495-Return-to-the-Bubble-Kingdom-tickets/Return-to-the-Bubble-Kingdom-Brooklyn-The-Bubble-Factory-August-04-2012.html">around $90</a>.</p>

<p>The two 19-year-old women, Rocio Marie Cabrera and Sarah Deodath of the Bronx, have now filed a lawsuit against the promoters as well as warehouse owner Atlantic Properties. It states that the organizers &quot;dumped toxic chemicals into the large pool to alter &apos;the color and/or reflective properties&apos; of the water,&apos;&quot; which led to the women ingesting and absorbing the &quot;dangerous, hazardous and/or toxic chemicals.&quot; Their lawyer, Keith Sullivan, called the pool a &quot;chemical soup.&quot; The suit states the women have been left with a &quot;permanent reduction of visibility in both eyes.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Another attendee at the party tells us that the pool was &quot;the size of a typical backyard above-ground circular pool,&quot; and that &quot;no matter how screwed up you were, it was easy to see you shouldn&apos;t go in that pool&#x2014;it was filthy, the water was green, and it was leaking into the basement.&quot; She added that the pool access was only for those with the $90 VIP tickets, &quot;but I didn&apos;t see any signs or security keeping regular ticket holders out.&quot;</p>
