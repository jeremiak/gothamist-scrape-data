<p>Yesterday the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041411/http://gothamist.com/tags/yeahyeahyeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> debut album, <em>Fever To Tell</em>, turned ten years old. That actually feels about right! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041411/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/28/pearl_jam.php">For once</a>. In celebration that we&apos;re all aging so nicely (you guys look great, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041411/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/21/gothamist_celebrated_our_10th_anniv.php#photo-1">we look great</a>, &quot;Maps&quot; looks great), let&apos;s revisit the band in that year, and the years leading up to their debut album (which was nominated for a Best Alternative Music Album Grammy in 2004).</p>
