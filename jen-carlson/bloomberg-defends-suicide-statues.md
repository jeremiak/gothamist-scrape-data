The outdoor installation features cast iron statues of human figures, bolted to the ledges of buildings&#x2014;like the Empire State Building, where just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121743/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/31/esb_jumper.php">last month</a> a man jumped to his death.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121743/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/leaping_to_defense_grG6ZDI0m78TxBRZJJ0GZK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, when asked if they should be taken down, Bloomberg declared, &quot;No. It&apos;s a great exhibition. It&apos;s one of those things that gets publicity around the world, brings tourists to New York.&quot;</p>

<p>All in all there are 30 of Antony Gormley&apos;s statues placed on roofs and ledges in midtown, and one NYPD source says they get at least one call a day about them. Though Bloomberg said, &quot;My understanding is that there&apos;s no record of most of the calls. There were a handful. But if you give enough press, if your arts section really writes the story of this... then people will know it&apos;s great art, including our Police Department.&quot; Is he suggesting the NYPD not respond to calls where the statues are in place?</p>

<p>In response, one officer asked: <strong>&quot;Why not put statues on the corners holding guns at night? That would be fun artwork, wouldn&apos;t it?&quot;</strong> And as for those tourist bucks being brought in, one teacher from New Jersey says when she took her 6th graders on a field trip, they &quot;were frightened. They all screamed. They thought it was somebody who was going to commit suicide.&quot;</p>
