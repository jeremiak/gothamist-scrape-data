</div></div>					<p>Two weeks ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140305/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/show_us_your_apartment.php">we asked to see your apartments</a>. New Yorkers, including us, are voyeuristic creatures (admit it), and who doesn&apos;t love to see how their neighbors are living... even if it can lead to pangs of jealousy. So here is our first installment, which comes with a pretty amazing story from Lisa R., dating back to 1980. </p>

<blockquote>In 1980 I moved into an abandoned East Village tenement [at 11th Street and Avenue A] that lacked electricity, running water, windows, heat, toilets, sinks, stoves, refrigerators and plumbing, which had been torn out of the walls by junkies looking for scrap to sell, leaving giant holes in the walls and ceilings&#x2014;the wind used to whistle through in the winter. <strong>We used to take showers in the fire hydrant across the street, and at night when we came in we&apos;d have to crab-walk sideways up the stairs with a pipe or bat because we had no idea who might be waiting to mug us in the unlit hallways.</strong> I spent 6 months living by candlelight and using large cans as a toilet, two years without heat or running water in my space.</blockquote>  

<p>Lisa tells us the building had been abandoned for a decade when she moved in, &quot;it was on the city&apos;s rent rolls because the landlord had walked away from it and not paid taxes for two years.&quot; So she ended up purchasing <em>two</em> of the apartments (directly from the city, under the Tenant&apos;s Interim Lease program) in the building for just $500 total. At this time, &quot;<strong>landlords were either burning down or abandoning their buildings in certain neighborhoods as fast as they could, so the city wound up with thousands of unwanted buildings on their rent rolls</strong> that they had no idea what to do with.&quot; While 500 bucks for two apartments in the East Village may seem like a steal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140305/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php#photo-1">this was the 1980s</a> East Village, <em>and</em> a lot of money had to go into fixing up the two apartments, which eventually became one.</p>

<blockquote>Mine is a double apartment; I connected to the one across the hall because no one else wanted it, and I knew it was my only shot at getting a decent-sized and affordable living space in Manhattan. In the course of turning it from a wrecked shell filled with dozens of quart-size soda bottles of old urine (there when I moved in, not mine!), old mattresses, and all the junk and detritus an abandoned building collects, I tore down walls and ceilings, built new ones, sanded floors, learned to do plumbing and some electric, put in windows and did all the other little things to turn it into a home.</blockquote> 

<p>The apartment has a garden view, a bedroom, a library, a bathroom, a walk-in closet, a kitchen, and a large living room (in the photos, this is the space with yellow walls). Lisa tells us, &quot;I closed off the library window when the drug dealers in the next building used to watch to see when my lights were out and then come over the roof, down the fire escape and try to rip me off, so it&apos;s a fairly dark room. Hence the need to have windows in my bedroom and bathroom walls so the sun can come through and light it. The dealers are long gone so I could re-open the embrasure, but then I&apos;d lose that shelving. Plus I like the sort of hermetic air it gives the room&#x2014;makes it cozy, especially in winter.&quot;</p>
