</div></div>					<p>In the mid-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214317/http://gothamist.com/tags/1970s">1970s</a>, things were considerably rougher in the Big Apple&#x2014;so much rougher that the Council for Public Safety (police, firefighters and other unions) had plenty of material to publish a scaremongering pamphlet called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214317/http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/fear_city/">Welcome to Fear City: A Survival Guide for Visitors to the City of New York</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>If you had plans to visit NYC, you would probably swiftly abandon them after seeing this thing, which<em> featured a skull on the cover</em>. Just like the skull under your pretty face that would surely be slashed should you dare walk the streets after 6 p.m., or leave Midtown, or take the subway ever. The tips inside included:</p>

<ul><li>Stay off the streets after 6 p.m.
</li><li>Do not walk &#x2014; &quot;If you must leave your hotel... summon a taxi by telephone.&quot;
</li><li>Avoid public transportation &#x2014; &quot;You should never ride the subway for any reason whatsoever.&quot;
</li><li>Remain in Manhattan &#x2014;&#xA0;&quot;If you remain in midtown areas and restrict your travel to daylight hours, emergency service personnel are best able to provide protection.&quot; 
</li><li>Protect your property
</li><li>Safeguard your handbag
</li><li>Conceal property in automobiles
</li><li>Do not leave valuables in your hotel room, and do not depotist them in hotel vault
</li><li>Be aware of fire hazards</li></ul>

<p>But few even saw it, as it received such negative publicity that it never even got distributed. In 1975, the NY Times wrote, &quot;For the second time in as many days, unions representing policemen, firemen and other public-safety officers won affirmation in court yesterday of their constitutional right to pass out &apos;Fear City&apos; leaflets at transportation terminals, hotels an shopping districts. The unions, however, faced with mounting criticism of their tactics in attempting to pressure the Beame administration to rescind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214317/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/05/nyregion/recalling-new-york-at-the-brink-of-bankruptcy.html">planned layoffs</a> of 10,962 uniformed officers, continued to hold in abeyance distribution of the black-bordered, skull-emblazoned pamphlets warning tourists to stay out of New York because of rampant crime and inadequate fire protection.&quot;</p>

<p>The paper reported the following month that they &quot;resumed distributing leaflets that the city is unsafe because of the dismissal of 3,000 police officers,&quot; but the new ones were titled, &quot;If You Haven&apos;t Been Mugged Yet...&quot; Here&apos;s a look back at that old footage showing just what the city&apos;s public transportation system&#x2014;a hotspot for crime&#x2014;was like back then:</p>
