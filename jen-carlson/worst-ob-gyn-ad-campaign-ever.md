Dr. Leon Nitkin has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501063433/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=7251">posted ads</a> for his OB/GYN practice on some &quot;of the newly-renovated buildings on the south side of Greenpoint Ave b/t Manhattan and Franklin.  Everything about it says &apos;please don&#x2019;t let this man touch your privates, even in a medical context.&apos;&quot; Well, not everyone can be as web-savvy as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501063433/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/01/jay_parkinson_m.php">Dr. Parkinson</a> or his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501063433/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/14/hello_health.php">Hello Health</a> franchise. Anyway, the doc <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501063433/http://www.ucomparehealthcare.com/drs/new_york/obstetrics_and_gynecology/Nitkin_Leon.html">appears to be legit</a>, maybe he just needs to ditch the over-eager smile and bowtie. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501063433/http://pistolsandpopcorn.com/2008/08/24/and-then-sometimes-words-fail.aspx">Pistols and Popcorn</a> saw the ads on Jay Street.</p>
