The festival will take place in neighborhoods underneath <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154204/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/04/10/high_line_const.php">the High Line</a>, the public park which will be transformed from the abandoned elevated railway line on the west side of Manhattan. Who is curating such an event? David Bowie. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154204/http://billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002464920">Billboard</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Bowie will play a large outdoor concert, his first show in New York since 2003. He will also select musicians and artists to appear throughout the festival. &quot;I&apos;ve been particularly excited about seeking out emerging artists and giving them a place in a festival that will also feature some very well-known names,&quot; Bowie says.</blockquote>

<p>Note: David Bowie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154204/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/06/21/movable_hype_30_recap.php">came to our Movable Hype show last year</a>, seeking out Clap Your Hand Say Yeah. What else is he listening to? He tells New York Magazine, &quot;&apos;I&#x2019;ve been listening to Arcade Fire and Secret Machines and this great opera from the eighties called Nixon in China.&apos;&quot; So there are some obvious contenders for headliners for the festival, but we&apos;re excited to see who else Bowie embraces in the music scene in the next year. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522154204/http://www.nymag.com/news/intelligencer/16865/index.html">the same article</a> he also says he&apos;ll be taking a year off from touring and recording, it looks like he found a project to work on when he&apos;s not sneaking in to movies at the Angelika - of which he said, &quot;&apos;I like going out to the Angelika: If the first one&#x2019;s only okay, I&#x2019;ll sneak into one after the other. It&#x2019;s so easy.&apos;&quot;</p>
