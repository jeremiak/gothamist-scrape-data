Sometimes we even learn new things, like how Mike Birbiglia is totally cool with eating food in an airplane bathroom. <em>You never know what will happen</em>, but everyone has got a story and there&apos;s nothing like alcohol and celebratory surroundings to bring them out. This year, the event will move from Capitale to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095518/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Theatre">the Hudson Theatre</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095518/http://themoth.org/posts/the-joint-is-jumpin-the-moth-ball-2013-is-here">for a &quot;Joint Is Jumpin&apos;&quot; themed gala</a>. They note:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;In 1929, the Hudson Theatre was host to the famous musical revue <em>Hot Chocolate</em> by Fats Waller. At the intermission of the show, Louis Armstrong made his Broadway debut playing a trumpet solo from Ain&apos;t Misbehavin&apos; which was to hit the pop charts that year. The Moth Ball 2013 is set against the back-drop of that history and the lyric from Honeysuckle Rose, one of Fats&apos; best known songs &apos;So Sweet When You Stir It Up&apos; inspired the theme of the evening&apos;s Moth&apos;s stories: Stirring It Up.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The May 14th event will be hosted by the garrulous Garrison Keillor, and feature new stories from Adam Gopnik, Richard Price and Satori Shakoor; and our popular national GrandSLAM winners. Albert Maysles will be on hand receiving the Moth Award, and they promise &quot;plentiful cocktails and hors d&apos;oeuvres and fun post-story dancing on the Hudson Theatre&apos;s famous proscenium stage.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095518/http://themoth.org/posts/the-joint-is-jumpin-the-moth-ball-2013-is-here">Tickets are</a> $195 (balcony seats) to $350 (table seats), but it really is worth the price (seriously we only say this about the Moth Ball and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095518/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/22/momas_garden_party_will_honor_mayor.php">MoMA Garden Party</a>&#x2014;every other day of the year we prefer to drink our wine in solitude and sweatpants).</p>
