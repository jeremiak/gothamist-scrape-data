<p>Tomorrow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/dont-trust-the-b-in-apt-23"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/james_van_der_beek_plays_james_van.php"><em>Don&apos;t Trust The B&#x2014; In Apartment 23</em></a> will premiere on ABC, but you can already watch the first two episodes on Hulu, which we have&#x2014;we&apos;ve got that soft spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/lena_dunham_interview_1.php">for Dawson Leery</a> after all, and Krysten Ritter most recently won us over with her role as Jane on <em>Breaking Bad</em>. In <em>Apartment 23</em>, the two play best friends, with James Van Der Beek playing a more Hollywood playboy version of himself. </p>

<p>One of the reasons we&apos;re so excited for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">upcoming HBO series <em>Girls</em></a> is that it&apos;s realistic in its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">portrayal of both NYC</a> and, well, girls. <em>Apartment 23</em> is like the opposite of that (and sure, not all television needs to be realistic, we get it, escapism!). With <em>Apartment 23</em> you get another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/video_two_broke_girls.php"><em>2 Broke Girls</em> storyline</a>, with a naive blonde (Dreama Walker) and a sassy brunette navigating their way through this <em>cuh-razy</em> town one deception and mistake at a time. The show is hinged upon absolutely unrealistic characters and scenarios, which <em>can</em> work (see: <em>It&apos;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>), but so far isn&apos;t really doing it for us in this case. Did we mention their neighbor who masturbates while talking to the girls through their kitchen window and taking sips out of his volunteer FDNY coffee mug? ONLY IN NEW YORK, amirite?</p>

<p>While the show hasn&apos;t won us over yet, many others seem to like it, or believe it shows promise&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/witchy_way_out_S4NEqOwnBKT7METHhjcM9M#ixzz1reOMheM7">The NY Post</a> notes that &quot;The series starts out badly (idiotic masturbation jokes), [and] builds quickly. And the co-stars are flat out terrific together.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406101956/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947356">Variety</a> insinuates it hits its stride in the third episode. And James Van Der Beek&apos;s character <em>is</em> great, and will likely keep viewers (and us) coming back at for at least a few return visits. </p>
