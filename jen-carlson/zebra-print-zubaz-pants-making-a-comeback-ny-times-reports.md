The article is part trend piece, and part fashion scaremongering, as there&apos;s probably <em>really</em> only a 45% chance* of a Zubaz comeback.<p></p>

<p>At the center of the story we have Dan Stock, creator of the pants, who recently noticed that the new basketball shorts that Adidas was unveiling for the N.C.A.A. tournament had a decidedly Zubaz look to them and may be sparking a rebirth of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110611/https://www.google.com/search?q=zubaz&amp;aq=f&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=u6c3Ue2XOOXn0wGE9IHQAg&amp;biw=1693&amp;bih=881&amp;sei=xKc3UcupF-jB0gGg0IH4Ag">the zebra-print pant</a>. Stock told the paper, &#x201C;I took one look and was like: &#x2018;Oh, boy. Here we go again.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>To answer Robbins&apos;s aforementioned question, Zubaz are basically a sweatpants-chef pants-Hammer pants hybrid, featuring an elastic waist and an oversized leg that gradually tapers as it nears the ankle. They were very popular amongst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110611/http://club937.com/ians-photo-of-the-night/">the Joey Buttafuoco set</a> in the early 1990s&#x2014;and we assume the Dude preferred them for their relaxed fit and freedom of movement. </p>

<p>But this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110611/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/it_happened_to_me_i_wore_meggings_a.php#photo-1">the Age of the Megging</a>&#x2014;does such a loose pant really stand a chance amongst such a form-fitting generation? The Gray Lady says yes, warning: &quot;Zubaz are enjoying something of a rebirth. Zubaz refuse to die.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="photo_caption">*This percentage is based on a total guess, figuring in the the chance of an ironic comeback amongst a certain set in Brooklyn.</span></p>
