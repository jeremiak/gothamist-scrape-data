<p>Daniel Radcliffe is letting it all out there today, guys. First up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201607/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/daniel_radcliffe_miffed_that_harry_siMNWOiKdOnZ9MvJyfDqEP">the NY Post</a> quotes the actor as saying, &quot;I don&apos;t think the Oscars like commercial films, or kids&apos; films, unless they&apos;re directed by Martin Scorsese. I was watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201607/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179/"><em>Hugo</em></a> the other day and going, &apos;Why is this nominated and we&apos;re not?&apos; I was slightly miffed.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201607/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/daniel-radcliffe-admits-sex-groupies-article-1.1018825#ixzz1lns84CLK">the Daily News</a>, the actor talks about sex with his fans. Which, fine, but Harry Potter groupies? It just seems like that might get weird. Or <em>young</em>. But mostly weird. Radcliffe says, &#x201C;I was always very nervous about the groupie thing. I like to like somebody before I sleep with them. You know, you&#x2019;re going to have to talk to them afterwards, even if it is a one-night stand. Generally speaking I&#x2019;ve known the person. Apart from a few times when I was drinking.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And if groupie sex&#x2014;which we&apos;re assuming involves owls and wands and stuff?&#x2014;doesn&apos;t act as a warm, albeit temporary, refuge from the Academy diss, then Radcliffe&apos;s always got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201607/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/02/07/nick-jonas-daniel-radcliffe-broadway/">these kind words from a Jonas brother</a>.</p>
