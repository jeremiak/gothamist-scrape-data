										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bobst112009.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150519030132im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bobst112009.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="image-left"> </span>Early this morning we received an email from an NYU student who was studying at Bobst Library. He told us that around 4:30 a.m. he heard a &quot;huge boom&quot; that ended up being a successful suicide attempt. He told us the &quot;kid must have jumped from high judging from where he landed in the lobby. Couldn&apos;t tell his condition from what I saw. I was told by a cop on the scene that he didn&apos;t look good.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD confirmed that a male did jump, and is now deceased, and we are waiting for NYU spokesman John Beckman&apos;s statement about the incident. After 9 a.m., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150519030132/http://nyunews.com/news/2009/nov/03/death/">Washington Square News</a> reported that Bobst had reopened, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150519030132/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2009/11/03/nyu-tours-at-bobst-despite-student-death-this-morning/">tours are still being conducted</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 2003 and 2004 there were multiple suicides in the library, which led to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150519030132/http://gothamist.com/2003/10/14/suicides_lead_to_librarys_barriers.php">installation of panels</a> on the inner balconies to prevent further attempts.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> NYU President Sexton has sent out an email to students that you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150519030132/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2009/11/03/death-in-bobst/#more-18004">read here</a>. And NYU Spokesman John Beckman has sent us the following statement (which is continued after the jump).</p><blockquote>&#x201C;The death of a College of Arts and Science junior early this morning in Bobst Library is a matter of great sorrow for the NYU community.  In a close-knit community of young people such as ours, the death of a fellow student is always keenly felt. While the cause of this death is still being determined, indications are that he took his own life.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>
