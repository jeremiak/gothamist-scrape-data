<p>In May of this year we made a promise, after seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152144/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/dels.php">what we believed to be a mirage</a> or manifestation of our nostalgia problem: &quot;If Del&apos;s NYC turns out to be a real thing, we will update you. Every day. Forever.&quot; The truck turned out to be the real deal, and was soon on the road <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152144/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/20/the_nyc_dels_truck_is_on_the_road.php">slinging frozen lemonade</a>. And now there&apos;s an update: Cam Crockford, the Hero who brought the Rhode Island treat to the Big Apple, is looking to add a second Del&apos;s truck (or... 1950 Chevy Stepvan) for next summer. In order to do that, he&apos;s raising funds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152144/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/820180783/dels-nyc">through Kickstarter</a>&#x2014;below, learn a little bit about the history of Del&apos;s in his pitch:</p>

<p>Now where can we toss our money to get a liquor license for these trucks so they can spike our frozen drinks?</p>
