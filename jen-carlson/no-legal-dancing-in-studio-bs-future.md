At the core of the club&apos;s problem are the neighbors, who are now getting as loud as Studio B&apos;s late night parties, while running wild with <em>Footloose</em> laws clenched in their fists. Amongst their complaints are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140905/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/studio_b_1.php">the new roof deck</a>, the trash, the noise and of course the dancing &#x2013; the horrible, illicit, sinful dancing. <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140905/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/31/31_31_bm_studiob.html">This one time</a> one of them saw a girl flash her breasts inside of the club on the dancefloor!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140905/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/31/31_31_bm_studiob.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that only about three people spoke in favor of Studio B, insisting that it&apos;s not that noisy and, furthermore, the club &#x201C;put Greenpoint on the map.&quot; In an attempt to mollify the neighbors, Studio B&apos;s lawyer, Ken Fisher, came armed with a list of compromises, including:</p><ul><li>Better soundproof on the deck<br>
</li><li>Permanent signage urging club-goers to keep quiet when outside<br>
</li><li>A second set of double doors at its entrance to muffle noise<br>
</li><li>A roped-off smoking pen on the sidewalk in front of the club <br>
</li><li>Better trash cleanup and a security patrol</li></ul>In the end, the neighbors were not won over, and the panel voted against the club. Fisher claimed a lot of the finger-pointing was inaccurate (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140905/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/29/studio_b_2.php">blame the patrons</a>!), and that he &quot;was shocked that people in the neighborhood would complain about someone lifting their shirt up.&quot; Ultimately CB1&apos;s executive committee will meet again and the DCA will cast the final judgment, which could put a cabaret license in the hands of the owners, or not. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140905/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=6421">Miss Heather</a>, a local who has voiced her distaste for Studio B in the past, has a play-by-play of the meeting from last night. She notes that on July 23th the club &quot;ceased using the rooftop garden because the Mayor&#x2019;s Office for Special Enforcement closed it down.&quot; Rumor has it that some of the upcoming shows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140905/http://blog.deleteyourself.com/post/44372440/studio-b-is-shut-down">have been canceled</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140905/http://www.clubstudiob.com/calendar.html">moved to Southpaw</a>, which could mean the entire club is now shut down; we contacted the management but have yet to hear back.</p>
