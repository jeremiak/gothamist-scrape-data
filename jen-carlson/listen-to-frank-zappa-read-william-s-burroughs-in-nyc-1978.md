	<p>In 1978, Frank Zappa was in New York City for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330002208/http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/The_Nova_Convention.html">the Nova Convention</a>, a three day event that featured readings, performances, panel discussions, and film &quot;that sought to grapple with some of the implications of the writing of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330002208/http://gothamist.com/tags/WilliamsBurroughs">William S.

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330002208/http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/13/specials/burroughs-convention.html">The NY Times</a> reported after the event that &quot;the convention drew an interesting cross-section of people, and one suspected that only Mr. Burroughs could have brought them together. There were more or less conventional poets, novelists, performing artists, composers as diverse as John Cage and Philip Glass, rock musicians, serious students of American literature, street types and others.&quot; There was also a midnight concert featuring Robert Fripp, Blondie, and others.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s more audio from the event&#x2014;a conversation with Timothy Leary, Les Levine, Robert Anton Wilson and Brion Gysin:</p>
