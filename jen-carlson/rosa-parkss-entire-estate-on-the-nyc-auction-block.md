</div></div>					<p>There are some interesting, and very private, items on the auction block at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227222715/http://www.guernseys.com/Guernseys%20New/rosaparks.html">Guernsey&apos;s</a>, belonging to the mother of the Civil Rights movement, Rosa Parks.</p>

<p>Parks died in 2005, and over the past six years there has been plenty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227222715/http://www.freep.com/article/20110721/NEWS06/107210550/Lawyer-Rosa-Parks-estate-drained?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE">debate over her estate</a>. Steven Cohen, who represents the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, is fighting to get the memorabilia back, and says &quot;the court system of her adopted city has embarked on a course to destroy her legacy, bankrupt her institute, shred her estate plan and steal her very name.&quot; The courts selected Guernsey&apos;s Auctioneers to find an institution to buy and preserve the complete archive.</p>

<p>So now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227222715/http://www.guernseys.com/Guernseys%20New/rosaparks.html">Guernsey&apos;s Auctioneers</a>, located here in New York, is offering up the memorabilia&#x2014;which includes everything from a postcard from Martin Luther King, Jr. to a pancake recipe to a handwritten, detailed account of Parks&apos;s neighbor attempting to rape her in 1931. (It&apos;s unclear if the account is from a journal, or if Parks meant for it to be read by the public.) </p>

<p>The auction house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227222715/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5huVnzYkWmQKxQZLa4KSbJUVXyQuQ?docId=17065ea3f7474e2d8f9b6c0a5334f66a">noted</a> that the the only thing missing from their lot is the bus itself. The entire lot is being sold as a single collection (likely around the $10 million mark), which has taken The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a research library of the New York Public Library, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227222715/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/07/29/rosa-parks-essay-reveals-131-rape-attempt/">out of the running</a> since they can only afford a few items.</p>
