The space is separated into three apartments, but the reclusive Clark was the only inhabitant of all three... unless you count her dolls. That&apos;s right, there was a creepy doll collection, which the cleaning staff (the only people allowed inside the hospitalized heiress&apos;s digs) attended to. Appraiser and real estate broker Barbara Fox declared, &quot;There were dolls everywhere&quot;&#x2014;she is one of the only realtors allowed inside of the space, which the site offers a little history on:</p>

<blockquote>When 907 Fifth Avenue went co-op in the 1950s, Huguette Clark and her mother, Anna La Chapelle Clark, purchased the three spaces they were renting: Both of the apartments that comprise the eighth floor&#x2014;giving them an eye-popping total of 10,000 square feet on that level&#x2014;plus a half-floor unit on the 12th floor, the building&#x2019;s top story. At some point, they added more bedrooms to their 12th-floor space, bringing it to roughly 7,000 square feet, said Key Ventures&#x2019; Larry Kaiser, who said he&#x2019;s sold some 14 apartments in the building over the years. Anna died in the 1960s, and Clark&#x2014;Anna&#x2019;s only surviving child&#x2014;inherited all three apartments.</blockquote>

<p>The three apartments will be put on the market separately, and are each expected to go for &quot;tens of millions of dollars.&quot; Dolls not included.</p>
