<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602070750/http://gothamist.com/tags/poolparties">Pool Parties</a> are just about a week away, and the lineup has <em>finally</em> been announced... maybe. Here&apos;s what the schedule allegedly looks like; it was posted yesterday but the organizers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602070750/http://jellynyc.com/blog/?p=457">at Jelly</a> then wrote something about &quot;the person posing as one of us, the elusive non-existent &apos;hacker&apos; and the fake line up.&quot; What? Anyway, we happened to see a confirmed lineup earlier this week that looked very similar to this, so there&apos;s a pretty good shot it&apos;s what you&apos;ll be hearing at the Williamsburg waterfront this summer:</p>

<ul><li><strong>July 11</strong>
Xiu Xiu and Deerhoof play Joy Division&apos;s Unknown Pleasures, Why?, Fang Island, Pictureplane
</li><li><strong>July 18</strong>
Murder City Devils, Obits, Jeff the Brotherhood, Silverghost
</li><li><strong>July 25</strong>
Cap&apos;n Jazz, Lightning Bolt, No Age, The Death Set
</li><li><strong>August 1</strong>
Block Party @ Brooklyn Bowl (TBA)
</li><li><strong>August 8</strong>
Cut Copy, Memory Tapes, Glasser, Restless People
</li><li><strong>August 15</strong>

</li><li><strong>August 22</strong>
Chromeo, TBA, The Suzan, Telephoned
</li><li><strong>August 29</strong>

<p>And if you see Chuck out there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602070750/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/schumer_saved_the_pool_parties.php">show him some love</a> (if he&apos;s not too busy hobnobbing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602070750/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/31/the_grizz.php">with Jay-Z</a>).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Jelly folk have confirmed and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602070750/http://www.thepoolparties.com/">officially announced</a> the above lineup. Bonus: this video...</p>
