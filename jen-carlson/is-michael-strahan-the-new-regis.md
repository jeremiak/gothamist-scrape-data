<p>Earlier today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145959/http://www.showbiz411.com/2012/08/20/seth-meyers-still-in-lead-to-co-host-with-kelly-ripa-pat-kiernan-secondhe">there were reports</a> that Seth Meyers and Pat Kiernan were at the top of the list to co-host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145959/http://gothamist.com/tags/livewithkelly">Live! With Kelly</a>... but now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145959/http://www.tmz.com/2012/08/21/abc-staffers-michael-strahan-kelly-ripa-co-host-live-abc/">TMZ is reporting</a> that the new Regis will be former New York Giants player Michael Strahan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145959/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/488733-Exclusive_Michael_Strahan_to_Be_Named_Cohost_of_Live_Alongside_Kelly_Ripa.php">B&amp;C;</a> backs up this report with their own &quot;exclusive,&quot; adding that Strahan will &quot;remain in his role with Fox NFL Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p>As for TMZ&apos;s sources, they claim that Strahan has come out on top, and that his &quot;rep was seen outside the building on 67th and Columbus a short time ago grinning from ear to ear.&quot; This dance probably didn&apos;t hurt: </p>

<p>All year potential <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145959/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/seth_meyers_josh_groban_amongst_top.php">co-hosts have been tried out</a>, and the big announcement was supposed to come on September 4th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145959/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/pat_kiernans_dreams_come_true_on_li.php#photo-1">We&apos;re still rooting for Pat</a>, of course.</p>
