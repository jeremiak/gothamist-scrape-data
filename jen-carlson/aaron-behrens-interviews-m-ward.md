										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpO6Z9AMPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213217im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpO6Z9AMPM.jpg" width="350" height="225" class="image-left"> </span><em>After hearing about how much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213217/http://www.myspace.com/ghostlandobservatory">Ghostland Observatory</a>&apos;s Aaron Behrens admired the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213217/http://www.myspace.com/mward">M. Ward</a> (pictured), we decided to ask him to interview the musician for us. Ward recently released his sixth solo effort, Hold Time, and will be delivering tunes in his soothingly achy voice to those in attendance at his Central Park Summerstage show this Saturday. As for Behrens, his band will be playing this Sunday at the All Points West Festival. Catch them both! But first listen in as the two talk shop...</em></p>

<p><strong>I read that for Conor Oberst&apos;s last album he flew in a special 16 track machine that you use for your recordings. What&apos;s so special about this piece of gear? Did you use this piece of gear on your new record <em>Hold Time</em>?</strong> We used it a little bit&#x2014;the new record we recorded on 24 track 2&quot;, 16 track 1&quot; and 4-track 1/8&quot;&#x2014;Conor recorded the first MVB record on the 16 track 1&quot;&#x2014;which is special because it keeps you from adding too much stuff and helps your guitars sound more like Guided By Voices instead of digital recording which makes most guitars sound like Jan Hammer.</p>

<p><strong>Being a Texas boy my self i thought the cover of Buddy Holly&apos;s &quot;Rave On&quot; was a nice touch. What made you choose that song? Its strange, your album came out around the anniversary of his death. Did you mean for that to happen?</strong> I chose that song because its been rattling around in my head for half my life and i tried stripping the melody down to a solo guitar instrumental - and i liked where it was going. its a good simple melody and buddy holly wrote a ton of those. Releasing the song at the anniversary of his death was a coincidence.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of cover songs. I love your cover of David Bowie&apos;s &quot;Let&apos;s Dance&quot; off your <em>Transfiguration of Vincent</em> album. Have you ever had any response from Mr. Bowie about that song?</strong> My European label at the time said there was a positive one when it was first released but I really don&apos;t remember if it was fact or rumor.</p>
