<p>In 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317185926/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/lawrence_wright_interview.php">Lawrence Wright</a> published what would become his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317185926/https://www.amazon.com/Looming-Tower-Al-Qaeda-Road-11/dp/1400030846"><em>The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11</em></a>, a historical examination of the beginnings of Al-Qaeda, and a &quot;controversial look at how the rivalry between the CIA and FBI may have inadvertently set the stage for the tragedy of 9/11 and the war in Iraq.&quot; His expos&#xE9; will now be adapted for the small screen, in an original Hulu series called <em>The Looming Tower</em>, and Jeff Daniels has just been announced to star as John O&apos;Neill.</p>

<p>O&apos;Neill is &quot;the determined, at times bull-headed chief of the New York FBI&#x2019;s Counter-Terrorism unit... [who is] rightly convinced that the U.S. has been targeted for attack by Al Qaeda, and faces deliberately insufficient cooperation from other organs of the Federal government, particularly from his counterpart at the frequently antagonistic CIA.&quot; He is described as &quot;a man of appetites, a lover of expensive food and drink,&quot; and a womanizer with multiple girlfriends, a wife, and kids. </p>

<p>While the 9/11 attacks have gotten a Hollywood treatment before, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317185926/http://screenrant.com/looming-tower-jeff-daniels-hulu-911/">Screenrant</a> points out, most shows, documentaries and feature films have &quot;focused either on the attacks themselves, or the effect they had on American society afterward,&quot; while this one focuses on what preceded that day, including the aforementioned infighting between the CIA and FBI.</p>

<p>The series will be delivered in 10 hour-long episodes written by Dan Futterman (<em>Capote</em>) and directed by Alex Gibney (<em>Going Clear</em>). There is no premiere date set, but the limited series will hit Hulu this year.</p>
