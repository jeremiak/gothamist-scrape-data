<p>Yesterday there was a bit of a panic when the Occupy Wall Street library was taken by the Department of Sanitation. Many believed the entire contents of the tent went in to the trash, but then Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s office Tweeted a photo of boxed up books, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151058/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/occupy_wall_street_library.php">saying they were safe and sound</a>. Some questions remain, however. Did the DSNY dig back into the trash after the media took aim, only salvaging some of the contents of the library? How many items are missing? And where is the structure that Patti Smith funded to house the library? </p>

<p>Today, the OWS Library blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151058/http://peopleslibrary.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/update-state-of-seized-library-items/">has updated</a> the situation, saying they are still missing thousands upon thousands of items (their list is below, and is a work in progress). We called the DSNY this morning to ask about the missing and destroyed items, but we were told it would take some time to get some answers&#x2014;we&apos;ll update when we hear back.</p>

<p>As of now, the protesters say they only received 25 boxes of books, and many of the books are destroyed, along with the reclaimed laptops. The tent and shelves all seem to be MIA, and the belief is that the DoS may be digging back into &quot;their giant trashpile at [the] back of [their] building&quot; to come up with more of the library&apos;s destroyed contents. In the meantime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151058/https://twitter.com/#!/OWSLibrary/status/136837595459100672">the librarians</a> are calling upon Mayor Bloomberg for answers, saying &quot;he lied.&quot;</p>
