</div></div>					<p>This morning, as members of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014062940/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/russian_court_finds_pussy_riot_guil.php">Pussy Riot were dealt a guilty sentence in Russia</a>, supporters of the three women were out in force all over the world. In New York City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014062940/https://www.facebook.com/events/262241200554708/">a march</a> began at 9 a.m. at the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church, followed by the Russian Consulate on East 91st Street. The NYPD were warning the group that they were &quot;obstructing a public sidewalk,&quot; and just around 10 a.m. photographer Jessica Lehrmen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014062940/https://twitter.com/Jessierocks/status/236467618356277248">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Shits about to go down.&quot; There have been multiple arrests since then, with protesters refusing to remove their masks as they&apos;re led into police cruisers. </p>
