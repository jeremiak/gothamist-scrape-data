According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080151/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/04/naw-on-shepard-faireys-mural">Animal</a>, around 2 a.m. &quot;graffiti writer NAW decided to contribute to the mural, but was abruptly thwarted by a security guard hired to babysit the wall. The vandal managed to escape by wiggling out of his shirt as the retired cop says he dialed 911 with one hand and tried to subdue him with the other.&quot; Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080151/http://twitter.com/SLUTLUST/status/12632116729">according to Twitter</a>, &quot;Some kid just tried to do a throw up on the Shep piece on Houston &amp; Bowery. Got yoked up by a dude in a truck.&quot; Are the same cops that spent years <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718080151/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/21/interview_shepa.php">trying to capture Fairey</a> now protecting his art? It would seem so.</p>
