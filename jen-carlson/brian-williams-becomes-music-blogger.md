Let&apos;s just say the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234230/http://britunes.blogspot.com/2009/05/oh-hell-to-no.html">original BriTunes</a> is less than thrilled about this, however Mr. Williams says, &quot;I didn&apos;t name this thing, but I did come up with the idea.&quot; The idea of music blogging? So ahead of his time. He continues, saying, &quot;<strong>I have always loved identifying good music and good groups&#x2014;discovering them early (bar bands are best) and following them through their journey. </strong>While we&apos;ll interview some established musicians, mostly I&apos;d like this to be a place where people can sample some of the great music being created every day.&quot; He starts with the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234230/http://www.myspace.com/deertick">Deer Tick</a>, who have been around since 2004 and are currently on a major national tour, which included plenty of dates with Jenny Lewis earlier this year. </p>
