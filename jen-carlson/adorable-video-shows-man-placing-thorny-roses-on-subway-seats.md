<p>Someone (Hallmark channel? Oprah? Monsanto? The Koch Brothers?) has placed roses on the seats inside some subway cars, allegedly because it&apos;s a nice thing to do around Valentine&apos;s Day. But there&apos;s also the chance that this person/corporation is just trying to impale straphangers with thorns. Or worse: promote something. Or even worse: go viral. As Ween once said, and Phish once repeated, &quot;Don&apos;t believe the professionally shot video when it tells you that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061244/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-18cAiRCur0">the roses are free</a>.&quot;</p>
