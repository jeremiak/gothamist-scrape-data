<p>If nothing else, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317182333/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/subway_11.php">The Youth of America</a> really knows how to drop truth bombs, especially about the things that matter. A few days ago one 12-year-old wrote an essay (presumably for school) about that sneaky plain doughnut, the one that&apos;s always trying to fit in with all the other much more interesting doughnuts. The passionate young pastry lover penned this following takedown of the fauxnut:</p>

<blockquote>You know what I think is weird? Fake doughnuts, aka plain ones. I mean, you just stroll into a Dunkin&apos; Donuts and you see all the different flavors and types, like Glazed, Strawberry, Boston Kreme, and Chocolate Frosted. And there, just sitting there among all the wonderful flavors, acting like it belongs there, is Plain. Right there... just like all the regular ones. But it&apos;s not! It&apos;s not one of them! It has no frosting, no sprinkles, no glaze, no cream, no fillings or toppings at all! <strong>It shouldn&apos;t even be called a doughnut! Or a pastry of any kind! It&apos;s just a BAGEL! A BAGEL!</strong></blockquote>

<p>Anonymous tween, we would like to subscribe to your newsletter. And (s)he didn&apos;t even get into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120317182333/http://www.dunkindonuts.com/content/dunkindonuts/en/menu/nutrition/nutrition_catalog.html?nutrition_catalog_hidden=0&amp;nutrition_catalog_needType=Food&amp;nutrition_catalog_selPage=1&amp;nutrition_catalog_perPage=100">nutritional information</a>. Did you know that a boring plain doughnut packs 320 calories and 22 grams of fat. That is more fat that <em>a decedent ECLAIR</em>!</p>
