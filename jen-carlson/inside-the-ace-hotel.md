</div></div>					<p>Look out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104136/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/13/the_standard.php">Standard</a>, the Ace Hotel is here! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104136/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/26/the_ace_hotel_a.php">Last summer</a> renderings of the establishment&apos;s interior began to circulate, as well as some more details about what the chain would bring to New York (they currently have outposts in Seattle, Portland and Palm Springs). Today we stopped by for a sneak peek inside the still unfinished hotel, located at 29th and Broadway. The room we saw had all the fun details the Ace is known for, and rumor has it that long ago the longest ever boxing match happened in the basement of the building, which is why the hotel made the bath robes look like boxing robes!</p>

<p>Though you won&apos;t be able to rest your head there until the end of March, they&apos;re taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104136/http://www.acehotel.com/newyork">reservations</a> now with opening rates at a low $99. There&apos;s even something for locals: the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104136/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/4/32_4_bm_stumptown_short.html">caffeine craze</a>,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104136/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/what_you_need_to_know_about_stumpto.php">Stumptown Coffee</a>, will be housed in the lobby.</p>
