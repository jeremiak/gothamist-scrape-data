Owner Tom Birchard told SE that they were &quot;slammed all weekend&quot; with folks allegedly wanting to recreate the scene where Michael Cera and Kat Dennings enjoy some pierogies at the 24-hour eatery (the address is even given in the dialogue). No word on if Arlene&apos;s Grocery also saw an influx of customers, but our very own Billy Parker was at Veselka on Saturday at 10 p.m. and says it was &quot;definitely not&quot; crowded, nor was the clientele younger than usual. In fact, he says, &quot;two middle aged-men were sitting alone on either side of me. It reminded me that romance is usually best left to the movies.&quot;</p>
