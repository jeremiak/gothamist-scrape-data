</div></div><p>The big blue whale that &quot;lives&quot; in the American Museum of Natural History&apos;s Milstein Hall of Ocean Life was given a wipe down today. The annual cleaning took place just after noon today, but the whale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201092049/http://twitter.com/#!/nathistorywhale">hasn&apos;t Tweeted since</a>... the earthquake! It&apos;s understandable, she&apos;s old&#x2014;the whale was installed in 1969, when technology wasn&apos;t so advanced.</p>

<p>We&apos;re told that long-handled brushes and vacuums were used to wipe away the dust and dirt from the iconic 21,000 pound exhibit. That probably took a few times longer than it takes to give your NYC apartment a cleaning.</p>
