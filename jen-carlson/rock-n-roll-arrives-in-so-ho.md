<p>This week the 76 Mercer Street location officially opened to the tune of $9 million. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210410/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/29556/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-annex-opens-in-new-york/">ArtInfo</a> reports that the &quot;25,000-square-foot basement space, focuses on New York rock culture, with a special gallery devoted to local musicians and temporary exhibitions that change biannually. The first show, &apos;Revolution Rock,&apos; is devoted to The Clash&quot; (<em>from London</em>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210410/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/arts/music/21rock.html">The NY Times</a> reports back that &quot;the wooden phone box from CBGB, plastered with decades-old stickers&quot; and &quot;graffitied wall sections from that landmark club, along with two of its loudspeakers and a metal frame for the CBGB &amp; OMFUG awning&quot; are also making a new home at the Annex.</p>

<p>The full shebang will cost you $26, with a full tour running about 90 minutes. Joel Peresman, president of the Hall of Fame Foundation, says &quot;in New York you have to prove yourself, whether you&apos;re a sports team or a museum. We have an important story to tell. And you have to have something interesting and compelling; otherwise, New Yorkers are going to blow it off.&quot;</p>
