They posted photos of the dog, postmortem, and say the NY ASPCA refuses to get involved, claiming it&apos;s a civil matter and they don&apos;t handle airport deaths. The dog was found dead, allegedly having froze to death, after the plane landed at JFK airport. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406155318/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/29/one_puppy_survives_frozen_flight.php">Last month</a> another puppy froze to death on a flight bound for the same airport. There <em>are</em> temperature restrictions &quot;to ensure animals are not exposed to extreme heat or cold in the animal holding areas, terminal facilities, when moving the animals between terminal and aircraft or on an aircraft&quot;&#x2014;so why does this keep happening? We&apos;ve contacted the APSCA as well as Delta for comment, and will update when we hear back.</p>
