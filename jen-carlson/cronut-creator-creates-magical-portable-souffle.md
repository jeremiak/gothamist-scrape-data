<p>Dominique Ansel, the man who created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908042114/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronuts">the Cronut</a>, has unveiled his new item: The Magical Souffl&#xE9;. The creation is basically a portable souffl&#xE9; that you rip apart with your hands before delicately shoving it into your mouth. 2 out of 2 Jens at Gothamist thought it was &quot;decadent and delicious&quot;&#x2014;while it won&apos;t debut until this coming Saturday, the Chef was kind enough to let us try it out this afternoon. </p>

<p>Ansel is mum on his secret process, saying he uses chocolate, sugar, and egg whites, but &quot;the techniques are where the magic comes in.&quot; There&apos;s &quot;no molecular gastronomy. There&#x2019;s no spherification or adding strange hydrocolloids. I believe in using the same classic ingredients, but combining and cooking it in different ways.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The outcome is a triple-textured edible cube, made up of a crispy toasted orange blossom brioche shell, fluffy chocolate souffl&#xE9;&#x2014;complete with gooey molten center&#x2014;and a hint of Grand Marnier. He notes that the flavors, orange and chocolate, &quot;capture Fall for me.&#x201D; </p>

<p>As with many of the bakery&apos;s items, this one comes with instructions on how to best enjoy:</p>

<p>1. Eat immediately while warm.<br>
2. Do not refrigerate as that causes the brioche to turn stale from the humidity.<br>
3. Do not reheat as the souffl&#xE9; is cooked perfectly to feature a moist and slightly <br>
molten center.<br>
4. Bite directly into or cut delicately with a serrated knife as the souffl&#xE9; is very tender.</p>

<p>We hear a few lucky people in the Cronut line tomorrow will get one of these (and maybe even a free Cronut) from Ansel himself, who tries to surprise his sleepy Cronut fans from time to time.</p>

<p>Stay tuned tomorrow for even MORE from our visit to Dominique Ansel&apos;s bakery, where you&apos;ll get some much better pastry porn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908042114/http://instagram.com/p/d48RTErEAA/">from photographer Sam Horine</a>. Following that, we&apos;ll try to have a new post for you every week until the end of time.</p>
