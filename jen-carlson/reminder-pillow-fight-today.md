<p>Today marks the 5th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202914/http://gothamist.com/tags/pillowfight">Annual Pillow Fight</a>... and <em>why not</em> spend this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202914/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/02/sunny_and_warm_weekend_ahead.php">beautiful afternoon</a> pummeling strangers with your pillow? The organizers at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202914/http://newmindspace.com/">Newmindspace</a> say, &quot;Teddies fly and pillows soar as we gather for a massive urban pillow fight in Union Square. Swing and whack as you evade pillow-wielding assailants. Dress in pajamas and clean up your mess afterward.&quot; Also of note: don&apos;t ruin the fun by packing your pillow with anything hard, and try to swing lightly. In other words: play nice!</p>

<p>The group will meet at Union Square (East 14th Street and Broadway) at 3 p.m. If you spot the feathery fight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202914/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us your photos</a> (or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr)!</p>
