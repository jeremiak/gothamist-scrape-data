<p>Rapper T.I.&apos;s clothing line, AKOO, has put up a billboard in Newark that has locals fanning themselves and suffering spells! The advertisement shows a woman holding on to a man&apos;s unbuttoned jeans whilst his hand is placed lovingly against the back of her head. Those gutter-minded Jerseyites think these two had, or are just about to engage in, oral sex. Blush! The image hangs above a major intersection, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712165055/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7303111">Eyewitness News reports</a> that while &quot;people on the street said they never noticed the billboard before,&quot; they had plenty of opinions once it was pointed out.</p>

<p>A Rutgers marketing professor asks, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the message here? &#x2018;If I wear these clothes more women will want to have sex with me.&apos;&#x201D; (Sounds like AKOO may have a new customer!) Meanwhile, City Council President Mildred Crump told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712165055/http://blog.nj.com/njv_barry_carter/2010/02/sexually_suggestive_jeans_bill.html">NJ.com</a>: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so sick of people seeing Newark as a place where they can do whatever they want. They think they can put it in a black community and nobody is going to say or do anything.&#x201D; But these sexually suggestive billboards are everywhere (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712165055/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/is_the_calvin_klein_billboard_offen.php">underage orgy</a>, anyone?)&#x2014;in fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712165055/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/24/calvin_klein_billboard.php?gallery0Pic=3#gallery">this one that hung on Houston Street</a> may have even been worse.</p>

<p>Mayor Corey Booker addressed the billboard, saying, &quot;So often when I am out in the community I see kids wearing their pants too low... I will work with my city council to see if we can address it so we don&apos;t see these types of advertisements displayed in our city in the near future.&quot; Hey, maybe that girl is just trying to pull that guy&apos;s jeans up... maybe she&apos;s <em>part of the solution</em>.</p>
