Way to go, right? Except those seven schools are getting called out for containing the unhappiest students in the nation. (All the happy kids are allegedly at Brown University.)</p>

<p>In the city, those schools include The New School&apos;s Eugene Lang College (which apparently also has some of the worst food) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152122/http://gothamist.com/tags/bobstlibrary">New York University</a> (which has received low ratings for years regarding its financial aid and administrative services). Meanwhile, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152122/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ny_school_dispirit_rclNuL2fdjPiLz4kbe7gDK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, Columbia University ranked first in the &quot;Great College Town&quot; category, and the New School took home the blue ribbon for encouraging class discussions (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152122/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/17/cops_arrest_new_school_students_at.php">protesting</a>?). </p>

<p>Other schools in the five boroughs that can be found in the latest results include Brooklyn College and Queens College&#x2014;which were both near the top of the sober list!</p>
