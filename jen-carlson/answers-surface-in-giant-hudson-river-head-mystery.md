<p>In April, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727220135/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/25/giant_head_found_in_hudson_river.php">a giant head was discovered</a> floating in the Hudson River by members of the Marist College crew team, and while no one knew its origin, some tossed out theories. Could it have come all the way from Mardi Gras in New Orleans, or the Bardavon 1869 Opera House in Poughkeepsie? The mystery may have been solved...</p>

<p>Yesterday a tipster sent us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727220135/http://old.thedailystar.com/news/stories/2004/09/02/head.html">a 2004 article</a> featuring this creepy headline: &quot;The Head keeps watch from hill in Meredith.&quot; It told the story of a New Jersey couple, Louis and Kimberly Moses, who bought an 8-foot fiberglass sculpture from a junkyard and placed it on the hill of their new Meredith, NY property (which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727220135/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=meredith+ny&amp;ll=42.171546,-74.4104&amp;spn=5.666684,11.601563&amp;hnear=Meredith,+Delaware,+New+York&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=7">not exactly close</a> to the Hudson). &quot;The Head&quot; (as they call it) was originally crafted as a display piece for Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City.</p>

<p>Townsfolk were excited by The Head when it first arrived, and the town clerk had told the paper: &quot;When I heard about it, I drove over to see it. I think it&#x2019;s interesting, artsy and cool, and it&#x2019;s in a great place.&quot; The sculpture reportedly weighed 300 lbs, and when the head was found floating in the Hudson, it took 10 athletic young men to drag it out (granted, it was water logged).</p>

<p>So, people of Meredith, is The Head missing? We have contacted the Town Clerk&apos;s office there and will update if we hear back.</p>
