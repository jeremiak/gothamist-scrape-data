A Brooklyn grandmother rented a VHS copy of <em>Austin Powers</em> at the Borough Park library branch for her grandkids to watch, and someone had spliced it with &quot;long pornographic scenes&quot; during the credits, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205344/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07142009/news/regionalnews/brooklyn/xxx_tape_at_library_179164.htm">The Post</a> reports. Esther Klein put in a call to assemblyman Dov Hikind about the x-rated rental, and he&apos;s now demanding local libraries ban VHS. Here we were worried about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205344/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/10/are_your_children_safe_from_sand.php"><em>the sand</em></a> when the real danger to our children is the local library! Hikind declared, <strong>&quot;This is unbelievable. The bottom line is that the local library can be unsafe for young children. It&apos;s pretty sick stuff.&quot;</strong> He added that children can psychologically suffer <em>forever</em> from this type of exposure. But what about grandma renting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205344/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/parentalguide">PG-13</a> movie (for nudity and sex-related dialogue/humor) with a character named Alotta Fagina (pictured) in it for her 7-year-old grandkid? Maybe there should be some scaremongering about the real enemy: grandmas! Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Library is all, &quot;we have the problem under control and will remove the tape.&quot;</p>
