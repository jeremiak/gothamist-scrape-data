<p>The never-ending battle between Brooklyn and Manhattan continues, this time with a poster war. It all began when Brooklyn&apos;s Fourth Floor Print Shop called Manhattan U-G-L-Y, which was met with a response that only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519225517/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/brian_williams_humorously_skewers_t.php">Brian Williams</a> could love (knocking on the borough&apos;s fixation with everything artisinal). The response actually came from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519225517/http://www.jamescampbelltaylor.com/?page_id=2286">James Campbell Taylor</a>, who told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519225517/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2011/05/dear-brooklyn.html">Vanishing NY</a> he was compelled to fight back &quot;after growing tired of such tiresome jabs towards Manhattan. What began as a form of reverse snobbery is in many cases revealing itself as sheer ignorance. Whatever you say about this island&#x2014;and the well-documented changes it&apos;s going through&#x2014;it remains undeniably one of the most wondrous places in the Western World.&quot;</p>

<p>Staten Island, The Bronx, and Queens... we challenge you to get in on this battle, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519225517/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us</a> your posters! In the meantime...</p>
