<p>Upon first glance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140458/http://www.deadline.com/2012/10/paramount-punts-kevin-costners-draft-day-is-tom-cruises-our-name-is-adam-next/">this Deadline exclusive</a> may look like it&apos;s about Ivan Reitman and Kevin Costner&apos;s <em>Draft Day</em>, but really it&apos;s about how <em>Ghostbusters III</em> is happening, and soon. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve been hearing about the possibility of this movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140458/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters3">since 2008</a>, when it looked like it was going to get a bromance twist with rumors that Seth Rogan and Judd Apatow were attached. Since then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140458/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/dan_aykroyd_says_there_will_be_a_gh.php">Dan Aykroyd confirmed</a> the movie would happen; Bill Murray allegedly shredded the script <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140458/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/bill_murray_allegedly_shredded_the.php">and declared</a>: &quot;No one wants to pay money to see fat, old men chasing ghosts!&quot;... and finally, Aykroyd was said to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140458/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/dan_aykroyd_may_recast_bill_murray.php">re-casting</a> Murray&apos;s part.</p>

<p>The Deadline report states that &quot;Paramount chose not to make [<em>Draft Day</em>] in the small window that Reitman has before he is expected to finally get the long-gestating <em>Ghostbusters</em> reboot in front of the cameras next summer for Sony Pictures (sans Bill Murray).&quot; So the next question is, will it film in NYC (like at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823140458/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/30/tk_photos_from_behind_the_scenes_of.php#photo-4">some of the original did</a>)?</p>
