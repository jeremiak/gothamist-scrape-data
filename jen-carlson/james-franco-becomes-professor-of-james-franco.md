College of Hollywood is offering a class on Columbia University grad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212634/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212634/http://www.good.is/post/need-more-james-franco-in-your-life-there-s-a-college-class-on-him/">GOOD</a>, the actor/artist/everyman designed the college course himself (of course he did!), and here&apos;s the deal: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Master Class: Editing James Franco...with James Franco&quot; will be offered by Columbia College Hollywood. Only 12 of the best editing students at the private film school will be selected to participate. 

<p>Once they&apos;re in the class, students will be tasked with creating &quot;a 30 minute documentary film from videographic footage from Mr. Franco&#x2019;s own unorthodox career.&quot; Essentially, it&apos;ll be a film about James Franco made from behind the scenes footage of James Franco.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Always finding new ways to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212634/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/07/james_franco_is_a_real_jerk-off.php">stroke his own</a> ego! Professor Franco will be hands on, and checking in on his students via Skype and in person, so try not to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212634/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/27/james_franco_says_he_never_fell_asl.php">fall asleep</a>, grasshoppers.</p>
