title: Firefighter Arrested At Metallica Show
---

<p>Metallica just finished up a two night run at Madison Square Garden, and at least one fan is likely still reeling from Sunday night&apos;s show. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705061711/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bravest_busted_at_msg_concert_TCNY8loKqlf6fJVxEjBv5L">The NY Post</a> reports that 33-year-old New York firefighter, Gerard Weihe, got ejected from the show by security guards (for standing on chairs and &quot;making a racket&quot;). After being tossed, he came back for an encore and kicked in a plate-glass window! So hardcore... and so arrested.</p>
