<p>The photo was taken in 1896 by Irving Underhill, and is tagged: Hudson River, Lower Manhattan, and New York Harbor in the Museum of the City of New York&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311101350/http://collections.mcny.org/">archives</a>. Towards the left side you can see a spire, which could be Trinity Church&apos;s, but do you recognize any other buildings in this skyline of Manhattan?</p>
