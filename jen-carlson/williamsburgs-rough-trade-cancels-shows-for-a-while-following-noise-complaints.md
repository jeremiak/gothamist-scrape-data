<p>Yesterday Andrew Bird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085131/https://www.facebook.com/AndrewBirdMusic/posts/10152032115089699">announced</a> that his show at the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085131/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/record_store_opening_in_brooklyn.php">Rough Trade record store</a> in Williamsburg was cancelled &quot;due to a local noise ordinance.&quot; The store, which doubles as a venue booked by Bowery Presents, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085131/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/24/williamsburgs_rough_trade.php#photo-1">opened late last month</a> with a separate (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085131/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/24/williamsburgs_rough_trade.php#photo-6">but connected</a>) 250-capacity performance space. Since then they have hosted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085131/http://www.roughtrade.com/events/2013/11">several acts</a>, including Sky Ferreira and Television.</p>

<p>After less than two weeks of shows, the store announced that &#x201C;following consultation with local residents and local authorities, Rough Trade and the Bowery Presents have decided it would be best to put &#x2018;on hold&#x2019; all live performances at the Rough Trade NYC store, until further notice. This decision has been made to allow additional sound remediation work to be carried out, during which time scheduled RTNYC live events, where possible, will be transferred to the other local venues.&quot; They also announced the news on Twitter, following with a list of the cancelled shows, and shows moving to the nearby Music Hall of Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The space is still opened as a record store, but it&apos;s unclear when performances will be back on&#x2014;the statement we received from Rough Trade simply said shows were on hold &quot;for a while.&quot;</p>
