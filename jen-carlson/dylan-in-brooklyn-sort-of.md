Dylan wasn&apos;t there, but a look-a-like was on hand along with a ton of faux-hippies. The posting called for: </p><blockquote>- Men and women in their 20s-40s who are fans of Bob Dylan. Prefer people who embody the style of the 1960s, 70s or 80s (i.e. hippies, disco dancers, punks), but we are open to anyone who is a fan of Dylan and wants to be in his music video.<p></p>

<p>- Bob Dylan look-a-likes at any stage of his life between 5&#x2019;7&#x201D; &#x2013; 5&#x2019;9&#x201D; in height. If you feel like you have his look, style or would fit into these decades because of the clothes you have tucked away or a groovy car, we want to hear from you.</p></blockquote> Guess <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325181947/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/26/dylan_biopic.php">Cate Blanchett</a> wasn&apos;t available, but the Dylan doppelg&#xE4;nger pictured surely fooled some passerby into believing the folkie found the fountain of youth. <p></p>

<p>The Simple Mission stopped by to check out the scene and has more on what went down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325181947/http://simplemission.typepad.com/home/2007/08/simple-mission-.html">here</a>, along with plenty of pics. The video was for &quot;Most Likely You&apos;ll Go Your Way (And I&apos;ll Go Mine)&quot; which is getting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325181947/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/15787506/exclusive_qa_mark_ronson">remix treatment from Mark Ronson</a> - we hear Wyclef Jean stopped by for a cameo at the end.  </p>
