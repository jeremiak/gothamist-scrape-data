<p>The latest trend according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174412/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/did-you-need-us-to-tell-you-that-twilight-could-cause-seizures/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">the NY Times</a>? Having seizures at the new <em>Twilight</em> movie! Except, wait, that&apos;s not a trend, like vodka tampons and sexting are trends, that&apos;s just something that&apos;s happening to people. We repeat: having a seizure during <em>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn&#x2014;Part 1</em> will in no way heighten the experience for you. However it <em>is</em> happening to people&#x2014;specifically (spoiler alert?) at the end, when audience members suspend disbelief once again as Bella gives birth to a baby that she conceived with her vampire husband Edward.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174412/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/nov/25/twilight-breaking-dawn-causes-seizures">to reports</a>, during this scene, which features rapidly changing colors, a few viewers say they experienced epileptic seizures. The Guardian believes that the &quot;strobing red, white and black imagery may have triggered episodes of photosensitive epilepsy&quot; in these viewers (one male in Salt Lake City, another in California, <em>so far</em>). </p>

<p>Anyway, we made it through without having seizures, but perhaps that was because we were so distracted by how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174412/http://crushable.com/entertainment/kristen-stewart-pro-thinspo-breaking-dawn-513/">disturbingly thin</a> Kristen Stewart was in the movie&#x2014;though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174412/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/twilight-kristen-stewart-breaking-dawn-257717">she says</a> it was all done digitally.</p>
