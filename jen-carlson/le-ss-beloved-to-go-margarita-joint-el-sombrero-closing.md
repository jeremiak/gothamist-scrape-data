<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/el_sombrero_may_be_next_les_busines.php">disturbing news</a> that the Lower East Side&apos;s beloved El Sombrero&#x2014;aka The Hat, which has been there since 1984&#x2014;was in danger of closing. At the time, a waitress there explained, &quot;I think that&apos;s the sad fact, we don&apos;t fit in any more.&quot; And now they&apos;re preparing to say their final goodbyes. We&apos;re going to need a few <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://www.flickr.com/photos/joypopturbo/257839682/">to-go margaritas</a> to get through this.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2013/09/breaking-el-sombrero-closing-become-artichoke-pizza-outpost/?utm_campaign=boogie_twitter&amp;utm_source=boogie_twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Bowery Boogie</a> reported last night that Community Board 3 had 108 Stanton listed as an SLA applicant, and that the address would soon be home to an Artichoke Pizza. They spoke with someone at the restaurant who confirmed the sad news, but added the Artichoke deal wasn&apos;t finalized yet. They note, &quot;Apparently the owner has, in so many words, had enough and simply decided to cash out the business.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://gothamist.com/tags/riples">Lower East Side</a> has seen a lot of casualties this year, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/29/max_fish_will_pour_its_last_les_boo.php">Max Fish</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/27/lolita_bar_closing_next_week.php">Lolita</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/motor_city_bar_announced_june_closi.php">Motor City Bar</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/les_mainstay_pink_pony_closes_forev.php">Pink Pony</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202905/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/les_restaurant_alias_is_closing.php">Alias</a>.</p>
