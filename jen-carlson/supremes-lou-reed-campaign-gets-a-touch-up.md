<p>Recently the New York label <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131030025119/http://www.supremenewyork.com/">Supreme</a> posterbombed neighborhoods with their Spring/Summer 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131030025119/http://www.highsnobiety.com/news/2009/02/25/lou-reed-for-supreme/">campaign</a>. The posters are simple, featuring a photo of musician Lou Reed (shot by Terry Richardson) wearing a Supreme t-shirt (accessorized with aviator sunglasses and a smug expression). Street artist Faile has now altered the images, with a tiger face in place of Lou&apos;s, and the word &quot;Vanity&quot; in place of &quot;Supreme.&quot; Upgrade?</p>
