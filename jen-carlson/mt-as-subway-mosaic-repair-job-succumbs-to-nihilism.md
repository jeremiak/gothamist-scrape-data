title: MTA's Subway Mosaic Repair Job Succumbs To Nihilism

<p>After a Steinway Street subway station mosaic crumbled apart, the MTA recently dispatched workers to make the necessary repairs. But it appears that once the workers arrived at the job site, they suddenly realized the utter futility of an existence trapped in the inescapable maw of death, and revolted against the whole Sisyphean charade of neverending repair work. The blackness of the tiles represents the vastness of the dark, indifferent void. Either that, or these black tiles are covering up some naughty bits. </p>

<p>We reached out to the MTA to find out more about this piece of work, and will update if we hear back. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154924/http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2014/02/just-embarrassing.html">Queens Crap</a>]</p>
