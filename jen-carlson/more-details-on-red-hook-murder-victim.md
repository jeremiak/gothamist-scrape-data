Born in Jamaica, Tajeme Sylvester was raised in Brooklyn; a graduate of both Brooklyn Tech H.S. and Fordham University. He was crashing at the gallery while he worked on it, and the owner (who calls himself a &quot;space age herbalist&quot;) was out of town. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326004049/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/01/11/2011-01-11_young_man_killed_in_art_gallery_was_carpenter_renovating_the_place_but_his_death.html?r=news">the Daily News</a>, neighbors heard gunshots just before 6 p.m., and police found him with one shot to the head and one to the chest.<p></p>

<p>The victim&apos;s sister, Najla, says, &quot;I don&apos;t know what to make of it. I can&apos;t picture anybody wanting to murder my brother. This is the last thing I ever expected to hear. He&apos;s not that type. I&apos;ve never heard of him being into any stuff like this.&quot; She described him as upbeat and smart.</p>

<p>Investigators believe Sylvester knew his killer&#x2014;there was no sign of forced entry or struggle. An employee of nearby Woofs n&apos; Whiskers told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326004049/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/2/cg_gallerymurder_2011_1_14_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t seen any art there, but I have seen some kids hang out and smoke weed outside. It&#x2019;s always been pretty quiet.&#x201D; A quote that allegedly prompted the paper to dub the gallery as &quot;psychedelic&quot; in its headline.</p>
