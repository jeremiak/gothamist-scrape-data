<p>Last night the Grim Reaper returned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/new_banksy_is_at_elizabeth_and_hous.php#photo-1">the Houston and Elizabeth Street lot</a> and performed for the crowd from dusk until just after 11 p.m.. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> installation will return again tonight for one last time (it&apos;s unclear if it will close a little early again), and it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if spectators got a little something extra&#x2014;last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/photos_video_banksys_enchanting_mob.php">the Garden Truck</a> rolled up on the Reaper. For life and death are one!</p>

<p>The arrival of the truck last night came with the arrival of more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php">Banksy team members</a>, most notably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php#photo-9">Big Red</a> was spotted... wearing a blonde wig! Disguise or Halloween costume?</p>

<p>The Blue Oyster Cult-soundtracked installation will be turned back on tonight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/26/reminder_banksys_grim_reaper_is_bac.php">for one final round</a>, and it&apos;s almost guaranteed that&apos;s where you&apos;ll find the Garden Truck as well. This wasn&apos;t the first time two of the street artist&apos;s installations met this month&#x2014;in the past week the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php">Ronald McDonald</a> statue has been receiving visits from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/is_this_truck_filled_with_loud_stuf.php">Sirens of the Lambs</a> truck, creating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061657/https://twitter.com/jenist/statuses/392740053882904576">a Banksy Double Rainbow</a> for those who spot them.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It&apos;s a Banksy Triple Play tonight at the corner of Houston and Elzabeth&#x2014;the Sirens of the Lambs, the Garden Truck, and the Reaper are all there. Maybe Ronald will show up and take a spin on the bumper car?</p>
