title: Kanye West Doesn't Care About Press People
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="kanyewesttoday1110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120310124237im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/kanyewesttoday1110.jpg" width="275" height="212" class="image-right"> </span>Kanye West&apos;s headlines went into syndication this week, as news outlets revisited Taylor-Swift-gate and Bush-Doesn&apos;t-Care-About-Black-People-gate (yes, those things happened <em>long ago</em>). One of the reporters West found himself across from was Matt Lauer on the <em>Today</em> show, where he didn&apos;t like the way things were being run. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120310124237/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/kanye-west-says-he-wont-perform-concert-on-today/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a>, he taped the interview with Lauer, then preemptively criticized the program on Twitter. </p>

<p>West claims they &quot;tried to force my answers,&quot; and complained when the show played archival footage of the aforementioned incidents to prompt his reactions. The piece aired yesterday, and was followed by Lauer explaining that &quot;nothing unusual&quot; went on during the interview, and that he was looking forward to the rapper&apos;s performance on the show later this month. Or not...</p>

<p>West took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120310124237/http://twitter.com/#!/kanyewest">to Twitter</a> last night and declared: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not performing on the Today Show for obvious reasons. I&#x2019;m so happy the world got to see just a small piece of &#x2018;the set up.&#x2019; If I hadn&#x2019;t tweeted about how they set me up at the show they would have never played the extra footage that displayed how disrespectful. I want you guys to look at that footage and start to put everything together now.&quot; He signed off saying, &#x201C;Much love to Matt and the whole Today Show. I accept ya&#x2019;ll future apology in advance LOL!&#x201D;</p>

<p>NBC has confirmed the performance&#x2014;set for November 26th&#x2014;has been canceled... but as of now West is still confirmed to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120310124237/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/03/kanye.php">a part of the Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> (which, incidentally, airs on NBC and is usually hosted by the <em>Today</em> show folk). Below is the full <em>Today</em> show interview, do you think he should have apologized, or do you agree with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120310124237/http://twitter.com/#!/SarahKSilverman/status/2857324410568706">Sarah Silverman</a>, who said: &quot;I still feel Kanye saying &apos;George Bush doesn&apos;t care about black people&apos; was brave &amp; poignant &amp; reflected a moment in time&quot;?</p>
