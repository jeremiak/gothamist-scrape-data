The result was the hotel from soup to nuts. It&apos;s about the people that lived there, the ghosts, and the people that live there now. These artists need help and support.&quot;</blockquote>The documentary was just accepted in Cannes and includes fictionalized re-creations of events, interviews with former residents (Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Robert Crumb, Grace Jones and Milos Forman) as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811124636/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/19/video_of_the_da_88.php">current residents</a>. <p></p>

<p>The Hotel Chelsea bloggers were two of the current residents who had a camera crew setting up in their self-described &quot;tiny room&quot;. They reported at the time that &quot;when the equipment was all set up and Abel finally swept into the room, the first thing he did was to complement us on, of all things, making our bed&#x2014;apparently some of the people he had interviewed before us hadn&#x2019;t bothered!&quot; </p>

<p>Beyond the made beds, the film will delve into the messy truth -- that &quot;New York City has become a different place than what it was.&quot; Using the hotel as an example, Ferrara commented on how &quot;it was a place that wasn&apos;t run like a machine, it was run with heart. It&apos;s still a vital happening place, it&apos;s not a museum, although maybe some people would like to turn it into one.&quot;</p>
