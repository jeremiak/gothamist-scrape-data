title: Stoop Drinking Case Swept Under Rug

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0209stooplaw2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229224400im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0209stooplaw2.jpg" width="200" height="289" class="image-left"> </span>Kimber VanRy&apos;s name will surely go down in Brownstone Brooklyn history. After getting busted for drinking a Sierra Nevada on his own Sterling Place stoop last August, he stood up to the long arm of the law, and the law <em>didn&apos;t</em> win. Sadly, no one really won. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229224400/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/7/32_7_gk_kimber.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> catches up with Our Hero and finds out his case was actually dismissed on a technicality. They report that &quot;Judge Eugene Schwartzwald dismissed the case on Tuesday morning only because it &apos;took too long&apos; to get the case to trial.&quot; VanRy&#x2019;s lawyer isn&apos;t buying it however, and called out prosecutors for &quot;not bothering to show up to fight it out on the merits.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229224400/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/09/stoop_drinking_case_stalled.php">Earlier this month</a> the first judge assigned to the case stepped down. </p>

<p>Could it be that no one wants to touch the open-container law? Even Judge Schwartzwald told VanRy&#x2019;s lawyer that she &quot;did a nice job on the motion,&#x201D; which essentially argued that VanRy&apos;s stoop is set far enough back from the sidewalk. When VanRy was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229224400/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/29/stoop.php">originally ticketed</a>, the officer explained that if he were behind a fence or gate he would be okay, but the set-back stoop wasn&apos;t enough. Alas, as the warmer outdoor imbibing months creep up on us, the law is left with many a gray area (especially after Bloomberg himself declared that wine consumption at Central Park concerts was a-okay in 2003).</p>
