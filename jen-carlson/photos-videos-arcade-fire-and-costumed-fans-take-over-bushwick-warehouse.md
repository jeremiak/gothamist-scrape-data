</div></div>					<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027023629/http://gothamist.com/tags/arcadefire">Arcade Fire</a>, erm The Reflektors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027023629/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/tickets_for_arcade_fires_intimate_b.php">sold out</a> their two intimate Bushwick warehouse shows in under 10 seconds, give or take. Held at 299 Meserole over the weekend, attendees lucky enough to have gotten a golden ticket were told that &quot;formal attire or costume is mandatory!&quot; It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027023629/http://gothamist.com/2004/10/14/cmj_review_night_one_starring_the_arcade_fire.php">nine years</a> since we first saw them at CMJ, and these shows were a step back to that time&#x2014;a smaller venue, an intimately fun party, and not as much disconnect between band and audience. You know, like this...</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//web.archive.org/web/20141027023629if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/UJJHcduP0W4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>But then again, that totally makes sense for an up and coming band, such as The Reflektors. They arrived in a white stretch limo wearing their oversized caricature masks, as they had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027023629/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/videos_arcade_fire_threw_a_disco_pa.php">the night before</a>, and thoughtfully walked the length of the line, posing for photos with fans on their way in. Once inside, those who knew from the Friday night crowd that there was a decoy stage headed to the true stage&apos;s location, and waited there for about 90 minutes for the band to start&#x2014;a long enough wait that the heat caused many to complain (the previous night&apos;s crowd described the venue as &quot;a sweatbox&quot;). And when they did come on, it was James Murphy who introduced them again, this time in a tiger mask.</p>

<p>As with the night before, the band&apos;s set included mostly material from <em>Reflektor</em>. The only two songs from their expansive back catalog were &quot;Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)&quot; and &quot;Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains),&quot; which they introduced as a cover by a Merge Records band. </p>

<p>Towards the end of the night, Win Butler apologized to anyone who bought tickets from scalpers, but noted if there was anyone there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027023629/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/the_arcade_fire_tickets_you_didnt_g.php">who paid $5000</a> to get in that they&apos;re working with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027023629/http://PIH.org/">Partners in Health</a>, a hint that donations should be made to them.</p>

<p>We dispatched photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027023629/http://www.sachynmital.com/">Sachyn Mital</a> to the scene last night, click through for his photos of The Reflektors (n&#xE9;e Arcade Fire) and their costumed fans.</p>
