</div></div>					<p>Yesterday we looked at the newly renovated lobby of the Empire State Building, and all its Art Deco glory made us nostalgic. LIFE magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719040729/http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=empire+state+building+source:life&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=21">images</a> are often good for curing that; they even have a whole gallery of the building being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719040729/http://www.life.com/image/3199737/in-gallery/23044/empire-state-building-made-by-hand">made by hand</a>. Enough to make you reread <em>The Fountainhead</em>.</p>

<p>One of those men putting his blood, sweat and tears into the construction of the 1930&apos;s era building, however, was the first to kill himself by jumping off it before its completion. 29 more have followed since. Another was 23-year-old Evelyn McHale, whose 1947 plunge resulted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719040729/http://kottke.org/08/07/the-most-beautiful-suicide">the World&apos;s Most Beautiful Suicide</a>.</p>
