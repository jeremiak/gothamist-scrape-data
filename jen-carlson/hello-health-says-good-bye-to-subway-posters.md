<p>Yesterday there was some chatter about the Hello Health subway ad campaign, mainly how its empty word bubble design (unsurprisingly) acted as a magnet for vandals! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102316/http://animalnewyork.com/news/2008/08/mta-bursts-thoughtbubble-subwa.php">AnimalNY</a> mentioned that the MTA was responsible for pulling the ad campaign, which launched when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102316/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/29/dr_jay_parkison_and_williamsburg_sa.php">Hello Health opened</a> its doors in Williamsburg. Today, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102316/http://animalnewyork.com/news/2008/08/cbs-blatantly-lied-blamed-mta.php">they uncovered</a> that there was a little bit of finger pointing going on, and it was actually &quot;CBS Outdoor, the exclusive media managing agency for the MTA&apos;s entire system&quot; who requested the creative be changed.  </p>

<p>Why exactly the change was ordered is still unclear, but Hello Health will need to recreate another poster campaign for its six-month buy.  Maybe that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102316/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/21/subway_ad_mashu.php">subway poster mashup artist</a> needs to get involved!</p>
