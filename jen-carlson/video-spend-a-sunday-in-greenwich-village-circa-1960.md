<p>In 1960 Stewart Wilensky spent the summer in New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527195320/http://seanwilentz.com/2010/08/05/greenwich-village-sunday-1960/">filming a documentary</a> about it, which ended up being narrated by &quot;legendary radio humorist and raconteur&quot; Jean Shepherd. As the camera rolls showing scenes from Greenwich Village, Shepherd says things like: &quot;With the passage of time, more and more of the old Village landmarks are being chipped away and replaced, but the ones that remain&#x2014;the old studios, the converted stables, the carriage houses, and the last of the city&apos;s gaslights&#x2014;are visible reminders of an earlier chapter in the history of New York.&quot; <em>Sigh</em>.</p>

<p>Make sure to watch til the end, where you&apos;ll catch beat poet Ted Joans reading his poetry in a coffee house.</p>
