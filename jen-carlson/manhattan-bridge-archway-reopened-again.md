<p>Last September the Manhattan Bridge Archway in DUMBO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115231306/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/08/manhattan_bridge_archway_opens.php">reopened</a> after 17 years, only to be promptly closed again with further renovations for the $500K project. Yesterday the gates were finally taken down for an unofficial unveiling. The safety orange adornments that lined the walls upon last glance are now down (phew), and there&apos;s likely some more work to be done, but now locals won&apos;t have to pass through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115231306/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/08/manhattan_bridge_archway_opens.php?gallery0Pic=5#gallery">Stabber Alley</a> anymore. Upon completion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115231306/http://www.dumbonyc.org/index.php?route=res|current_initiatives&amp;id=3">the archway</a> is accessible 24 hours a day, will house some special events and is &quot;for public, non-vehicular use&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141115231306/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/08/free_parking_under_the_manhattan_br.php">ahem</a>).</p>
