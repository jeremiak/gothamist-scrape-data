title: East Village Locals Glue Rocks To Planters In NIMBY-est Move Ever
---

	
										<p>Superiority Burger, home to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016154351/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/30/the_worlds_most_famous_veggie_burge.php">a much-hyped veggie burger</a>, opened up at 430 East 9th Street last week. The space is small (this is where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016154351/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/original_dirt_candy_to_close_in_aug.php">the original Dirt Candy</a> was housed), and the hype really is big, so the crowds are turning up. And where better to enjoy your dinner than a comfy tree bench on the somewhat sleepy stretch of the street? Not so fast...</p>

<p>Neighbors welcomed the restaurant and its patrons by promptly gluing rocks down to the wooden tree benches, which appear to be homemade (unlike a tree guard provided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016154351/http://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/tree-care/tree-guards">the Parks Department</a>). At least one employee witnessed this happening the morning after opening night, and our photographer Scott Lynch caught this woman red-handed.</p>

<p>The tree bed is not a privately owned space, though locals do tend to... tend to them. (You can request your own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016154351/http://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/street-tree-planting">right here</a>.) We&apos;ve reached out the Parks Department for their comment on the aggressive-aggressive move, and will update if we hear back. For now, maybe bring a pillow in retaliation.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Spotted this afternoon&#x2014;a &quot;No Bikes&quot; stencil has been added to the tableau.</p>
