<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="phpKQCN7MAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124314im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpKQCN7MAM.jpg" width="250" height="166"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">NYPL destroyed in <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em></span></i></div> In the battle between the West and East Coast cities, Los Angeles may just beat New York... at least on film. Remember when they blew up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124314/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/08/bloodthirsty_va.php">the Brooklyn Bridge</a>? New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124314/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/17/new_york_flips.php">did not like that</a>.<p></p>

<p>If you&apos;re into seeing the city destroyed on celluloid, however, check out Hollywood wreak havoc on Manhattan through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124314/http://www.goodiebag.tv/2009/11/hollywood-vs-new-york/">these movie scenes</a>. The destructo-porn montage is set to the tune of Gershwin&apos;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue,&quot; and comprised from movies like <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>, <em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, <em>Independence Day</em>, and yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124314/http://gothamist.com/tags/cloverfield"><em>Cloverfield</em></a>.</p>
