<p>Back in 2010 we stumbled upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224110/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/20/video_hipsters_falling_on_ice.php">this video</a> of people (some call them <em>&quot;hipsters&quot;</em>) falling on a patch of ice at North 12th and Bedford in Williamsburg. We thought it was amusing since no one seemed to be seriously injured by their tumbles, <em>plus</em> it was expertly soundtracked by The Pixies and Beck.</p>

<p>Shortly after we posted it, the person behind the record button, Paul McKenna, took the video down, because of &quot;the negative comments it was receiving on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224110/http://gothamist.com/">your site</a>.&quot; This left us to live in &quot;a world where our children, and children&apos;s children, will never get to see hipsters [ed. note&#x2014;in 2012, they are now pretty much an extinct species] falling on ice.&quot; <em>Or so we thought.</em></p>

<p>The video popped back into our heads earlier this week when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224110/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/video_subway_stairs.php"><em>this</em> video of people falling on subway stairs</a> was released... and lo and behold, it turns out sometime between 2010 and now, McKenna had handed his video over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224110/http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/edc5b4ac7c/hipsters-falling-on-ice">Funny or Die</a>. So here it is, the vintage 2010 masterpiece &quot;Hipsters Falling On Ice&quot;:</p>
