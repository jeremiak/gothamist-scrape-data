										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="SMmtvlogo1112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013119im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SMmtvlogo1112.jpeg" width="325" height="263" class="image-right"> </span>No one loves bitching about MTV not playing music videos anymore than those born in the 1970s and 1980s. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve been slowly revisiting each of the network&apos;s good years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013119/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/26/mtv_1981.php">starting from the beginning</a>&#x2014;we just want to <em>feel alive</em> again in a world where <em>16 And Pregnant</em> has taken the place of EPIC MUSICAL VIDEOS like &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013119/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbUC-UaAxE">November Rain</a>.&quot; But how did we get here&#x2014;why did everything have to change? While many may blame the reality television boom for the ultimate demise of the original MTV programming format, in the below video one man* tells us that <em>we brought it all upon ourselves</em>.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Are you fucking kidding me? Should we ALL preserve your precious sleepover moments spent watching promotional materials for record labels... the answer is: fuck you. Music videos were only worth making if they had actual promotional power behind them. And the game has changed. YOUR generation&#x2014;not the one before you, not the one after you&#x2014;decided to steal music. And music videos are more worthless than ever before.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>So really, like with so many things, it&apos;s the millennials&apos; fault. Whatever, long live <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013119/http://www.vh1.com/music/vh1classic/main.jhtml">VH1 Classic</a>.</p>

<p>And seriously, &quot;November Rain&quot; was really good: </p>

<p>*This is obviously COMEDY and not real, which we didn&apos;t think we had to point out here, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013119/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/12/why_doesnt_mtv_play_music_videos_an.php#comment-708504139">but apparently we do</a>! </p>
