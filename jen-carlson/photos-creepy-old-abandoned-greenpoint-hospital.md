</div></div>					<p>Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144450/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2010/10/greenpoint-hospital-nurses-residence.html">Nate Kensinger</a> has photos of a real haunted house* in Brooklyn: the Greenpoint Hospital. Built in 1914, it was in operation through 1982, and currently seven towers on the grounds are used as apartments, a homeless shelter, and a new community space. This is a story about the one abandoned building, however: the former nurses residence. The building has seen lots of blood in its day, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144450/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/nyregion/24serpico.html">reportedly</a> on February 3rd, 1971 &quot;Frank Serpico&apos;s inert, blood soaked form was wheeled into the Emergency Room.&quot; The site may be developed soon, so Kensinger&apos;s photos could be a last look at what is likely to become affordable residential units.</p>

<p><span class="photo_caption">*Unsubstantiated! But it might be haunted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144450/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CQxI0Yhn97w/TMZHLGvOQ_I/AAAAAAAACbs/7lZX2SgHv6s/s1600/DSC_1610+small.jpg">this dead pigeon</a> Kensinger photographed.</span></p>
