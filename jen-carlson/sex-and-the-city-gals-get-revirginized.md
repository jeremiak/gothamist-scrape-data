Get excited, they&apos;re <em>Sex and the City</em> prequels! </p>

<p>Titled <em>The Carrie Diaries</em>, they&apos;ll take readers &quot;back to <strong>Carrie Bradshaw&apos;s formative years in high school, giving an inside look at Carrie&apos;s friendships, romances and how she realized her dream of becoming a writer.</strong>&quot; According to the undoubtedly accurate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145216/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Bradshaw">Wikipedia entry</a> on the fictional character, she&apos;s been living in Manhattan since age 17, and upon her arrival she &quot;wore Candie&apos;s and took the subway.&quot; <em>Incroyable!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145216/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/archives/2008/10/sex_and_the_cit_3.php">Michael Musto</a> looks at the inevitable movie and/or television series these books will birth, and notes that &quot;<strong>Bushnell has said she fancies the possibility of Miley Cyrus as Carrie.</strong>&quot; He includes his own casting, opining that Dakota Fanning would make a great Miranda.</p>

<p>That lady in blue to the left is the real Sarah Jessica Parker in her formative years, who would you cast?</p>
