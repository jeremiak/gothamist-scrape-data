title: Video: Discovering the Flushing Pimp

										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161033/http://vimeo.com/7538312">WNYC &quot;Radio Rookies&quot;</a> recently went on a search for the &quot;Flushing Pimp,&quot; whom many have consistently seen on the streets in Queens throughout the years (he&apos;s even got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161033/http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&amp;gid=2397277645">Facebook page</a> dedicated to him). Their search took some dark turns, however, when they ultimately found out through his sister that he died, after battling spinal cancer, lung cancer and two brain tumors. He was also allegedly schizophrenic, which was triggered after his mom died when he was 19. So, while this isn&apos;t as whimsical as we&apos;d hoped, it&apos;s sweet he&apos;s been given a posthumous tribute.</p>
