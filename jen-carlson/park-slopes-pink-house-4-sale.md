<p>Step right up, this beauty could be yours. Owner Bernie Henry coated his four-story brownstone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144929/http://www.heightsberkeley.com/index.cfm?page=details&amp;id=1316">on Garfield Place</a> with this Pepto-pink color just three years ago (about 47 years after he moved in). The retired tailor told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144929/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/10/13/2009-10-13_pink_its_time_to_move.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;I&apos;m 92. It&apos;s time to get rid of it. It&apos;s a lot of money to keep it up ... I&apos;m going to buy a smaller house around the corner.&quot; He says his new home will not get the same color treatment; in fact, he tells the paper he never meant to paint this one in such a garish hue, saying: &quot;They sent me the wrong paint. It was painted this color accidentally.&quot;</p>
