<p>As a part of greening up the earth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164818/http://maps.google.com/help/maps/transit/index.html#utm_campaign=en&amp;utm_medium=et&amp;utm_source=en-et-na-us-gns-trs&amp;utm_term=TransitHomepage">Google Transit</a> will tell you the quickest way to get from Point A to B using mass transit in the city. </p>

<p>We tried it out, starting out at 4 Times Square and ending at 770 Broadway; one might think taking the N/Q/R/W would be the quickest route -- but that person would be <em>wrong</em>. Apparently the best way to do this is by using your own two feet; Google says walk it! Not a bad idea, but perhaps this option is showing up because, despite Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164818/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/19/gothamist_goes_to_google.php">having major office space</a> in NYC, they haven&apos;t fully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164818/http://www.google.com/transit">translated our transit system</a> yet. </p>

<p>New Yorkers can map how they&apos;re helping out the earth today, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164818/http://www.google.com/earthday08">right here</a>. So far locals have been encouraging others to &quot;use mugs instead of plastic cups,&quot; and one is organizing &quot;a week long festival of Earth friendly activities at SUNY Potsdam.&quot; </p>
