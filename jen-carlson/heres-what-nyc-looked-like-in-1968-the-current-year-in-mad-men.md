</div></div>					<p>Last night&apos;s <em>Mad Men</em> season six premiere was set in December 1967, ending with a shot of Don picking up the paper on the morning of January 1st, 1968&#x2014;the front page headline reads: &quot;World Bids Adieu To A Violent Year; City Gets Snowfall.&quot; This was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429221907/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60F1EFA3B55157493C3A9178AD85F4C8685F9">the real front page headline</a> of the NY Times on that day, but the first half carries a hint of wishful thinking, as 1968 was marked with demonstrations, more racial tension, and assassinations.</p>

The mind-boggling occurrences seemed to come out of nowhere, like the Viet Cong who set off a depth charge beneath the Johnson presidency with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429221907/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive">the Tet offensive</a> at the end of January.&quot;</p>
