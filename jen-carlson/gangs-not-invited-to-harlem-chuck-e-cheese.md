<p>Is Chuck E. Cheese a hotbed of criminal activity? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140220001652/http://afinecompany.blogspot.com/2010/03/harlem-chuckee-cheese-experience-starts.html">Andrew Fine</a> took his young daughter to their outpost in Harlem recently and did a double-take when he saw the list of rules posted at the front door. They include: No gang style apparel&#x2014;including hats, buckles, bandanas, towels. And of course, &quot;No gang-type conduct... verbal slogans or hand signs&quot; and absolutely &quot;no weapons, or tools whatsoever, including knives, chains, screwdrivers, glass cutters.&quot; What happened at the Harlem Chuck E. Cheese to warrant the placement of such a sign! We&apos;ve contacted the company to find out if the place &quot;where a kid can be a kid&quot; has a problem with violence; in the past <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140220001652/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122878081364889613.html">this one in Wisconsin</a> has been called out for being a stage for adult bad behavior.</p>
