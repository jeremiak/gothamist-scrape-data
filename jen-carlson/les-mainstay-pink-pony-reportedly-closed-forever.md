So far word on the street has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902024818/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/17/is_the_soho_house_opening_on_the_lo.php">SoHo House opening up</a>; Piano&apos;s expanding; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902024818/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/29/pianos_expanding_the_living_room_mo.php">the Living Room moving</a> elsewhere. The latest blow came this morning when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902024818/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2013/02/pink-pony-on-ludlow-closes-for-good/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Bowery Boogie</a> reported that mainstay no-frills eatery Pink Pony has closed indefinitely. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The pioneering Lower East Side hang at 176 Ludlow closed a couple weeks ago under cover of darkness, seemingly not to return. Sources confirm closure, while calls for comment are met without success. Yes, the Pink Pony phone number was also disconnected. We all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902024818/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/08/max_fish_les_mainstay_closing_by_en.php">knew this day would eventually arrive</a>, especially after the famed compromise of January 2011 in which a favorable rent deal was struck between the landlord and neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902024818/http://gothamist.com/tags/maxfish">Max Fish</a>, who subleased the adjacent restaurant space to Pink Pony. At that moment, the extension granted was only for a year so both were living on borrowed time.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>When do we start a Lower East Side Deathwatch Pool for the remaining establishments in the area? At least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902024818/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/04/lolita_bar_on_broome_to_get_new_own.php">Lolita is safe</a>, for the moment.</p>
