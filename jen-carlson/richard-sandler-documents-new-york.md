</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429005408/http://www.tankboy.com/richard">Richard Sandler</a>, a New York documentarian, has sent along some photographs from his decade-spanning collection. Sandler will also be screening two of his documentaries about the city later this month. The first, <em>Brave New York</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429005408/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6laaikeO6Ys">watch online</a>), &quot;is a free form documentary that loosely chronicles the last 12 years of intense change in the East Village. From the reopening of a newly curfewed Tompkins Square Park to the destruction of the cherished Loisaida Community Gardens, to the first yuppie invasions of the dot com years, to the present.&quot; The second film, called <em>Sway</em>, goes underground--it&apos;s another free-form video in which 14 years of camcorder-recorded subway rides have been edited together.</p>

<p>Catch those for free on August 22nd at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429005408/http://www.6bgarden.org/">the 6B garden</a>. For now, here&apos;s a look at a different era of New York through Sandler&apos;s lens (he also has photographs on view at the Brooklyn Museum as part of their permanent collection).</p>
