<p>That iconic ivory dress that Marilyn Monroe wore above a Lexington Avenue subway grate back in 1954 is back in the spotlight, as it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033555/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2011/06/marilyn-monroes-subway-dress-from-the-seven-year-itch-among-items-in-june-18-auction.html">heads to the auction block</a>. The dress is currently in the hands of Debbie Reynolds, who bought it back in 1974 for $200, but on June 18th it&apos;ll be headed to an auction house in Beverly Hills, where it&apos;s expected to take in nearly $2 million. And some are trying to get it back to New York City. </p>

<p>The dress really is just as much West as it is East Coast, as many of those shots in the <em>Seven Year Itch</em> were filmed on a soundstage in Hollywood (here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033555/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/06/movie_flashback.php#photo-1">the New York shot</a>, here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033555/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/06/movie_flashback.php#photo-2">the Hollywood shot</a>). However, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033555/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110602/murray-hill-gramercy/marilyn-monroe-fans-want-bring-iconic-dress-nyc#ixzz1O87CTFCu">DNAInfo</a>, a group of New Yorkers wants that dress back in the city, and have started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033555/http://savethedress.org/">Save The Dress</a> campaign&#x2014;yesterday they even stood with a mannequin wearing a replica of the dress at the Lexington Avenue spot, trying to bring some attention to their cause. Darlene Newman, who&apos;s spearheading the campaign, says, &quot;We want to make sure it stays in New York and goes to a good home. It should be in a museum like the Smithsonian, but in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday would have been Monroe&apos;s 85th birthday, and a rep for designer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033555/http://www.marilynmonroe.ca/camera/galleries/costumes/travilla/">William Travilla</a>&apos;s estate says he considered it a &quot;silly little dress. But Marilyn adored it. It made her an international icon.&quot;</p>
