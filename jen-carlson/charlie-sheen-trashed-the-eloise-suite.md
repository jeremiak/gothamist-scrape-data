										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="eloisesheen.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013905im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/eloisesheen.jpg" width="300" height="303" class="image-left"> </span>The naked woman found locked inside of Charlie Sheen&apos;s Plaza Hotel suite&apos;s closet (it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013905/http://www.fairmont.com/theplaza/HotelPackages/Family/Eloise+Suite.htm">the Eloise suite</a>, btw!) was, unsurprisingly, an escort. She called the police a little before 2 a.m. when the actor (who was also naked) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013905/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/26/emotionally_disturbed_charlie_sheen.php">began to lash out</a> and trashed the place. He voluntarily admitted himself to a hospital with ex-wife Denise Richards by his side; the two were sharing a vacation in New York with their children, who were also in the hotel (but in a different room) at the time.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013905/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/10/26/2010-10-26_charlie_sheen_trashes_plaza_hotel_suite_during_drunk_rage_before_being_taken_awa.html#ixzz13UXaELIJ">the Daily News</a>, Sheen was on a &quot;booze-and-blow binge&quot; (something he admitted to) but his publicist has since spinned the story saying, &quot;Charlie had an adverse allergic reaction to some medication and was taken to the hospital.&quot; This isn&apos;t the first time Sheen has found himself in trouble, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013905/http://www.tmz.com/2010/10/26/charlie-sheen-die-death-hospitalized-drunk-naked-hotel-room-911-call/">reportedly</a> his friends have been worried that he&apos;s going to die if he keeps this up.</p>

<p>Sheen is now getting ready to board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013905/http://www.tmz.com/2010/10/26/charlie-sheen-fly-back-to-los-angeles-hospitalized-hotel-room-naked-drunk-jet/">a private jet</a> back to L.A., and as for the woman in the closet... police sources say she&apos;s a &quot;semi-pro... a woman who likes the celebrities, likes the gifts and not averse to taking some cash on the side as a &apos;thank you.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013905/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20437001,00.html">Denise Richards</a> was on the Howard Stern Show, and simply told the host: &quot;It&apos;s been an eventful trip!&quot;</p>
