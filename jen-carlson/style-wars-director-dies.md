										<p>Director of the legendary hip-hop documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428163211/http://stylewars.com/"><em>Style Wars</em></a>, Tony Silver, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428163211/http://www.metafilter.com/68734/RIP-Tony-Silver-director-of-Style-Wars">died last weekend</a> after battling an irreversible brain condition for several years. </p>

<p>Shot in New York City in the early &apos;80s and originally airing on PBS in 1983, his documentary is considered to be the first film about hip-hop culture. While the 70 minutes covers rap and breakdancing, its main focus is on graffiti, which at the time was viewed by some as a groundbreaking art form. <em>Style Wars</em> shows an altered urban landscape and serves as a snapshot of life here in the early &apos;80s, with a &quot;cast&quot; ranging from Mayor Koch to renowned graffiti taggers to the Rock Steady Crew to subway maintenance workers. Check out the original trailer (and the full 70 minutes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428163211/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5065949310221269915">here</a>): </p>
