</div></div>					<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228120558/http://www.scoutingny.com/">Scouting NYC</a> is a website run by an anonymous location scout in New York. The site explains: &quot;My day is basically spent combing the streets for interesting and unique locations for feature films. In my travels, I often stumble across some pretty incredible sights, most of which are ignored every day by thousands of New Yorkers in too much of a rush to pay attention.&quot; Now anonyscout keeps a record of all the nooks the rest of us may not be seeing, and took some time off the beaten path to answer our questions about the job, the city and what the rest of us are missing.</em></p>

<p><strong>How long have you been scouting locations in New York?</strong> I&apos;ve been scouting for about 4 years now. It&apos;s a great way to see the workings of big budget filmmaking if you&apos;re a wannabe filmmaker like myself. On a typical film production, Locations is one of the first departments to be hired and last to be fired, so you&apos;re there from the very start to the bitter end.</p>

<p><strong>Can you say what shows or movies you&apos;ve worked on?</strong> There have been a lot - I&apos;ve worked on films with Will Smith, Adam Sandler, Tobey Maguire, John Travolta, Tom Cruise, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ben Stiller, Denzel Washington, lots of others.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the process after you find a location?</strong> Before anything else, find the owner.  This can sometimes be harder than actually finding the location.  People get very suspicious in New York when you start asking for the owner, because they assume you have a complaint, or you want to sue or something. It kills me, because we&apos;re just looking to pay them a lot of money for doing very little. Often, the owners aren&apos;t even in New York - I recently tracked down the owner of a random apartment in the Village, who turned out to be an &quot;ice cream magnate&quot; living in Arizona.</p>

<p>After we get a tentative &quot;we&apos;d consider filming&quot; from the owner, we take the director on a scout to see the locations we&apos;ve found. Once he chooses one (usually after seeing 20-40 possibilities), we make a deal, start prep work, and eventually go and shoot.</p>
