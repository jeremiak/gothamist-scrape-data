This year he brings his know-how offline with the most massive flea market Brooklyn has seen, aptly called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623004831/http://www.brownstoner.com//brooklynflea">Brooklyn Flea</a>. While honing our haggling skills, we asked him a few questions about what to expect when it opens this weekend. </em></p>

<p><strong>How, and when, did you come up with the idea for Brooklyn Flea?</strong> I was a regular visitor to the old 26th Street flea markets back in the old days of the 1990s. It struck me last year that Brooklyn of all places should have a kick-ass flea market so I decided to dip my toe into the water with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623004831/http://www.flickr.com/photos/brownstoner/sets/72157601937478261">Salvage Fest</a> (a one-day outdoor market for architectural salvage I put on at PS 11 in Clinton Hill) last September. </p>

<p>When that went well, I thought, What the heck, and decided that if I were going to do it, I might as well think big.</p>

<p><strong>Can you give us all the details?</strong> 10am to 5 pm every Sunday in the schoolyard at the Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School at 176 Lafayette Avenue in Fort Greene.</p>

<p><strong>Do brownstone Brooklynites really need more stuff?</strong> Of course--we tend to have a little more space than Manhattanites.</p>

<p><strong>Does this put you head-to-head with the Park Slope flea market?</strong> Not to take anything away from the Park Slope flea market, but we&apos;re doing this on a completely different level. Brooklyn Flea will have close to 200 vendors a week, a group that has been heavily curated from over 800 applicants; hopefully it will attract visitors from all five boroughs and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s been the biggest obstacle you&apos;ve had putting this together?</strong> I think we are the only flea market ever to actually file plans with, and undergo the scrutiny of, the Department of Buildings. They were very hands-on in helping us get everything in order, but it certainly added a great deal of time and expense to the process. But I didn&apos;t want to build a franchise on a house of cards.</p>
