One reader tips us off to a new South Side stabber who may have the 90th Precinct working overtime. Ladies, hipsters, et al, even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111109030203/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/07/mclovin_and_mat.php">Matchbox 20 and McLovin</a> were bro-ing down south of the Williamsburg Bridge &#x2013; <em>the ultimate sign of gentrification</em> &#x2013; you still need to buddy up on those evening walks. A tipster writes:</p><blockquote>There is a man stabbing women in and around Williamsburg. They are stopping everyone possible simply so they can run everyone&apos;s licenses looking for the priors that will most likely mark their man.<p></p>

<p>Seems they have even brought in officers from other precincts to assist in the insane amounts of foot patrol.</p></blockquote>Some less concerned residents of the area note that one may want to watch their back not from the stabber, but the police themselves.<blockquote>A dude in my building told me he got a $120 ticket for jaywalking across S. 3rd btwn Roebling and Havemeyer aka a totally sleepy, one way residential street.</blockquote>We called the NYPD to verify and they couldn&apos;t confirm anything, while the 90th Precinct was unable to give out any information.<p></p>
