<p>The Museum of Modern Art&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104557/http://moma.org/partyinthegarden2016">annual Party in the Garden</a> is taking place on June 1st, and while none of us can afford the dinner, the afterparty is always the place to be.</p>

<p>The afterparty, which starts at the reasonable hour of 9 p.m., features a heavenly display of open bars set up throughout the sculpture garden (you&apos;ll find some snacks around the spacious grounds as well), but the main attraction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104557/http://gothamist.com/tags/gardenparty">is the musical guest</a>. And this year it&apos;s Robyn. THE ROBYN. Everyone loves Robyn. </p>

<p>The cost of seeing human artwork Robyn play to an intimate group in the sculpture garden of one of the best museums in the city, while drinking (open bar) top shelf alcohol for several hours, is $225. More than your average concert, but the appeal here is that this isn&apos;t the average concert. VIP tickets will grant the ticketholder access to The Modern restaurant until 1 a.m., on top of everything else, and will cost $525.</p>

<p>This year&apos;s gala will honor Huma Bhabha, Mark Bradford, Amanda and Glenn Fuhrman, Sally and Wynn Kramarsky, and Brice Marden for their artistry and philanthropy. who prior to this afterparty will be dining at a $2,500 a head dinner party. All proceeds go to MoMA&apos;s Annual Fund and the maintenance of The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104557/http://moma.org/partyinthegarden2016">purchase tickets here</a>.</p>
