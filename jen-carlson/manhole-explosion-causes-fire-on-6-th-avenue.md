</div></div>					<p>Just before noon a reader wrote in from 6th Avenue and 20th Street saying, &quot;Lots of emergency vehicles. People in the street. Smoke billowing out the north side (20th st.) of the building. 6th ave traffic messed up.&quot; Word over the newswire was the fire, at 641 6th Avenue, was sparked by a manhole explosion. Another reader, who works in that building, told us they were evacuated because of a fire in the subway; she also notes a &quot;huge fireball&quot; reached the 5th floor. Con Ed and the FDNY are on the scene. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004147/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/nyc/100211-manhole-explosion-starts-major-fire">Fox 5 NY</a>, the incident took place around 11:30 a.m. and &quot;the front of a Radio Shack store was smoldering in the aftermath. There was damage to several floor above the store.&quot; The FDNY told them it was a manhole explosion that sparked the transformer fire. No injuries have been reported, but Radio Shack, Bally&apos;s Total Fitness and Apex Technical School have all been damaged. Currently 6th Avenue between West 14th and 20th streets is closed.</p>
