										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpijLGy2AM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712160919im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpijLGy2AM.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Today Vanity Fair released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712160919/https://twitter.com/VanityFair/status/643459713561141248">the above image</a>, along with an accompanying feature in which they &quot;talked to all the titans of late-night television.&quot; Titans, in Greek mythology, were a race of gods. Today, a titan is merely god-<em>like</em>, but they&apos;re still the most influential and important, albeit mortal humans, in their fields.</p>

<p>There are zero women in that photo and in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712160919/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/late-night-tv-colbert-fallon-kimmel?mbid=social_twitter">the Vanity Fair feature</a>, which is titled: &quot;Why Late-Night Television Is Better than Ever.&quot; We&apos;d also point out that if this photo had been taken earlier this year, before Trevor Noah was announced as the guy taking over Jon Stewart&apos;s seat at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712160919/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedailyshow"><em>The Daily Show</em></a>, and without Larry Wilmore, this would be a photo of all white males.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t to say that Jimmy Fallon, Conan O&#x2019;Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Maher, James Corden, Larry Wilmore, John Oliver, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah aren&apos;t funny, smart, and deserving of their programs, but there are plenty of women that are also deserving of these programs. </p>

<p>This glaring image of a late night world stuck in another era comes a week after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712160919/http://splitsider.com/2015/09/17-men-2-women-colberts-writers-room-shows-that-nothings-changed-in-late-night/">Splitsider</a> criticized Colbert (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712160919/http://splitsider.com/2015/08/stephen-colbert-vows-that-late-show-will-celebrate-womens-voices/">Colbert</a>!) for only including 2 women in his writers room. There are 17 men. </p>

<p>Of course, it&apos;s not Vanity Fair&apos;s fault that there is absolutely no diversity in the late night world, but perhaps they could have pointed out their absence, instead of celebrating uniformity. Oh wait, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712160919/http://fusion.net/story/197133/an-annotated-guide-to-this-extremely-diverse-photo-of-late-night-hosts-in-vanity-fair/">Colbert wore plaid</a>, so nevermind.</p>
