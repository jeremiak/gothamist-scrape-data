										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="vendingmachineapple.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170637im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/vendingmachineapple.jpg" width="200" height="289" class="image-right"> </span>Okay, so the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170637/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/03/bye_bye_bake_sales.php">school Bake Sale</a> is on its way out, and with that the kiddies vending machines will also be trimmed of their fat. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170637/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/nyregion/07contract.html?ref=nyregion">The NY Times</a> reports that under their new regulations the Department of Education are stocking up schools with healthier choices; &quot;New vending machine contracts expected to be approved on Wednesday could mean less junk food &#x2014; and less money for schools.&quot;</p>

<p>One contract will require that drinks sold in elementary and middle schools have less than 10 calories per eight ounces; in high schools it&apos;s 25 calories or less per eight ounces. On top of that, no artificial sweetener is allowed, and drinks will have to be caffeine-free or non-carbonated. As for snacks, there will be calorie, fat and sugar content limits.</p>

<p>The schools will take around the same cut as they have in the past, 30% of the revenue&#x2014;however, they fear that healthier options will lead to fewer sales. One critic of the new policy asks: &#x201C;If they were so concerned with student health, why would they focus on this instead of making sure that all students have a basic gym class?&#x201D; Or, like, both!</p>
