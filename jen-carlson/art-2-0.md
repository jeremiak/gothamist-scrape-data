Including how the nature of online practice has changed over Internet art&apos;s first decade.</p>

<p>Excuse us as we ask ourselves quixotically, &quot;Internet art?</p>

<p>Apparently over the past 10 years Internet-based art has transformed, moving towards a more loose and dispersed range of conceptual pieces (ie: it&apos;s not just animated gifs anymore!). According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120126120939/http://www.eai.org/eai/02_06_rhizome_pr.html">events&apos; site</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;This development has, in large part, to do with the expanded and diversified terrain of the Web itself. What was previously a thin network of interlinked pages, construction signs, and awkward animated gifs is now a sprawling area, home to some of the best new business models, largest communities, and billions of users both amateur and expert---a second stage some call the &quot;Web 2.0.&quot; Now, artists working on or drawing source material from the Internet face not only a faster, richer, more complicated landscape, but also one whose parameters for art practice are continually being pushed out by artists and non-artists alike.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Panelists will discuss everthing internet, including blogging, online video gaming and the challenge of getting internet art in to museums.  </p>

<p><em>Tonight // 6:30pm // Electronic Arts Intermix (EAI) [535 West 22nd St, 5th Floor]</em></p>
