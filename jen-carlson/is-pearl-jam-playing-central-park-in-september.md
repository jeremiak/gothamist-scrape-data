<p>Recently a scrappy group of Pearl Jam fans has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042658/http://www.pearljamforesthills.com/">trying to raise money</a> for the band to play at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens. They raised around $142,000. Is that enough to get them? Probably not. However, the band just tweeted out this cryptic photo hinting at a NYC show. </p>

<p>One of the organizers behind the Forest Hills effort, Daniel Sheffer, told us this likely had nothing to do with them. So what, then? Will the band rebuild Tower Records and recreate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042658/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/video_watch_pearl_jam_play_at_a_yon.php">their 1991 in-store performance</a>? If only. </p>

<p>Most likely, Sheffer believes they&apos;ve been added to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042658/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/artists/pearl-jam/">the Global Citizens Fest</a> coming to Central Park on September 26th. But so far, that&apos;s just speculation. So far <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042658/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/save-the-date-global-citizen-festival-2015-on-sept/">Ed Sheeran</a> seems to be the only confirmed musician.</p>
