<p>Bushwick is getting an adorable new pancake house (BYO Artisinal Syrup!). IHOP is making good on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101700/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/09/ihop_coming_to_times_square_24_othe.php#photo-4">their promise</a> to bring 24 of their fine dining establishments to NYC. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101700/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/12/there_is_a_god_ihop_coming_soon_to.php">The East Village</a> has already got their pancake-slinging storefront, and faster than you can say &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101700/http://ihop.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=231&amp;Itemid=2">Rooty Tooty Fresh &#x2018;n Fruity</a>,&quot; their Bushwick outpost will soon be <em>fully operational.</em> Today, AnimalNY&apos;s own Bucky Turco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101700/http://twitpic.com/6dke4w">spotted the progress</a> at the pancake house on Flushing Avenue. Once it opens, don&apos;t wait too long to check it out; it&apos;s only a matter of time before Sam Sifton drops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101700/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/ny_times_drops_two_stars_on_roberta.php"> two stars</a> on the place and it&apos;s impossible to get a booth. </p>
