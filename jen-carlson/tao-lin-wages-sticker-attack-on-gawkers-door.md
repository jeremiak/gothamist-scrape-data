I just want you to know that because of your ill-conceived self-marketing strategy, you have 100% guaranteed that I will never read your damned book. You&apos;re maybe perhaps the single most irritating person we&apos;ve ever had to deal with.&quot; They added that his stunts are &quot;retarded&quot; and &quot;deceptive.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it took Lin nearly a year to plan his retaliation; his weapon: a fallen pop star. This morning Gawker employees reached their office only to be greeted by a door laden with Lin&apos;s promotional paraphernalia: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040831/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/22/tao.php">Britney Spears stickers</a>, most likely applied by his &quot;army of interns&quot; in the hopes of getting some press for his new book.

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Did Tao Lin steal the Britney idea? A reader writes in: &quot;There is a free East Village newspaper (struggling, printed on brown paper) I grabbed in a downtown Mexican bakery on 1st Ave between 4th and 5th. On the top was a banner to advertise in that paper which read: &apos;Britney Spears -- now that we&apos;ve got your attention, why not advertise with us.&apos; Tao Lin Totally ripped it off that&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The receptionist has been charged with the duty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040831/http://jdel.tumblr.com/post/37182563/nickmcglynn-i-hope-whoever-put-all-those-stickers">peeling off the stickers</a>. </p>
