Rogerson says he&apos;s &quot;researched the origins of current and past Manhattan street names&quot; for his guide, which will be an &quot;alphabetical, informative reference work for anyone interested in New York City and its history.&quot;</p>

<p>You&apos;ll find out why Houston Street isn&apos;t pronounced like the city in Texas, as well as where to find Oyster Pasty Alley, Dirty Lane, and the Golden Hill. But until you can hold that in your hands, you can follow along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405034148/http://www.manhattanpast.com/">on his blog</a>, where recently Rogerson revisited Marketfield Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405034148/http://www.manhattanpast.com/2012/marketfield-street/">Do you know where that is</a>?</p>
