<p>The Russian drug Krokodil (chemically known as desomorphine) is a homemade heroin alternative that has made its way to the States from Russia, and it&apos;s now entered New York City. Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160416155427/http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/09/26/the-most-horrifying-drug-in-the-world-comes-to-the-u-s/?iid=obnetwork">Time magazine</a> called it &quot;the most horrifying drug in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Before we go local, here&apos;s a primer: Krokodil was given its street name because of its nightmarish after effects. The drug&#x2014;which also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160416155427/http://chicagoist.com/2013/10/10/russian_drug_krokodil_found_in_will.php">turned up in Illinois</a> recently&#x2014;will turn your skin scaly and green/yellow like a crocodile, it will then cause it to &quot;harden, rot, and fall off,&quot; often in chunks. After that, you&apos;ll likely die&#x2014;the average life expectancy for a user is around two years. It&apos;s not pretty:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sal Ramirez, who witnessed krokodil being used while serving in the Peace Corps in Kazakhstan, says he saw a man being thrown out of Le Bain, one of New York&#x2019;s hottest clubs, after attempting to peddle krokodil. Ramirez was also directly approached by a dealer at another club, Westway, who tried to sell him krokodil and &apos;clean syringes&apos; in the bathroom.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Ramirez believes the novelty of the drug may tempt some to try it out once, but warns it&apos;s &quot;super addictive.&quot; So if for some reason you are procuring <em>any</em> drugs that require a syringe, think extra hard about it now, because you may end up like this: </p>

<p>Krokodil is made from codeine, iodine and red phosphorus (gasoline, paint thinner, alcohol) through a fairly simple process that yields an opioid &quot;contaminated with various toxic and corrosive byproducts.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160416155427/http://imgur.com/a/WKEXp">Here are some images</a> showing Krokodil being made, injected, and the horrifying results of being addicted to the drug&#x2014;and these aren&apos;t even the most graphic photos showing the reality&#x2014;for those, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160416155427/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/search?q=krokodil">click here</a> and here.</p>
