<p>This morning Governor Cuomo announced that $6.2 million in grant awards would be distributed among 16 historically significant properties, all of which still need repair after suffering severe damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. This is the second round of funding put towards rehabilitating historic landmarks; last year $5 million was put toward 14 different sites. </p>

<p>In New York City, the sites include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828120733/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/15/fraunces_tavern.php">Fraunces Tavern</a> in Manhattan; The Evergreens and Green-Wood Cemeteries, Lehigh Valley Barge No. 79 and Lookout Hill in Brooklyn; and the Basketmaker&#x2019;s House and Louis A. and Laura Stirn House on Staten Island. </p>

<p>A full list of properties getting some TLC are below. This program is funded by the National Park Service and administered by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Here are the details from the official announcement:</p>

The Evergreens Cemetery Preservation Foundation will also receive a $320,000 grant to commission a cultural landscape report to assess damage to the landscape, and provide short-term and long-term treatment plans. In addition to the 800 burials taking place at the cemetery every year, it also serves as a place where visitors can take stroll or jog enjoying nature in a surrounding urban environment in Brooklyn.</p>

Lookout Hill, a centerpiece in the Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux designed 1870 Prospect Park in Brooklyn, lost approximately 500 trees and suffered severe damage to the wooded slopes of Lookout Hill.
