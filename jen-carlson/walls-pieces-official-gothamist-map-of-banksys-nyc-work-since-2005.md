<p>The city is gripped by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101852/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> Mania, with the mysterious street artist putting up a new piece every day this month in different parts of the city&#x2014;it&apos;s a scavenger hunt for us, but for him it&apos;s somewhat of a return to his roots as an artist. </p>

<p>He told the Village Voice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101852/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/things_we_learned_from_the_banksy_i.php">in a rare interview</a> given over email: &quot;I started painting on the street because it was the only venue that would give me a show. Now I have to keep painting on the street to prove to myself it wasn&apos;t a cynical plan... commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist. When you look at how society rewards so many of the wrong people, it&apos;s hard not to view financial reimbursement as a badge of self-serving mediocrity.&quot; So once again, Banksy has taken to the streets of New York City, where he says every street artist wants to prove themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn&apos;t his first stab at the city&apos;s walls, he&apos;s been here time and again since 2005 (maybe even before?), and he&apos;s come in different forms. The multimillionaire art star has brought his clever stencils to our walls, he&apos;s put up large murals on our buildings, and he&apos;s even set up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101852/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/09/banksys_village_pet_store.php">a fake pet store</a> in a storefront. </p>

<p>For a look at the comprehensive set of Banksy&apos;s works in New York over the past decade, here&apos;s an interactive map, created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101852/http://www.twitter.com/smelendez">Steven Melendez</a> for Gothamist, below.</p>

<p>And spectators aren&apos;t the only ones drawn to his work&#x2014;other street artists and taggers have taken on plenty of his pieces, most commonly these come from Smart Crew (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101852/http://instagram.com/p/fRNuk8DbPS/">here&apos;s their latest addition</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101852/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/new_dramatic_banksy_piece_goes_up_o.php">his LES piece</a>)&#x2014;their &quot;contributions&quot; are highlighted in green in the map.</p>
