<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/http://pagesix.com/2013/12/04/keri-russell-stops-burglars-in-nyc-home">the NY Post</a> ran a story with the deceiving headline: &quot;Keri Russell stops burglars in NYC home,&quot; which they touted as a big &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/https://twitter.com/JessicaSimeone/status/408255111782076416">scoop</a>.&quot; The article lacked any action elements featuring the former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/revisiting_felicity_now_on_netflix.php"><em>Felicity</em></a> star roundhouse kicking a fumbling duo of home invaders, and the tabloid ended up amending their headline to: &quot;Home invasion at Keri Russell&#x2019;s brownstone.&quot; </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Amended: Keri Russell&apos;s townhouse burglarized while she&apos;s asleep, father/son crime team arrested. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/http://t.co/1cuSc1dScf">http://t.co/1cuSc1dScf</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/https://twitter.com/nypost">@nypost</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NYPD&amp;src=hash">#NYPD</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NYC&amp;src=hash">#NYC</a></p>&#x2014; JessicaSimeone (@JessicaSimeone) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/https://twitter.com/JessicaSimeone/statuses/408260064487550976">December 4, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>In reality, Russell was sleeping in her basement-level bedroom when the burglary occurred, and she never encountered the thieves, who entered through an open window upstairs. The items that were lifted have since been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/keri-russell-brooklyn-home-broken-cops-article-1.1537175">returned to her</a>... personally, by the NYPD, while she was on set of her show <em>The Americans</em>. So, same treatment the rest of us would get. </p>

<p>Sure, this burglary could have been prevented by simply locking up the windows, but former MTA head and mayoral hopeful Joe Lhota was quick to point out that he predicted this inevitable crime wave under a mayor de Blasio. Lhota, who lives in the neighborhood, passed by reporters on the scene last night and quipped, &#x201C;I told you guys this was gonna happen.&quot; </p>

<p>Russell has been living on Hicks Street in Brooklyn Heights with her son and her husband [UPDATE: Russell and her husband have separated, which is why she was alone, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20763228,00.html">People has learned</a>], while their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102423/http://www.elledecor.com/celebrity-style/homes/keri-russell-home">Boerum Hill home</a> gets renovated.</p>
