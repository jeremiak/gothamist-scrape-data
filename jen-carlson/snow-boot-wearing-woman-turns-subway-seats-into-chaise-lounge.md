<p>There&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071422/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/photos_the_snow_is_here_again_forev.php">a lot of snow</a> out there, you just walked all the way through it to get on the goddamn subway so you could go to your thankless job. Later, when you return home, it&apos;s going to be just as bad if not worse. Next week we&apos;ll probably have four more of these. Everyone feels your pain, lady. But we can get through this thing together if we just act like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071422/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">considerate human beings</a>. For starters, don&apos;t get on a rush hour subway and kick back in your snow boots like the entire bench is your own personal chaise lounge. Your back may be turned against your fellow straphangers&#x2014;as you wistfully gaze out the window and gossip with your girlfriend on the phone&#x2014;but their eyes are burning daggers through it.</p>

<p>Will Parker sent us this photo, taken on the Manhattan-bound M train at 9:30 a.m.&#x2014;he tells us it was &quot;crowded-ish, and people getting on after the Myrtle Ave stop had no seat.&quot; He was, however, unable to explain how this woman&apos;s boots had no sign of having walked through any snow.</p>
