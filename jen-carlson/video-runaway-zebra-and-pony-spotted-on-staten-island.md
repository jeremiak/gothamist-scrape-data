										<p>A zebra was spotted chasing a pony on the streets of Staten Island this morning, and thankfully the adorable action was all caught on film:</p>

<p>Not much is known about the animal escapees, but according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908011443/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/escaped_zebra_pony_take_store.html">to SILive</a>, the two were seen running through a shopping center parking lot and then down Victory Boulevard. The man who spotted the runaway duo and took the above footage says: &quot;30 seconds later, I saw two men in dark black suits carrying lassos running across the street. I have no idea how it got there... I figured [the men with lassos] knew what to do.&quot; Who were these mysterious men? Why were the animals running loose on the streets? Why was the zebra <em>chasing</em> the pony? This story has more questions than answers, so if you have any hot leads, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908011443/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">please let us know</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The police reported that the pair were captured and returned home to a petting zoo at Victory Boulevard and Travis Avenue. They also noted that the pony IS A HORSE!
