<p>Adding to the mix of venues and restaurants in the neighborhood, a new (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722003246/http://therisingtidenyc.com/post/202083422/photos-of-the-rising-tide">gorgeous</a>) space combining space focused on food has opened in Williamsburg. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722003246/http://therisingtidenyc.com/">The Rising Tide</a> is a new culinary and events loft that was built over the summer and is now open to the public. This is the same space that will soon be seen on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722003246/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008448.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1">IFC&apos;s Dinner with the Band</a> (starring chef Sam Mason). &quot;The Rising Tide is a unique production and events studio, located in a two story loft in Brooklyn.&quot; Measuring in at twelve-hundred square feet, if you aren&apos;t looking to film a show (because, you probably aren&apos;t), it can even host dinner parties for up to forty people.</p>

<p>If alcohol and food trucks are more your thing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722003246/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2009/10/new_venue_repor.php">the Village Voice</a> reports back from The Woods (brought to you by the owner of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722003246/http://www.yelp.com/biz/savalas-bar-and-lounge-brooklyn">Savalas</a>); it just opened up in the neighborhood (48 South 4th Street), following a year of construction and red tape. The bar has no sign, so keep your eyes peeled; once inside, it boasts &quot;a long bar with plenty of space, some casual lounge-type seating, a small stage and DJ setup, and a huge backyard lit by strings of bulbs. Most impressive is the Metropolitan Ave. taco truck they managed to relocate out back to serve up $2 tacos.&quot;</p>
