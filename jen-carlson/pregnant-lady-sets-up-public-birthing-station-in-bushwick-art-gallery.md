<p>You know things are going to get interesting when performance artists get pregnant. Enter: Marni Kotak, who is making Bushwick&apos;s Microscope Gallery her very own maternity ward... and you&apos;re invited. Kotak is ready to deliver her spawn sometime over the next six weeks, and starting tomorrow will be on display to all, eventually giving birth in front of a live audience. You can read more about the project, called the Birth of Baby X, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140514055428/http://www.microscopegallery.com/?page_id=1978">right here</a> (and on the chance you&apos;re left craving more, the Village Voice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140514055428/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/marni_kotak_gives_birth.php#more">recently interviewed</a> the artist.)</p>

<p>Over the next month, Kotak &quot;will often be present in the gallery preparing mentally and physically for the event, which will be assisted by a mid-wife and doula. The exhibit also includes videos of related performances... Remnants from the final days of pregnancy and the birth will be added to the exhibition as it progresses.&quot;</p>

<p>We urge you to go, and donate money for this child&apos;s future therapy.</p>
