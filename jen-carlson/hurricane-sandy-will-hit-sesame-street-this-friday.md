<p>In the wake of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121151925/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, PBS will be re-running Sesame Street&apos;s 2001, five-part <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121151925/http://sesamestreet.org/hurricane">hurricane special</a>. While the special has run before&#x2014;both in 2001 and right after Katrina in 2005&#x2014;this will be the first time it will air after a devastating hurricane hit Sesame Street&apos;s front yard directly. </p>

<p>In the episode, Big Bird&apos;s nest is destroyed, but the neighborhood comes together to help out. Sesame&apos;s supervising producer Nadine Zylstra <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121151925/http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/11/07/sesame-street-hurricane-special/">told EW</a>, the special tells the story &quot;of everybody on the street getting ready for a hurricane, and then ultimately recovering from a hurricane.&quot; The latest airing will include a few edits, as well (though sadly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121151925/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/phish_frontman_trey_anastasio_hands.php#photo-1">no Trey cameo</a>): &#x201C;For this latest airing, the show&#x2019;s team excised the portion about hurricane preparation and edited the hour so that it focuses on Big Bird&#x2019;s loss&#x2014;his nest is ruined, and after it&#x2019;s been repaired, he returns home only to find that the nest still isn&#x2019;t safe for habitation. (A city nest inspector tells Big Bird that its mud isn&#x2019;t dry yet.)&quot; But will there be a nutritional segment on how to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121151925/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/08/did_sandy_make_you_gain_weight.php">eat healthy</a> during a storm?</p>

<p>The show&apos;s edits and new additions were put together while Sesame employees were dealing with Hurricane Sandy-related obstacles of their own&#x2014;even the show&apos;s tapes were stranded in storage in LIC.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121151925/http://www.pbs.org/tv_schedules/">local listings</a> the show will air Friday at 7 a.m.</p>
