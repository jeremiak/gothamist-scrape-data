<p>Toronto street artist, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052315/http://www.bladediary.com/">Posterchild</a>, sent us the above photo of a piece he recently installed with the help of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052315/http://jasoneppink.com/pixelator">Jason Eppink</a> (he of the Pixelator). He&apos;ll be installing three more (&quot;tonight or soon!&quot;), which will say &quot;Fast,&quot; &quot;Sell&quot; and &quot;Out&quot;. (The pictured one may look like it says &quot;Bold&quot; but it actually says &quot;Hold.&quot;) No word on whether or not they&apos;ll be in the vicinity of the 14th and 8th station. </p>

<p>If you aren&apos;t familiar with the Pixelator, it&apos;s &quot;an unauthorized on-going video art performance collaboration with the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority, Clear Channel Communications, and its selected artists.&quot; In other words, it turns the ads, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052315/http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15156/">cost an estimated $274,000</a> for six ten-second spots every minute on each of the city&#x2019;s 80 digital displays, into art. Slightly more advanced than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052315/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/21/subway_ad_mashu.php">subway ad mash-ups</a>. </p>
