To clear things up on how the company works, and why they do what they do, we asked the senior vice president of licensing and the director of general licensing some questions.</em></p>

<p><strong>How do you find out if bars/clubs/restaurants/venues are playing ASCAP bands without a license?</strong><br>
First we know which establishments are licensed. ASCAP does not have or represent bands. We represent over 8.5 million copyrighted musical compositions (songs). We send licensing representatives into establishments and they are able to make a determination if any of ASCAP&apos;s songs are likely to be performed.</p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost for a typical establishment in New York to buy a yearly ASCAP license?</strong><br>
It would depend on the size of the seating capacity or occupancy fire code of the club. In addition to how often music is used (number of nights per week) and if the music is being performed live or if it&apos;s recorded music being played (CDs, tapes, iPod, etc.) If there is a cover charge or cost of admission is also a consideration. In New York City an average annual fee would be approximately $1,000.00 or about $2.40 a day.</p>

<p><strong>What does an establishment get by purchasing a license?</strong><br>
The authorization to publicly perform any or all of the 8.5 million songs as many times as they wish.</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the typical outcome of a lawsuit like the current one against Hiro Ballroom?</strong><br>
If it goes to trial the typical outcome is that the plaintive wins and the defendant loses. However most lawsuits are settled before they go to trial.</p>

<p><strong>When you&apos;re out on a non-business related night and hear an ASCAP band being played - do you inquire about a license?</strong><br>
No. We will in most cases just check our licensed database when we return to work.</p>
