title: Let These Slow Subway GIFs Ease You Through Old NYC

										<p>Slow Television is a wonderful creation that was popularized by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) in the aughts, and therefore sometimes referred to as Norwegian Slow Television. The genre aims for a sort of Zen viewing experience, by offering essentially hours and hours of footage documenting an ordinary event via a single shot. For example, NRK kicked off their foray into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151742/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television">slow TV</a> with a broadcast of a 7-hour train ride, all shot from one point-of-view, unedited.</p>

<p>Some look to Andy Warhol as the creator of slow TV, with the release of his 1963 film <em>Sleep</em> (literally over 5 hours of footage showing poet John Giorno sleeping). But that was not exactly the same thing&#x2014;and it was far less soothing than traveling through a European countryside via a camera mounted to the front of a train car. And it was far less hygge than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151742/http://gothamist.com/tags/yulelog">the Yule log</a>, another slow TV hit.</p>

<p>But before slow TV had a name, others were already filming ordinary events from one point-of-view&#x2014;particularly on trains (hands down the breakout star of slow television). Below, we have created Slow GIFs from some early footage taken on subway cars. A calming dose of slow TV in a much shorter package, to accommodate shorter contemporary attention spans. These were all shot in NYC&apos;s subway system, from 1905 through the 1980s&#x2014;let&apos;s call them New York Slow GIFs.</p>

<p>And finally, taken from 1980s footage from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151742/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevensiegel">the great Steven Siegel</a>, a much faster, fear-fueled foray into Slow GIFs. <em>Wait for it...</em></p>
