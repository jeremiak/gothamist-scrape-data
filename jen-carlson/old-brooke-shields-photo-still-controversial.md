The nude photograph of the actress at age 10 was to be part of a new salacious exhibit, which of course was met by the sighs of both children&apos;s advocates and religious groups, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007065836/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2009/09/30/2009-09-30_photo_of_nude_10yearold_brooke_shields_spiritual_americana_part_of_tate_modern_p.html">the Daily News</a>. One outraged critic told them, &quot;Putting a sign on the door like that means every pedophile in the land will head straight to that room.&quot; The Man agreed, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007065836/http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/sep/30/brooke-shields-naked-tate-modern">it&apos;s being reported</a> that officers from the obscene publications unit of the Metropolitan police have taken it down. The photograph hung in the Guggenheim just two years ago, and features a &quot;nude ten-year-old Brooke Shields, heavily made-up, standing in a bath.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007065836/http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/blogon/art_news/controversies_at_musee_de_lelysee_lausanne/4397">It actually is rather disturbing</a>.</p>
