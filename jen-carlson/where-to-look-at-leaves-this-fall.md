<span class="photo_caption">Central Park (photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://www.flickr.com/photos/circularruins/4107577590/">circular ruins&apos; flickr</a>)</span></p>

<p>When we last checked in on the fall foliage reports it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/29/fall_foliage_is_coming_our_way.php">late September</a>, when everything was still in the green. But now that the leaves have started to die their colorful deaths, it&apos;s time to check in again. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://www.weather.com/maps/activity/fallfoliage/northeastusfallfoliage_large.html">Weather.com</a>&apos;s map, we are seeing &quot;patchy&quot; colors right now, but the orange &quot;mid peak&quot; color band is getting very close to New York City on their map. And over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://iloveny.com/What-To-Do/Reasons-To-Love-NY/Fall-Foliage-Report.aspx">I Love NY</a>&apos;s site, they have us down for &quot;just changing.&quot; So, where can leaf peepers spot some color:</p>

<p><strong>Central Park:</strong> They&apos;ve got all types of trees over there, and they&apos;re just bursting with beautiful dead leaves. If you head over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/great-lawn/belvedere-castle.html">to Belvedere Castle</a>, you can even get a nice panoramic view of the park.</p>

<p><strong>On a boat:</strong> Did you know you can soak in some Autumn hues on the Water Taxi? They&apos;re hosting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://www.nywatertaxi.com/tours/fall-foliage">Fall Foliage Cruises</a> starting on October 23rd (and every Sunday through November 6th). Departing from South Street Seaport, they&apos;re offering &quot;autumn day trips north up through the serene Lower Hudson River Valley... Sail by numerous famous historic sights and landmarks, such as Grant&#x2019;s Tomb, The Little Red Lighthouse, Bear Mountain Bridge, Sleepy Hollow and George Washington Bridge, all set against fall colors as diverse as the people of New York.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Prospect Park:</strong> From the sugar maples around the lake, to the ravine trails between the Nethermead and the Long Meadow, there are leaves a plenty to peep in this park. </p>

<p><strong>Riverside Park:</strong> Leaves <em>and</em> the Hudson! What more could you ask for? The park spans from 58th to 158th Streets (and Riverside Drive), but we hear the area around the low 100s is especially leafy.</p>

<p><strong>Fort Tyron Park:</strong> Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/forttryonpark">uptown offering</a>, and this one&apos;s even got the Cloisters. Also, dog owners will find a nice dog run &quot;complete with a gazebo for dog owners to sit and socialize.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Brooklyn and the New York Botanical Gardens:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://www.nybg.org/">In the Bronx</a>, they&apos;ve got a foliage tracker online so you can pick the best time to visit their autumnal offerings. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031228/http://www.bbg.org/photos/fall_foliage">here&apos;s a look</a> at what Brooklyn will be looking like soon.</p>

<p>Where else can a New Yorker take in some nature this Fall?</p>
