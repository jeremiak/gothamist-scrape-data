</div></div>					<p>Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s condo-hotel complex&#x2014;called Pierhouse and 1Hotels, respectively&#x2014;won&apos;t be open for a while, but a few renderings have surfaced for the latter. The hotel side of the complex (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130645/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/28/brooklyn_bridge_park_condos.php">controversially built on Brooklyn Bridge Park</a> ground), will open first, sometime in 2016 (the condos in 2017). </p>

<p>The buildings are still going up, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130645/http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2015/7/5/1397/24625/hotels/This_Month_Central_Park%2C_Next_Year_Brooklyn_Bridge_Park_for_1_Hotels">HotelChatter</a> discovered renderings of what&apos;s to come on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130645/http://1hotels.com/en/brooklyn_bridge_park">the hotel&apos;s website</a>, which calls it: &quot;A natural refuge, our beacon to nature, right on Brooklyn&#x2019;s waterfront.&quot; You know what else was a natural refuge? The parkland this luxury hotel now looms over.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s more from the site:</p>

<blockquote>To us, nature is the original Old Master. We look at lush greenery, vivid flowers and sumptuous woodgrain&#x2014;and see artwork more exquisite than anything that adorns museum walls. We design with each hotel&apos;s natural setting as inspiration, structuring spaces with seamless transitions from outdoors to indoors&#x2014;complete with lots of light and little enclaves to retreat, enjoy and admire.</blockquote>

<p>Topping it all off will be The Roof at 1, a rooftop bar and lounge, &quot;where guests can sit in rocking chairs while sipping a cocktail or snuggle up beside our fire pits with a glass of wine.&quot; There will also be a 10th floor lounge, a screening room, a ballroom, and food from restaurateur Seamus Mullen.
