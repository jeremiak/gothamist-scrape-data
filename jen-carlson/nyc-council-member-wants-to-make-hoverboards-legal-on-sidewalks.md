<p>Earlier this week we revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221450/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/mcfly_and_get_fined.php">that &quot;hoverboards&quot; are illegal in NYC</a> under NY State Law, which declares them to be motor vehicles that cannot be registered. This means you can own a &quot;hoverboard,&quot; but you cannot operate it. </p>

<p>There&apos;s a definite gray area here, since this is new technology and the NYPD may not be actively enforcing a law that makes them illegal to operate. In fact, in the below video, shot earlier this week, you&apos;ll see an NYPD officer declare that they are legal. So now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221450/https://twitter.com/AndyKingNYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Councilman Andy King</a> is proposing a bill that would regulate them even further and clarify when/where/if they can be operated in NYC.</p>

<p>The councilman&apos;s press office sent out a release regarding the proposed legislation, which would ban &quot;hoverboards&quot; from NYC streets... even though they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221450/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/hoverboard_overboard.php">technically already are banned</a>. &quot;The recent spike in popularity of these devices, coupled with the growing safety concerns, creates a regulatory grey area that should be addressed swiftly,&quot; King said. &#x201C;The hover boards should have the same status as mobile chairs and should not be operated on the roads alongside cars, buses and trucks. It&#x2019;s a safety issue.&quot;</p>

<p>King says his proposal, which is still being drafted, would allow &quot;hoverboards&quot; on sidewalks, and in parks and playgrounds, but would ban them from the roadway and bike lanes&#x2014;&quot;I want to clear up any questions where you can use them. You can use them on sidewalks, in the playground, but not in the bike lane, not in the street&quot; (according to his proposal; currently they are illegal on the sidewalks and in parks). They should be viewed as a recreational novelty, King believes, not as a mode of transportation.</p>

<p>King also points out that long-term use of hover boards doesn&#x2019;t promote a healthy lifestyle: &#x201C;Riding a hover board decreases physical activity. In the long run, walking is more beneficial for your heart and lungs than riding a hover board all day.&quot; To illustrate this point, King suggested we rewatch <em>Wall-E</em>, where humanity relocated to a spaceship and everyone became obese after relying on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221450/http://disneyinfinitycodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/6a00d8341bf67c53ef011570005455970c.jpg">hoverchairs</a> as a mode of transportation.</p>
