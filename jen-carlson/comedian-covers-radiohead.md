										<p><img alt="2007_07_arts_okstereogum.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_07_arts_okstereogum.jpg" width="225" height="225" class="right">Stereogum has raised the bar with their latest endeavor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://www.stereogum.com/okx/">a tribute to Radiohead&apos;s <em>OK Computer</em></a> on the album&apos;s 10th anniversary. Musicians from all over have contributed, some of the New York bands you may recognize: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://www.myspace.com/vampireweekend">Vampire Weekend</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://www.myspace.com/mybrightestdiamond">My Brightest Diamond</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://www.myspace.com/doveman">Doveman</a> and...who&apos;s this Samson Dalonoga? </p>

<p>We think this guy sounds suspiciously like a character David Cross has been known to take on. We&apos;re certain we&apos;ve heard this voice on a stage downtown at some point. What do you think? (Listen to the tracks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://www.stereogum.com/okx/">here</a>.) Either way, we&apos;re happy they didn&apos;t ask <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/21/its_been_a_whil.php">comedian/singer/songwriter John Mayer</a> to contribute. </p>

<p>Hopefully we&apos;ll get the real Radiohead in town again soon - the band was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/16/radioheads_new.php">in New York</a> last June <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/14/radiohead_live.php">for some smaller shows</a>. Since then they&apos;ve been working on (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072736/http://radiohead.com/deadairspace/">and blogging about working on</a>) a new album, but for now - other bands covering their music will have to tide over the masses.  </p>
