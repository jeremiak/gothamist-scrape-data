However, author Candace Bushnell has just released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706081131/http://www.amazon.com/Summer-City-Carrie-Diaries-Novel/dp/0061728934">her latest young adult novel</a>, which follows a teenage Carrie Bradshaw from Connecticut<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706081131/http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2011-04-26-bushnellrev_ST_N.htm"> to the city</a>, where she meets Samantha, then Miranda, goes vintage clothes shopping, visits the Shubert Theatre, at one point throws her arms open and shouts: &quot;Hello, New York!&quot; <em>And so on.</em> After a visit to Saks she&apos;s basically an expert on the city.... so her guide to the <em>real</em> New York has been included in the book. At least she&apos;s teaching people how to pronounce Houston Street?</p>
