</div></div>					<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414131744/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/east_river_2.php">we posted a graphic photo</a> of a bloated animal near the East River, and assumed it was just one of the many giant mutant rats in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414131744/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/giant_rat.php">Giant Mutant Urban Rat Army</a> that is planning a takeover of human New Yorkers. But don&apos;t ya know it turns out there may not actually be a Giant Mutant Urban Rat Army taking over the city? At least, no one has sent out the activation call yet, which happens when you look into a dirty sidewalk puddle at the strike of noon and say R.O.U.S. three times aloud without blinking (if you did that, please send us an email at homelandsecurity@gothamist.gov). <em>So</em>, what is this thing? There has been much debate about it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414131744/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_the_Shark">for some reason</a>. </p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414131744/http://www.animalnewyork.com/2012/strange-creature-spotted-near-the-east-river-was-not-a-monster/">Animal</a> says the Parks Department told them, &#x201C;It was a pig left over from a cookout,&quot; Vickie Karp at the Parks Department told us this morning, &quot;We did not say this,&quot; adding, &quot;We said it was a cooked pig and we disposed of it.&quot; Parks, however, did not have an animal expert on location to make that call, so we turned to Cornell University&apos;s naturalist professor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414131744/http://dnr.cornell.edu/cals/dnr/people/faculty.cfm?netId=pdc1">Paul Curtis</a>.</p>

<p>After looking at all of the above photos, Curtis told us this morning, &quot;The best guess looking at body conformation and dentition, is <strong>this was likely a small dog that drowned and has been floating in the river for quite a while.  It is obviously bloated, and all the hair has slipped off the carcass.</strong> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414131744/http://gothamist.com/tags/montaukmonster">Montauk monster</a> that washed up on LI... that was determined to be a bloated raccoon carcass.  The teeth in this case look more dog-like than raccoon-like to me.  It&#x2019;s tough to confirm the species from the photos without the jaw in hand to examine the teeth in detail.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414131744/http://gawker.com/5928990/east-river-hell-pig-monster-now-idd-as-dog-but-river-monsters-jeremy-wade-still-skeptical">Gawker</a> has now asked Animal Planet&apos;s Jeremy Wade to help identify the creature, and he also confirms it&apos;s not a pig.</p>
