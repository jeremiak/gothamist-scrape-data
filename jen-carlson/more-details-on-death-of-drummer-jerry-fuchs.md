										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpL9DUwwPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164618im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpL9DUwwPM.jpg" width="350" height="262" class="image-left"> </span>Early Sunday morning Brooklyn musician Jerry Fuchs died after falling down an elevator shaft at 338 Berry Street in Williamsburg. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164618/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/08/wburg_party.php">we mentioned yesterday</a>, Fuchs was attending a benefit party there thrown by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164618/http://www.theuniformproject.com/">the Uniform Project</a>, and it was around 12:30 a.m. that the manual freight elevator in the converted loft building became stuck between the 4th and 5th floors. A friend jumped off to safety, but when Fuchs followed his clothing became stuck and he fell down the shaft.</p>

<p>Fuchs&apos;s roommate, from the band Holy Ghost!, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164618/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/nyregion/09elevator.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> that when he looked into the shaft he saw someone lying face down, adding, &#x201C;We flipped him over and it was Jerry. When we found him he was not able to talk.&#x201D; He wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164618/http://holyghostnyc.blogspot.com/2009/11/thank-you-jerry.html">on the band&apos;s blog</a>: &quot;We held him and talked to him and went with him to Belvue hospital. Unfortunately, the doctors were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at 3:33 am.&quot; He goes on to post their last text exchange from that night, noting that Fuchs was &quot;relentlessly polite in a world in which manners have largely been replaced by irony and sarcasm.&quot;</p>

<p>Fuchs was a Williamsburg resident, and was known by many for his talent as a drummer; James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem told the Times that &#x201C;He was one of the only people we all knew who was literally great at what he did. And he was incredibly generous with his talent.&#x201D; Indeed, Fuchs was in many bands throughout his 34 years, including !!!, Turing Machine, The Juan Maclean, and most recently Maserati.</p>

<p>The Department of Buildings is investigating... but a quick look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164618/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=3&amp;houseno=338&amp;street=berry+st&amp;requestid=0&amp;s=A03C41B885B461E4F46BD08866A7430E">the property overview</a> shows plenty of violations, including 10 elevator violations, the most recent from October 30th. We&apos;ve contacted the DoB to clarify what these past violations mean, and why they were &quot;dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164618/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/11/08/2009-11-08_man_dies_after_plummeting_down_freight_elevator_shaft_.html">the Daily News</a> reports that there was an elevator operator, but when Fuchs arrived, he was nowhere in sight. A friend at the party who received a phone call from Fuchs when the elevator got stuck, says, &quot;Jerry had no idea that there was supposed to be an operator.&quot;</p>
