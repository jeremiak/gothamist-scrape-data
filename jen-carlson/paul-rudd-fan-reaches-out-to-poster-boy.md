<p>Is an unlikely bromance in the air? Has Paul Rudd reached out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140505/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/posterboy_street_artist.php">Poster Boy</a> with specifics about how he wants the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140505/http://www.iloveyouman.com/"><em>I Love You, Man</em></a> ad campaign altered? This letter was spotted on the downtown 6 platform at 51st Street. The actor does like to take on fake names (at a recent Virgin Megastore appearance he went under &quot;Fred Rudd&quot;), so giving himself a musical moniker of &quot;Raul&quot; does fit his M.O. However, this is probably just the work of a crazy Rudd fan, or some sort of plan by Dreamworks to enliven  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140505/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/i_love_you_man.jpg">their boring posters</a>.</p>
