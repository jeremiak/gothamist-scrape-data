<p>Starting just before the drab, colorless winter months, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152035/http://momaps1.org/">MoMA PS1</a> will hang some color in its halls. The museum is hosting the largest exhibition of Mike Kelley&apos;s work <em>to date</em> starting October 13th (and running through February 2nd). </p>

<p>Kelley&#x2014;who committed suicide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152035/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324678604578340322829104276.html">last year</a>&#x2014;is regarded as &quot;one of the most influential artists of our time [having] produced a body of deeply innovative work mining American popular culture and both modernist and alternative traditions&#x2014;which he set in relation to relentless self- and social examinations, both dark and delirious.&quot; The exhibition will feature 200 works, including early pieces from the 1970s, which will be displayed throughout the entire museum. This is the first time in 25 years that MoMA PS1 has been dedicated that kind of space to a single artist.</p>

<p>These images are of &quot;Deodorized Central Mass with Satellites (1991/1999),&quot; and feature plush toys sewn over wood and wire frames with styrofoam packing material, nylon rope, pulleys, steel hardware and hanging plates, fiberglass, car paint, and disinfectant. Like a Care Bears explosion.</p>
