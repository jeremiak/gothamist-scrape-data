<p>Warning: It&apos;s very, very dusty in here.</p>

<p>Earlier this year an abandoned mastiff pup named Jesse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183438/http://thisdogslife.co/a-mastiff-found-abandoned-in-new-york-city-woods-takes-first-steps-5-26-2015/">was found</a> in a park in Harlem. She was injured (it is unclear how) and couldn&apos;t walk on her own, but her rescuers&#x2014;the non-profit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183438/http://www.nybullycrew.org/">New York Bully Crew</a>&#x2014;were determined to help. They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183438/http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/help-us-with-jesse-s-extended-care-rehab-and-therapy-/346267">raised money</a> for her rehab, and documented her progress&#x2014;from crawling, to using some wheels:</p>

<p>Man, *sniff*, allergy season IS really bad this year.</p>

<p>But now there&apos;s good news: Jesse has come a long way since she was found crawling alone in a park in Harlem&#x2014;the organization recently released this video via Instagram, showing her walk on her own! They wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183438/https://www.facebook.com/crewnewyorkbully/videos/vb.188532397825828/997060080306385/?type=2&amp;theater">on Facebook</a>, &quot;One week ago today, Jesse stood on all fours with no help. During this past week she took her first step. Today, she is walking! I knew she would... Next is running with my pack... This is truly what I live for and feel blessed to have been able to help her through this... And please don&apos;t be sad she fell at the end.. We all as babies have been there.&quot;</p>

<p>Jesse is not (yet?) up for adoption, but you can adopt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183438/http://www.nybullycrew.org/female-dogs.html">any of these lovely ladies</a> the organization has listed. We&apos;re gonna go watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183438/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO9d2PpP7tQ">that Sarah McLachlan SPCA commercial</a> now.
