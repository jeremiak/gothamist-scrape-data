</div></div><p>Nothing beats a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183251/http://simpsons.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Kids_Newz">Bart&apos;s People</a> story, right? On October 28th, New York&apos;s Bravest saved this adorable cat from an evil barb wire fence in Queens. The FDNY&apos;s Frank Dwyer tells us that Friday at 3 p.m., the FDNY members from Ladder 138 in Queens were notified of the stuck animal, who was on top of the fence at National Street and 43rd Avenue. Dwyer says, &quot;Firefighters used the tower ladder bucket to reach the cat, and removed the cat from the wires in a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>The cat was briefly taken back to the firehouse, where it was treated for an injured tail and paw, and then the ASPCA came to pick it up. We reached out to the ASPCA yesterday, but they&apos;ve not been able to track the cat down in their system yet.</p>
