                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smsupercutz0713.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173321im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smsupercutz0713.jpg" width="325" height="266" class="image-right"> </span>Recently we were mesmerized by a 17-minute long superclip of the New York City subway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173321/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/video_17-minute_superclip_of_the_19.php">in the 1970s and &apos;80s</a>, and now the man who made that&#x2014;Jonathan Hertzberg&#x2014;is back with more decades old gritty city scenes. This time he takes the action above ground, delivering over one hour of footage &quot;from the Lindsay years through the first two Koch terms.&quot; Hertzberg also explained his process of cutting the clips together:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;All shots are connected by at least one of the following: location, film, character, actor, signage, recurring object, or recurring motif.  Try and see how many of these connections you can spot and how many films you can identify.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Below are the first three parts of what Hertzberg calls &quot;Dirty Old New York aka Fun City,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173321/http://knifeinthehead.blogspot.com/2013/06/dirty-old-new-york-aka-fun-city.html">he promises</a> more to come&#x2014;&quot;As it turns out, there will be a Part IV, which is already about halfway done.  Perhaps that will be a good place to stop.&quot;</p>
