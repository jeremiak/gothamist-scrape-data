<p>Henry Ward Beecher&apos;s frisky spirit is still lurking around Brooklyn Heights&#x2014;according to some, he&apos;s haunting Plymouth Church, where he was the first pastor, starting in 1847. Beecher was a good guy, known for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/henry-w-beecher-spoke-against-slavery">his support</a> of the abolition of slavery, so you probably don&apos;t need to fear his ghost... however, in the 1870s he found himself in the center of a scandal. Beecher was the subject of a famous adultery trial, after allegedly having an affair with his friend Theodore Tilton&apos;s wife, Elizabeth (something she confessed to). Back in those days, one could sue for such a thing! And Theodore Tilton did just that.</p>

<p>For more on the backstory, here&apos;s Andrea Janes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/http://boroughsofthedead.com/">Boroughs of the Dead</a>:</p>

<p>One of the first documented sightings of Beecher&apos;s ghost was printed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody%27s_Magazine">Everybody&apos;s Magazine</a>, a Brooklyn publication that ran from 1899 to 1929&#x2014;it stated: &quot;The ghost of Henry Ward Beecher has appeared to a former friend, and confided himself in his message to complaining that a certain coin, known as &apos;the widow&apos;s mite,&apos; had not been returned to him.&quot; The ghost made no mention of a scandal.</p>

<p>This was one of the biggest sex scandals of its time, a famous &quot;he said, she said&quot; case that not only got plenty of ink at the time (here&apos;s one lengthy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9503E6D91438E63ABC4151DFBE66838F669FDE">NY Times article</a>), but has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/30/reviews/000130.30donaldt.html">the subject of books</a> since. </p>

<p>It all ended with a hung jury, and Beecher was exonerated, but he still had to deal with the court of public opinion, and a scandal tainting his legacy. Though it&apos;s worth noting that if Beecher&apos;s spirit <em>is</em> still lingering because of all this, it&apos;s lingering in close proximity to not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/http://www.brooklynvisualheritage.org/beecher-statue-plymouth-church-orange-street">one</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/columbus-park/monuments/102">but two</a> statues erected in tribute to him.</p>

<p>Janes runs her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303003427/http://boroughsofthedead.com/">Boroughs of the Dead</a> tours year round, in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens (with tours in the Bronx and Staten Island coming up soon).</p>
