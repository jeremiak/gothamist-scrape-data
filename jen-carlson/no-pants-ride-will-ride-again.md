<p>It&apos;s that time of year again... time to take those pants off, get on the crowded subway, and make some awkward straight-faced eye contact with the fully clothed straphangers. The No Pants Subway Ride returns <em>this</em> Sunday! If you want to take part in the 10th annual ride (hosted by Improv Everywhere), there will be six meet-up locations (get details on where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110323021634/http://improveverywhere.com/2011/01/02/no-pants-subway-ride-2011-details-for-new-york/">right here</a>)&#x2014;and if you want to <em>avoid</em> the event, we suggest being in your safe place by 3 p.m. on Sunday.</p>

<p>For spectators, send us your photos or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr&#x2014;and stay tuned for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110323021634/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/01/extreme_pranking_no_underwear_subwa.php">No Underwear Ride</a> later this year ;)</p>
