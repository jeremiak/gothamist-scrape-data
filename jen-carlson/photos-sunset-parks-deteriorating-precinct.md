</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s something eerie about a 19th century police station standing in ruins in Brooklyn. Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144425/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/">Nate Kensinger</a> recently took a look around the old precinct in Sunset Park, which has abandoned since the 1970s (it was called the &quot;68th Police Precinct Station House and Stable&quot; when up and running). The building originally opened its doors in 1892, and the NY Times called it &quot;castlelike.&quot; Upon his return, Kensinger reports back on the current state of things, saying, &quot;Its exterior still retains many evocative architectural elements, however the interior has been almost completely destroyed by fire and decay. Snow sifts through large holes in the roof. The upper floors have collapsed, while lower floors are missing, warped or dangerously unstable.&quot; </p>

<p>He also makes not of feral cats, pigeons, and evidence of squatters. Still, it was landmarked in 1983, three years after it was gutted by a fire&#x2014;and is currently on the Landmarks Conservancy list of &quot;at risk&quot; historic structures.
