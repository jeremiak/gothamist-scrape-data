<p>The Camden People&apos;s Theatre in London has put together a musical about the life and career of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225151806/http://gothamist.com/tags/beastieboys">the Beastie Boys</a>. The unauthorized musical biography is called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225151806/http://www.cptheatre.co.uk/show/liscence_to_ill.php#.Vip-dWSrSis">Licensed to Ill</a>,&quot; and is presented by Simon Maeder and Adam El Hagar (<em>Peaky Blinders</em>, <em>Tyrant</em>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225151806/http://pitchfork.com/news/61762-beastie-boys-musical-theater-production-licensed-to-ill-tells-story-of-their-career/">Pitchfork</a> reached out to the creators, who say they&apos;ve &quot;ensured the Beastie Boys are fully appraised of our plans for the show,&quot; but note the production is unauthorized. </p>

<p>Typically, the Beastie Boys are (rightfully) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225151806/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/20/beastie_boys_suing_monster_energy_d.php">not fans</a> of their name or work being used without permission. The group&apos;s publicist had no comment on the production.</p>

<p>The show, it appears, will go on anyway, from November 23rd through December 12th, and here&apos;s the description provided on the website:</p>

<blockquote>A brand new show about hip-hop&#x2019;s most notorious pranksters. Join three young New Yorkers - Mike D, MCA and Ad-Rock - as they go from teenage punks to international rapping legends: The Beastie Boys. Created with creative support from comedy hip-hop legends Abandonman and the Rubberbandits, and using a mix of live music and DJ-ing, Licensed to Ill travels through time from the hiphoppers of &apos;80s New York to the &apos;90s gangsters of LA - all the way to the total globalisation of hiphop. This loud, crazy show does to music theatre what hiphop did to tracksuits: make them cool.

<p>The Beastie Boys&apos; story sheds light on many issues still raising hackles: racism towards &amp; within rap; misogyny; the battle for hiphop&apos;s soul, between those using it for protest, &amp; for profit. We follow the gang from teenage punks, via their discovery by legendary producer Rick Rubin, to their induction into the Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Hall of Fame.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Sadly, creators missed a great naming opportunity here, but there&apos;s still time to change that! Some better titles: &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beasties,&quot; &quot;Ill Miserables,&quot; &quot;The King Ad Rock &amp; I,&quot; &quot;How To Succeed In Body Movin Without Really Trying,&quot; &quot;A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Paul&apos;s Boutique.&quot; We&apos;ll be here all week.</p>
