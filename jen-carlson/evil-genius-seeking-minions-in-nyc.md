<p>Someone has been hanging up these signs around New York City (this one was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005128/https://twitter.com/anthonylfisher/status/222440993012715520">spotted in LIC</a>) which signal the hatching of some downright evil plans. The poster is looking to form a team of minions for some unspecified dastardly deed. The sign announces:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Evil genius seeks minions to sacrifice their lives in world domination attempt. Must be prepared to work 24-7 for fascist psychopath for close to no pay. Messy death inevitable but costumes and laser death rays provided. NO Weirdos.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>There&apos;s a phone number included (1-800-MWA-HAHA) which we just called, and it goes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005128/http://www.puc.state.tx.us/industry/communications/directories/ilec/report_ilec.aspx?ID=ILSQL01DB1245201000011">Cap Rock Telephone Cooperative</a>, where a nice woman who answered asked if we were calling because of the &quot;Mwahaha sign.&quot; Shamed, we hung our head and apologized, as we inquired how many others had called her today&#x2014;she told us she&apos;s heard from over 500 hopeful minions in the past few hours (likely because the sign also got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005128/http://imgur.com/gallery/Rlf4K">posted on Reddit</a>). </p>

<p>Keep your heads up, prospective minions, there&apos;s bound to be another job that comes along... but please stop calling that number.</p>
