---

<p>As talks of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110323021255/http://gothamist.com/tags/walmart">Wal-Mart</a> moving into New York City become more intense, the people behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110323021255/http://www.nma.tv/walmart-threatens-york-city-merchants/">Taiwanese CGI videos</a> decided to give the story an over-the-top treatment. Below, watch as Wal-Mart bigwigs shoot fire at mom and pop shops (and presumably innocent pedestrians/potential customers!) from their Godzilla machine.</p>
