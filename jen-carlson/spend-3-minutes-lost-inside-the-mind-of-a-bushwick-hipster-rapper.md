	<p>Someone Tweeted this video at us because that is how the Youngs communicate these days. Please take 3 minutes and 39 seconds to watch the entire thing, because we have some questions:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143751if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvFFtcYg6lo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>First question: Are we only finding out about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143751/https://twitter.com/lifestream_org/status/331961470235574272">this guy</a> now but really he&apos;s already <em>so over</em> and we&apos;re late to the party? If the answer is &quot;yes&quot; just take our laptop and modem out back and do what you gotta do. No need to keep reading.</p>

<p>Still here? Phew. Okay, so is it ironic? Is it post-ironic? Are we too old and too square to get it? Is it trying to tell us something? Is this like who Hannah from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143751/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a> would befriend during a faux bad-ass hipst-hop phase? What&apos;s hipst-hop? Did we just invent that? &#x2122;! This is like exactly who you guys think of when you think of &quot;hipsters,&quot; right? Listen we don&apos;t want to use that word either, but this boy-man kind of seems to embody the collective definitions and ideas people have about hipsters, no? [Editor&apos;s note: find our previous coverage of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143751/http://gothamist.com/tags/hipster">hipsters here</a>.] Is this who will be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143751/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/inside_skinny_dennis_williamsburgs.php#photo-1">Skinny Dennis</a> if we ever make it over there like we want to? Is this like what Thought Catalog would look like as a video? </p>
