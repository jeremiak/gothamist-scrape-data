<p>Due to our love of music, arts and everything visual, audible and touchable...Gothamist attends many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521094524/http://www.gothamist.com/events/" target="_blank">events</a>. We go, we learn, we feel happy/sad/enlightened and we report back to you. Prior to all of this going down however, we like to pick some events we intend to go to in the future and do a quick background or overview of what it&apos;s all about. </p>

<p>So incase you haven&apos;t heard, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521094524/http://www.festivalproductions.net/jvc04/ny.htm" target="_blank">JVC Jazz Festival</a> is just around the corner. Gothamist hopes to attend a number of shows on the incredible lineup (featuring more than 300 artists/60 shows/17 venues). </p>

<p>The JVC Jazz Festival is celebrating some anniversaries this year. <b>George Wein</b>, the man to thank for the Newport Jazz Festival, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival amongst others says this of the landmark year:<br>
<i>&#xFFFD;The summer of 2004 is truly a producer&apos;s dream. In June, we celebrate the 20th year with JVC as a corporate sponsor and supporter of jazz,&#xFFFD; Wein announced. &#xFFFD;To cap it off, this August marks the 50th anniversary of the world&apos;s first jazz festival, the Newport Jazz Festival, sponsored by JVC. We are grateful to JVC for helping us bring the festival in to the 21st Century.&#xFFFD;</i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521094524/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/" target="_blank">All About Jazz</a>).</p>

<p>As for Gothamist, we&apos;ll be at the <b>Nina Simone</b> Tribute on Monday June 21st . And you can be sure we&apos;ll be at the <b>Lou Reed</b> show on Wednesday June 23rd and reporting back to you the next day on how we nearly fell off the balcony upon hearing our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521094524/http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/lou-reed/85235.html" target="_blank">favorite song</a>.
