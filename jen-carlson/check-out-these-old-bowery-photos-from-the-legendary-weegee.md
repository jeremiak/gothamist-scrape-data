					<p>Legendary (and self-taught) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090743/http://gothamist.com/tags/weegee">photographer WeeGee</a>, real name Arthur Fellig, has arguably taken some of the most beautiful, compelling, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090743/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/04/grisly_crime_scene_photos_from_1930.php#photo-1">disturbing photos</a> of NYC. </p>

<p>He began working as a photographer shortly after his parents moved to the city from the Ukraine, when he was just 14 years old. In 1918 he worked in a Lower Manhattan photography studio, then floated around newspapers for a bit, before officially becoming freelance news photographer in 1935. From his bio:</p>

<blockquote>He centered his practice around police headquarters and in 1938 obtained permission to install a police radio in his car. This allowed him to take the first and most sensational photographs of news events and offer them for sale to publications such as the Herald-Tribune, Daily News, Post, and PM Weekly, among others.</blockquote> 

<p>New York&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090743/http://www.icp.org/browse/archive/constituents/weegee?all/all/all/all/0">International Center of Photography</a> holds many of his photographs (around 20,000!), and they&apos;re bringing 39 of his Bowery prints to Jersey City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090743/http://www.icp.org/exhibitions/weegees-bowery?utm_source=ICP+News&amp;utm_campaign=b3c4d5badc-Press16_04.26_Weegee_s_Bowery_at_Mana&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4b79988be6-b3c4d5badc-16787533">for a new exhibit</a>. The photos capture a very different incarnation of The Bowery, as it existed in the 1940s and &apos;50s.</p>

<blockquote>Weegee&#x2019;s photographs show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090743/http://gothamist.com/tags/thebowery">the Bowery</a> when it was still New York&#x2019;s Skid Row. A  gathering point for derelicts and down-and-out transients who huddled in the shadow of the Third Avenue elevated railway, it was notorious for its fleabag hotels, flop houses that offered 25-cent-per-night beds, and crowded all-night missions that provided food and shelter to those who could afford neither. The exhibition includes an extensive selection of Weegee&#x2019;s photographs of a raucous nightclub and cabaret called Sammy&#x2019;s on the Bowery, located at 267 Bowery.</blockquote>

<p>The exhibit opens at Mana Contemporary (888 Newark Avenue, Jersey City) on May 1st, and will run through August 5th. Click through for a preview, as well as photos of the man himself.</p>
