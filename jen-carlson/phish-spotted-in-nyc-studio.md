<p><img alt="phpFfpnyhAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083606im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpFfpnyhAM.jpg" width="350" height="262" class="left"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083606/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/09/video_of_the_day_phish_reunites_in.php">In September</a>, the band Phish (assumed to have still been disbanded at the time) reunited at friend/former road manager Brad Sand&apos;s wedding, giving hope to the hemp set that the foursome would soon have a proper reunion. Miracles <em>do happen</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083606/http://phish.com/news/index.php?year=2008#story409">it was announced</a> soon after that the band would play three concerts in Hampton, Virginia next March. Well, for those of you who haven&apos;t hit up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083606/http://jambands.com/News.phtml?newsfile=redesign_news391.html#11-20-36">Jambands.com</a> in a couple days, you may have missed out on this little nugget: That photo is allegedly of the band rehearsing in a Brooklyn studio. </p>

<p>The website notes that &quot;Though the photograph&apos;s author is unknown, the shot is believed to be real.&quot; Is this to become the borough&apos;s very own Sasquatch photo, or <em>is it the real deal?</em> The site confirms the band has been seen out and about in New York; &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083606/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/22/mike_gordon_phish.php">Mike Gordon</a> and Page McConnell attended photographer Jay Blakesberg&#x2019;s New York book signing Monday. Gordon was also spotted at the final night of Phil Lesh&#x2019;s Nokia residency Tuesday.&quot;</p>

<p>A little investigating led us to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083606/http://www.troutrecording.com/">Trout Recording</a> in Park Slope, where some of the band members have recorded in the past. A call to the studios this morning was fielded by Bryce Goggin, who told us, <strong>&quot;There is not a band called Phish in my studio at this time.&quot;</strong> Our secret decoder ring unscrambled this lexical puzzle and told us that it&apos;s all but confirmed: Phish is in Park Slope either rehearsing or recording or both! Secret show at Union Hall all but confirmed!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Commenter &quot;jrocket&quot; says this photo is from SIR Studios on West 25th Street in Manhattan, as all-but-proven by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083606/http://www.sirny.com/img/stage3Photo.jpg">this photo</a> from their website of a space that looks very similar to the above. Allegedly they were there as recently as &quot;the beginning of this week,&quot; but may be moving around.</p>
