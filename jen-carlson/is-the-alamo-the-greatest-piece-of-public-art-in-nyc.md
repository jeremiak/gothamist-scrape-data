<span class="photo_caption">This is how I first saw the Alamo: a dusty cube with nothing to offer...</span>
<p></p>
The Alamo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://gothamist.com/tags/alamo">the black cube</a> that has balanced on its corner in Astor Place for nearly 50 years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/19/the_astor_place_cube_will_be_back_o.php">will return</a> to its spot this week* after some renovations to the area demanded it take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/15/astor_place_cube_poof.php">a 14-month leave of absence</a>. 
<p></p>
Originally I wrote a scathing takedown of the Cube, as it&apos;s also called, declaring it one of New York City&apos;s many pieces of mediocre public art (<em>prove me wrong</em>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/16/best_public_art_nyc.php"><em>this</em> is the best we&apos;ve got</a>?!). &quot;It&apos;s just a dirty spinning block that does nothing more than attract drunk college students to a central location&#x2014;a public amusement for the young, inebriated newbies in town,&quot; I wrote. But by the time I got to the end, I realized I kind of loved this ugly hunk of steel. It&apos;s not a looker, but its lack of aesthetic appeal is just as charming as its familiarity.
<p></p>
Maybe it reminds you of those times you&apos;d get stoned and walk around St. Mark&apos;s, and perhaps looking at it now you recall your youth, or what you&#x2014;disillusioned by the past&#x2014;now see as a better or cooler version of NYC. It&apos;s your own personal black box, holding all your memories. A touchstone to your own past, one that you can still go visit and, literally, give a spin. And you <em>can</em> spin it if you&apos;ve got enough people&#x2014;maybe this thing is a metaphor for struggling to survive in NYC. It takes a village, etc. Or maybe we just like spinning things.

<p>Listen, the Alamo is fine, it can stay, but let it partially be a reminder that we can do better in the arena of public art. Maybe its dirty exterior and existential void of a surface can be balanced out by, say, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/12/what_if_mr_darcy_was_in_the_east_ri.php">Mr. Darcy in the East River</a>?

Have you ever seen 3D chalk art on our sidewalks? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://www.thisismarvelous.com/optical-illusions-by-julian-beever-3d-chalk-drawings-that-will-trick-your-eyes/">It&apos;s goddamn magical</a>.</p>

<p>Until we see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_Duck_(sculpture)">a giant rubber duck</a> in the Hudson, let&apos;s learn something about our Cube&#x2014;here are some facts about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/arts/design/01rosenthal.html">Bernard Rosenthal</a>&apos;s Alamo, prior to its big return:</p><ul><li>Rosenthal&apos;s wife named the sculpture, &quot;because its scale and mass reminded her of the Alamo Mission.&quot;<br>
</li><li>It was part of the Cultural Showcase Festival exhibition in October of 1967.<br>
</li><li>Following its debut, neighbors petitioned to make it a permanent installation, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0DF1631E23BBC4B51DFB767838C679EDE&amp;legacy=true">the NY Times</a>. <br>
</li><li>The paper also notes that the donor was &quot;anonymous, but Rosenthal played some part in the donation.&quot; <br>
</li><li>Alamo is made from black-coated Cor-Ten steel, &quot;a metal 40% stronger than ordinary steel.&quot;<br>
</li><li>It weighs thousands of pounds (the NY Times says 3,000, though 1,800 is noted elsewhere).<br>
</li><li>Over the years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/nyregion/fyi-015814.html">people have reported</a> the cube as being &quot;stuck,&quot; but that&apos;s most likely due to the fact that they are trying to spin it on their own. See previous bullet point.<br>
</li><li>There have been a number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamo_(sculpture)#Pranks">dumb pranks</a> involving the Cube.<br>
</li><li>And finally, it&apos;s totally unoriginal&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223421/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/everyone_has_an_astor_place_cube.php">Rosenthal made four others</a> just like it. Even Ohio has a Cube!</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Alamo returns Wednesday*, weather-permitting, but tell it how you really feel before then:</p>

<p>*A rep for the NYC Department of Design and Construction tells us, &quot;We are still on track with the project. The Cube is awaiting final inspection by the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation. Once completed it will be delivered and installed,&quot; but it&apos;s possible this could happen <em>after</em> Wednesday. It&apos;ll be a surprise!<br>
