<p>Since June of 1977, people have waited on line for <em>Star Wars</em> films, solidifying the community of fans, becoming tradition, and bringing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035401/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/simon-diaz-an-organizer-of-nyline-puts-sodas-in-a-cooler-news-photo/52757668">this important R2-D2 cooler</a> into existence.

They were not just people going to the movies.&apos;&apos; And that remains true today.</p>

<p>The photo above, circa <em>The Return of the Jedi</em> (1983), was taken outside of Loews Astor Plaza in Times Square&#x2014;this was New York&apos;s largest single-screen theater (it had 1,440 seats!) until it closed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035401/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/nyregion/coming-soon-the-end-new-york-s-largest-single-screen-theater-is-closing.html">in 2004</a>. The Best Buy Theater occupies that space now.</p>
