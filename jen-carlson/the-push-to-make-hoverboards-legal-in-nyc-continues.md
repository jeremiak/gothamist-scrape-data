<p>The law prohibiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406060103/http://gothamist.com/tags/hoverboards">hoverboards</a> in NYC continues to be challenged. Last month we reported that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406060103/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/mcfly_and_get_fined.php">these personal transportation devices are illegal</a> in NYC, after an NYPD precinct tweeted out a reminder. That tweet, which was deleted after our report went up, sparked considerable debate about the motorized boards&#x2014;presumably because no one previously knew they were illegal.</p>

<p>NYC Councilman Andy King almost immediately proposed that they be made legal on sidewalks and in parks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406060103/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/20/hoverboardist.php">but added that</a> they &quot;should not be operated on the roads alongside cars, buses and trucks.&quot; King isn&apos;t 100% pro-hoverboard, however, he told us that &quot;riding a hoverboard decreases physical activity... walking is more beneficial for your heart and lungs than riding a hover board all day.&quot; </p>

<p>Now Senator Jose Peralta (Queens) has introduced a bill to make the hoverboards legal, calling the $200 fines for operating one in NYC a cash grab by the NYPD&#x2014;&quot;the ban is all about raising money and increasing their ticket quotas,&quot; he told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406060103/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/queens-state-senator-legalize-hoverboards-article-1.2460998">the Daily News</a>. However, the NYPD doesn&apos;t appear to be actively ticketing hoverboarders, and some officers don&apos;t even know they&apos;re illegal.</p>

<p>Currently hoverboards are viewed as motor vehicles that cannot be registered in New York, meaning you can own a hoverboard, but you can&apos;t operate it. Peralta&apos;s bill would change this, taking them out from under the &quot;motor vehicle&quot; umbrella, and making them more similar to a skateboard. In a memo regarding his bill, Peralta stated: &quot;There is no evidence to suggest that an all-out ban on hoverboards is in the public interest. Further, no party has argued that the DMV should institute a registration scheme that encompasses hoverboard devices.&#x201D;</p>
