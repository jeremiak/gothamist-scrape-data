</div></div><p>What&apos;s the strangest thing <em>you&apos;ve</em> ever put in storage? One man sent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185912/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/03/25/70s_nyc_skyline_lives_on_in_brooklyn_storage_locker.php">Curbed</a> some photos from his Brooklyn storage locker, which contains 10 chairs adorned with some of the city&apos;s landmark buildings. He says they were created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185912/http://www.franksiciliano.com/fpsdesign/furn_ms_01.html">Frank Peter Siciliano</a> in the late &apos;70s (though some say they&apos;re from the &apos;80s). Together, the piece is called &quot;Manhattan Suite&quot; and it used to be owned by Automotive Tycoon Malcolm Bricklin, who purchased it for $250K a few decades ago. The current owner says he hopes to get the pieces into a museum&#x2014;though they would make a pretty sweet conversation piece for the dining room.</p>
