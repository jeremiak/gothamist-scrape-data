<p>What kind of person steals anything (except weed, we&apos;d sort of <em>get that</em>) from country music legend Willie Nelson? When the musician performed at Port Chester&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130925224158/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/capitol_theatre.php">Capitol Theatre</a> last week, a fan snatched up the band&apos;s stuffed armadillo, which was sitting on stage as the crew broke things down at the end of the night.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130925224158/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130924/NEWS/309240051?nclick_check=1">to LoHud</a>, the stuffed animal is named Ol&#x2019; Dillo, and he&apos;s a beloved part of traveling road show, belonging to the band&#x2019;s engineer Aaron Foye. Capitol&apos;s manager explains, &quot;It was during load-out. The monitor engineer said, &apos;Hey, where&apos;s my armadillo?&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>His captor was caught on tape, and the video was posted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130925224158/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151894791022733">Nelson&apos;s Facebook page</a>, where his team asked: &quot;Someone stole Aaron&apos;s Armadillo... Did you go to the show? Did you work the show? Help us find the woman in this video who stole him.&quot; You&apos;ll see her stepping off the stage towards the end:</p>
