<p>Last night the annual In Memorium segment of the Oscars failed to mention a few names (last year they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711120706/http://laist.com/2010/03/08/did_the_oscars_snub_farrah_fawcett.php">snubbed Brad Renfro, Farrah Fawcett, and Bea Arthur</a>!). This year the &quot;forgotten&quot; few <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711120706/http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/oscars-in-memoriam-didnt-mention/">included</a> <strike>composer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711120706/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/31/composer_john_barry_dies_at_77.php">John Barry</a></strike>, Oscar-nominated Don Peterman (cinematographer for <em>Splash</em>, and many others), CAA agent Marty Baum, French filmmaker and screenwriter Eric Rohmer, Maria Schneider of <em>Last Tango in Paris</em>, Monica Johnson (co-writer for many Albert Brooks films), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711120706/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/rip_len_uncle_leo_lesser.php">Len Lesser</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711120706/http://gothamist.com/tags/coreyhaim">Corey Haim</a> (Canada is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711120706/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/945955--corey-haim-among-actors-snubbed-by-oscar-s-memorial">particularly pissed off about this</a>). Who else did the Academy intentionally (or unintentionally) forget to include this year?</p>

<p>When Haim was dissed by the Screen Actors Guild earlier this year, Corey Feldman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711120706/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/corey-feldman-criticizes-sag-omitting-94701">declared</a>, <strong>&quot;We have become used to not being honored by our peers in the industry.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Those who did get screen time included Tony Curtis, Gloria Stuart, Leslie Nielsen, Lynn Redgrave, and Dennis Hopper. Halle Berry also gave tribute to Lena Horne.</p>
