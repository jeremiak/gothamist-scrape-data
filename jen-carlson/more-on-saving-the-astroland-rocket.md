<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150828/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/11/astroland_rocket_asscrap_metal.php">Yesterday</a> the alerts went out that Coney Island redevelopment&apos;s latest target, the Astroland Rocket, needed a home...and fast! The Coney Island History Project contacted us to say that they, along with Astroland staffers, &quot;have been working feverishly for the past month to find a museum or other venue willing and able to take the rocket. Preferably in Coney Island, or at least Brooklyn...Several museums wanted it but had to decline due to lack of space or logistical issues. Several are still considering the offer.&quot; </p>
