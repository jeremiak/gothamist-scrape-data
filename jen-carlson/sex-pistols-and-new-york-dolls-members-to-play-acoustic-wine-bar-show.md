What if we told you they weren&apos;t doing a tour of dirty, old clubs, but were instead sidling up to quaint wine bars and cafes? What if we told you they would only be performing ACOUSTIC?</p>

<p>It&apos;s all true. The tour was announced in an email we assumed was from The Onion, and will feature songs spanning over the decades. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141839/http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Pistols+bassist+Glen+Matlock+town+with+Acoustic+Anarchy+tour/8159771/story.html#ixzz2Owb31RSQ">Matlock says</a>, &#x201C;I treat my shows like a wedding. I do something new, something old, something borrowed and something a little bit bluesy. And it seems to fit the bill. I&#x2019;m not claiming to change the world. <strong>It&#x2019;s a great night and you don&#x2019;t go home with your ears ringing</strong>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In New York City, the duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141839/http://www.citywinery.com/newyork/tickets/the-punk-goes-acoustic-tour-glen-matlock-sex-pistols-sylvain-sylvain-new-york-dolls-4-1.html">will rock City Winery</a> on April Fools Day, <em>but the tour is no joke.</em> They&apos;ll also play New Haven, a few spots in New Jersey, and the Jammin Java in Virginia. Will Johnny Rotten show up for some heckling? Will acoustic guitars get smashed? Nah, you&apos;ll probably just go home with a nice wine buzz, stomach full of gouda, and bragging rights that you were there when punk <em>officially</em> officially died.</p>
