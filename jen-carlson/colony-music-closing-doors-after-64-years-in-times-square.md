<p>After 64 years of holding it down in Times Square, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064440/http://www.colonymusic.com/">Colony Music</a> will close its doors next month. The store confirmed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064440/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2012/08/colony-music.html">VanishingNY</a> that they&apos;ll be shutting down, but didn&apos;t give an exact date. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064440/http://www.yelp.com/biz/colony-records-new-york">not everyone&apos;s a fan</a> of the shop, Charles Hutchinson of Academy Music reacted with sadness, saying, &quot;I&apos;m heartsick when any unique business that promotes music, books, and culture in general gets forced out of this city... Record Stores, despite all the vinyl-is-back hubbub, are proving to be as vulnerable as the next mom-&amp;-pop in the Bloombergian Era.&quot;</p>

<p>Colony&#x2014;originally opened by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064440/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/09/nyregion/h-s-grossbardt-85-record-store-founder.html">Harold S. &quot;Nappy&quot; Grossbardt</a> and Sidney Turk in 1948&#x2014;is home to one of the largest collections of sheet music in the country, and used to see many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064440/http://www.trippingwithmarty.com/almost-live-from-new-york-city/tag/colony-records">famous musicians</a> coming through its doors. In 2009, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064440/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/nyregion/13experience.html?_r=1">the NY Times</a> took a stroll down memory lane, publishing some great anecdotes and memories of the store&#x2014;when James Brown first visited, he looked around and said, &quot;This smells like a music store.&quot; Michael Jackson was a customer since his days in the Jackson 5, and when he got older he had a secret entrance and knock when he wanted to visit.</p>

<p>The original storefront was actually at Broadway and 52nd Street, but in 1970 they moved to 1619 Broadway, inside of the Brill Building. Currently the owner (Mike, Harold&apos;s son) is not commenting on why they are closing. Here he is flipping through some finds:</p>

<p>In 2010 a group raised money through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064440/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1386333480/manhattan-lullaby-a-documentary-about-colony-recor">Kickstarter</a> for a documentary on the store, called Manhattan Lullaby... hopefully now they&apos;ll finish it.</p>
