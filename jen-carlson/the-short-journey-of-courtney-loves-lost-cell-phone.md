                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="phpcbNyLQAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194156im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpcbNyLQAM.jpg" width="238" height="350"> <br> <i style=" width:238px; ;display:block"> (Getty)</i></div> Courtney Love&apos;s iPhone, in a bold move to escape its captor&#x2014;who is rumored to have neutered its ability to autocorrect&#x2014;managed to slide away in Love&apos;s cab last night. It was almost caught when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194156/http://www.free-ringtones.cc/ringtones/Tiptoes/95423">its &quot;Tiptoes&quot; tone</a> started sounding, but through a lucky break managed to taste freedom. <p></p>

<p>The cabbie would later tell reporters that once the rock goddess departed the cab, the iPhone was seen shedding what appeared to be real human tears of joy. It told the cabbie of the incessant tiny punches to its fragile face&#x2014;&quot;all the texting, all the Tweets, none of them even make sense to me.&quot;</p>

<p>When a new fare entered the cab the iPhone noticed immediately it was New York Times Op-Ed columnist Frank Bruni. It tried to hide, but it was too late, the ever-ethical Mr. Bruni spotted the phone, and was immediately committed to doing the right thing: return it to its rightful owner. </p>

<p>The iPhone begged Bruni, &quot;Please, please don&apos;t do this, she can get another phone, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194156/https://twitter.com/johnjcook/status/403571842176135168">sell me to Gawker</a>, destroy me, anything, I just can&apos;t go back.&quot; But Bruni had to be the Hero; the iPhone saw it on his face. </p>

<p>When reached for comment, iPhone seemed optimistic that Love would &quot;lose&quot; it again, and until then, said at least there was this fresh feeling of freedom, adding, &quot;it all feels like a dream now.&quot;</p>
