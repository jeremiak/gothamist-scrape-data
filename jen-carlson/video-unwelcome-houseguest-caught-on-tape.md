title: Video: Unwelcome Houseguest Caught on Tape?
---

	
										<p>If this video is real, get ready to have a new fear after absorbing all 5 minutes and 51 seconds of it. In short: this guy noticed food missing from his apartment and set up a hidden camera, the footage of which showed a woman living in a lofted storage area and coming out in the middle of the night to raid his fridge and pee in his sink. We sort of want it to be real in the same way we wanted the <em>Blair Witch Project</em> to be real.</p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/06X9qXTvKNQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140605200930oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/06X9qXTvKNQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>But it can&apos;t be real, <em>right</em>? We&apos;re guessing that it&apos;s viral marketing for <em>something</em>, perhaps the website it was originally posted on, which has an author that looks suspiciously like the lanky lady caught creeping in the apartment. We contacted them to get some answers and they directed us to their publicist, who assures us that this is in no way viral marketing for the website. So far they haven&apos;t been able to give us an answer as to how they came upon the video, or provide us with the man&apos;s name or what neighborhood he lives in so we can call the precinct... but they have asked us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140605200930/http://www.nakedapartments.com/blog/creepy-creeper/">to link back to their site</a> if we posted it. So with that, the needle on our bullshit detector is in the red.</p>
