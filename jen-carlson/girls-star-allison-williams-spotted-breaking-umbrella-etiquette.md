<p>While the girls on <em>Girls</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064500/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/last_nights_girls_forget_about_the.php#photo-1">never wear protection</a> during their sexual encounters, at least one of them is overly-protective when it comes to the elements. Breaking one of New York&apos;s only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064500/http://gothamist.com/tags/umbrellaetiquette">weather etiquette rules</a>, Allison Williams stepped out this week with A HUGE FREAKING MONSTER UMBRELLA.</p>

<p>The starlet was protecting her shiny locks as she made her way to the Jimmy Fallon show, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064500/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2292547/Girls-star-Allison-Williams-employs-HUGE-umbrella-protect-glossy-locks-elements.html">the Daily Mail</a> has four other photos of the faux pas... and the umbrella couldn&apos;t fit into the frame of any of them.</p>

<p>New Yorkers, Ms. Williams wasn&apos;t the only one to break this rule of etiquette this week, so let this be a reminder that should you even contemplate procuring a golf umbrella, we will not hesitate to publicly shame you. Our sidewalks just aren&apos;t big enough. </p>
