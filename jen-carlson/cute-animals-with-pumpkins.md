<p>Who can&apos;t use a little cute animal &quot;news&quot; on a Monday? Prospect Park Zoo recently introduced &quot;a trio of new yellow footed rock wallabies in the Australian Walkabout on Discovery Trail,&quot; and they sent us this photo of one of them with a pumpkin! Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081055/http://www.wcs.org/">the WCS</a> loves giving its animals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081055/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/31/happy_halloween_from_the_wildlife_c.php">pumpkin treats</a> around Halloween, even the snow leopard had some fun with one at Central Park Zoo recently:</p>

<p>Also, while there were no pumpkins involved, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081055/http://videos.silive.com/2009/10/kissing_prairie_dogs.html">these two prairie dogs</a> were caught kissing at the Staten Island Zoo... adorable! Video after the jump...</p>
