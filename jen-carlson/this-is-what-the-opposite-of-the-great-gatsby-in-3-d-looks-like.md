<p>This handwritten first page of F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324065236/http://gothamist.com/tags/thegreatgatsby"><em>The Great Gastby</em></a> has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324065236/http://espressobrooklyn.tumblr.com/post/29502322263/great-gatsby-manuscript-page-1">making the rounds</a> recently, and with the classic novel coming back to the big screen in a 3D adaptation by Baz Luhrmann (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324065236/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/20/jazz_age_lawn_party_revelers_discus.php#photo-6">some fear</a> &quot;It might be too Baz Luhrmanny&quot;), it&apos;s nice to look back at where it all began. When Fitzgerald sat down to pen this page, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324065236/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/the_great_gatsby_trailer_is_here.php">giant novelty-sized bottles of Mo&#xEB;t</a> only existed in booze-soaked dreams. Anyway, why hasn&apos;t anyone created a &quot;Great Gatsby&quot; font off of this yet?</p>
