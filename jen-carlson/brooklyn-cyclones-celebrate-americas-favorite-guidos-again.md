<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="jerseysurejersey0710.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110627144046im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jerseysurejersey0710.jpg" width="250" height="184" class="image-right"> </span>Last year the Brooklyn Cyclones announced a night dedicated to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110627144046/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> (the show!), following the news that Mike &quot;The Situation&quot; Sorrentino used to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110627144046/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/28/brooklyn_has_a_situation.php">tell the ladies</a> he was the back-up third baseman on the team (yes, that was his pick-up line!). Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110627144046/http://www.brooklyncyclones.com/">the Cyclones</a> are back with another &quot;Jersey? Sure!&quot; night coming up on the 21st of July.  From a press release we just received:</p><blockquote>The first 2,500 fans in attendance for the 7 p.m. game will receive a limited edition Cyclones jersey featuring a picture of the team&apos;s mascot, Sandy the Seagull, in a fist-pumping pose.  Fans can also participate in Dugout Dance Battles to techno beats, get a Baseball Blowout from on-site hair stylists, or win gift certificates from local vendors for &quot;Gym, Tanning and Laundry!&quot;</blockquote>If you get a Baseball Blowout, please document the experience and send it to us!<p></p>
