</div></div>					<p>In 2004 a movie called <em>Tre Metri Sopra il Cielo</em> (based on a 1992 novel by Federico Moccia) hit the big screen&#x2014;it included a scene where a couple secured their love (via a lock) to a bridge, and then tossed the keys into the river below. In Italy this has plagued the Ponte Milvio, and since then it&apos;s become an increasing occurrence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174935/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/27/will_love_locks_take_over_the_brook.php">on the Brooklyn Bridge</a>. The Department of Transportation keeps this physical embodiment of true love from spreading, and has been tasked with ripping the locks off. Harsh but NECESSARY, romantics.</p>

<p>Recently a reader named Mark Roberts spent some time with the guys (yes, all men, <em>naturally</em>) who cut the &quot;love locks&quot; off of the bridge, and sent us this takeaway from his time with the team:</p><blockquote>&quot;Walk over the Brooklyn Bridge lately and you can&apos;t help but notice the increase in padlocks engraved with messages of love affixed to the cables and railings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174935/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bridges/bridges.shtml">A team</a> from the DOT patrols the bridge two or three times a month to insure that the exponential proliferation of locks doesn&apos;t reduce the bridge to Roebling rubble. <p></p>

<p>Most locks yield easily to the team&apos;s industrial-strength bolt cutters (one wonders about the commitment of couples whose love is symbolized by locks meant for luggage zippers). Some locks have resisted multiple attacks. Today&apos;s recalcitrant restraints included a straight-shackle padlock perfectly fitted to a steel lattice fence (Chrissy and Dorian, nothing short of a blowtorch will part you!), and a fist-sized lever padlock apparently made in the 19th century that elicited the cry, &apos;We&apos;d be better off cutting the lamppost it&apos;s attached to!&apos;</p>

<p>The guys seemed to enjoy the challenge of the toughest locks and the ribbing of the tourists who accused them of homewrecking.&quot;</p></blockquote>The broken locks are fated to land in a recycling bin... which is sort of deep and meaningful and depressing on its own.<p></p>

<p>Click through for a look at the pure joy that comes from physically breaking the symbols of <em>forever love</em>.</p>
