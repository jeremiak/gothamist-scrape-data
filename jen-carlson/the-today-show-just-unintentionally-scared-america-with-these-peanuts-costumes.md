---

	
										<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330205858/http://www.today.com/news/today-goes-nuts-halloween-peanuts-see-our-charlie-brown-gang-t53131">the Today Show</a> cast accomplished what no one has ever been able to in the very long history of the beloved Peanuts gang. They slipped into the body skins of each character and scared the shit out of America. We present the images below without comments, because we are sitting in the corner of a padded room, shaking.</p>
