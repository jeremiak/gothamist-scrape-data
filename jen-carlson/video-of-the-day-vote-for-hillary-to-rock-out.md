title: Video of the Day: Vote for Hillary to Rock Out
---

	
										<p>Senator Hillary Clinton is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232357/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/action/spotlight/?sc=8">asking the public</a> for some advice on what may very well be the most important part of her campaign: The Song. </p>

<p>The choices: &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot; - U2, &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; - U2, &quot;I&apos;m a Believer&quot; - Smash Mouth&apos;s cover of the Monkees&apos; song, &quot;Get Ready&quot; - The Temptations, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; - Jesus Jones, &quot;Suddenly I See&quot; - KT Tunstall, &quot;Ready to Run&quot; - Dixie Chicks, &quot;Rock This Country!&quot; - Shania Twain, &quot;I&apos;ll Take You There&quot; - The Staple Singers</p>

<p>This is what democracy is for, people. You can cast your vote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232357/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/action/spotlight/?sc=8">here</a>, and below you can hear what Hillary has to say about it:</p>

<p align="center"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3FV7XU-TLMU"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232357oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/3FV7XU-TLMU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></object>
</p><p>
We don&apos;t think this was carefully enough thought out, however. Why Smash Mouth&apos;s cover of &quot;I&apos;m a Believer&quot;? No one likes Smash Mouth, and Neil Diamond does a perfectly good cover of that song (he&apos;s also the one who penned it in the first place). And &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;? As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232357/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=Yjg3MDI3YWMxZjkxMTU3NmVmNjVkMTllNDdmYWMxMmE=">Todd Seavey points out</a>: 

</p><blockquote>It may sound like danceable synthesizer fluff, but &#x2014; shamefully for Western civilization &#x2014; &#x201C;Right Here, Right Now,&#x201D; released in 1990, was the only prominent rock song to properly celebrate the collapse of European Communism: &#x201C;I saw the decade end / And saw the world could change in the blink of an eye...I was alive and I waited for this...Right here, right now / Watching the world wake up from history.&#x201D; &#x201C;Right Here, Right Now&#x201D; is one of the few rock songs/videos that clearly celebrates the failure of socialism and the resistance to central government authority.</blockquote>

<p>Seavey also suggests some songs as an alternative. Here are some choices we think she <em>clearly</em> overlooked: </p>

<p>&quot;Extraordinary&quot; - Liz Phair</p>

<p><em>&quot;I am extraordinary, if you&apos;d ever get to know me / I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary / Average every day sane psycho / Supergoddess / Average every day sane psycho&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m Real&quot; - J. Lo</p>

<p><em>&quot;Now people lovin&apos; me and hatin&apos; me, treatin&apos; me ungratefully / But not knowin&apos; that they ain&apos;t makin&apos; or breakin&apos; me / My life, I live it to the limit and I love it / Now I can breathe again, baby now I can breathe again&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; - Gwen Stefani</p>

<p><em>&quot;I heard that you were talking shit / And you didn&apos;t think that I would hear it / People hear you talking like that, getting everybody fired up / So I&apos;m ready to attack, gonna lead the pack / Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out / That&apos;s right, put your pom-poms downs, getting everybody fired up / A few times I&apos;ve been around that track / So it&apos;s not just gonna happen like that / Because I ain&apos;t no hollaback girl / I ain&apos;t no hollaback girl&quot;</em></p>

<p>But really, will anything ever beat her husband and Al Gore&apos;s campaign song in &apos;92? <em>&quot;Don&apos;t stop, thinking about tomorrow / Don&apos;t stop, it&apos;ll soon be here / It&apos;ll be, better than before / Yesterday&apos;s gone, yesterday&apos;s gone.&quot;</em> Probably not. What song would you vote for? </p>
