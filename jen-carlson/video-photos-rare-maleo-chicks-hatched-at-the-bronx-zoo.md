<p>According to a press release we just received: &quot;Three rare maleo chicks have been hatched at the Wildlife Conservation Society&apos;s Bronx Zoo after careful study and re-creation of the specialized conditions needed for the successful incubation of this endangered bird&#x2019;s eggs.&quot; In other words: unusual little birds! </p>

<p>The Zoo is now home to nine maleos, including the three new chicks&#x2014;this is the only place these birds can bee seen outside of their native home on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.</p><blockquote>Maleos are listed as Endangered by the International Union of Conservation and Nature and their numbers in the wild have seen a sharp decline in recent years due to human egg collection for food and predation by invasive species introduced to their habitat. The nesting sites protected by WCS represent the last chance for the species in the wild as other nesting sites on the island are at great risk of being destroyed and abandoned.</blockquote>You can catch a glimpse as the creatures in the below video, though we recommend muting it and replacing its soundtrack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155409/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZE4HYfoQo4">with a little more <em>suspense</em></a>.<p></p>
