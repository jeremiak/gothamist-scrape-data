<p>Earlier this evening the Bed-Stuy restaurant Do Or Dine (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122922/http://gothamist.com/tags/doordine">a fave around these parts</a>) Tweeted a link to this photo on their Facebook, asking: &#x201D;Too Soon? Scary news sucks. This doesn&#x2019;t. Presenting the Miami Openface with Smoked &#x2018;Bath Salts.&#x2019;&#x201D; Apparently for some it <em>was</em> &quot;too soon&quot; after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122922/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/28/witness_to_horrific_miami_face-chew.php">the horrifying incident</a> in Miami, as they soon deleted it. </p>

<p>We asked the restaurant about it, and a rep told us: &quot;The majority of people thought that it was the culinary equivalent of an article in The Onion.   A few people were very displeased with us.  As a restaurant, we are not in the business of displeasing anyone, so we have removed the post.  We are indeed guilty of telling a bad and tasteless joke on the internet, and we are very sorry to all who we have offended... although <strong>we, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122922/http://observer.com/2012/05/brooklyn-restaurant-debuts-and-immediately-deletes-dish-inspired-by-miami-face-eating-incident-on-twitter/">unlike the New York Observer</a>, are not dismissing the crime as a &apos;Zombie Attack&apos; which we believe is more insincere and degrading</strong>.&quot; Indeed. </p>

<p>The rep at Do Or Dine  (a restaurant is known for its quirky and often humorous dishes) added, &quot;We were not planning on serving the dish to anyone more than our regulars who we thought would see the dish in the light that we did&#x2014;&apos;This is terrible news, we don&apos;t like terrible news... here is another way to look at it that isn&apos;t so terrible:  A cuban on one piece of bread with salt on the side.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Elsewhere, someone created (and also deleted) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122922/http://alexblagg.tumblr.com/post/24119331803/yelp-review-of-that-guys-face-by-rudy-the">a Yelp review</a> for &quot;This Guy&apos;s Face,&quot; giving it four stars.</p>
