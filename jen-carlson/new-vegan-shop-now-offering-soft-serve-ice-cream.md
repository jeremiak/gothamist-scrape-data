</div></div>					<p>Summer&apos;s not over yet, and the newest vegan spot in town is introducing soft serve ice cream to their menu. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175559/http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegan-divas-new-york">Vegan Divas</a> on the Upper East Side opened last month, and offers all-vegan sweet treats, including caramel pecan brownies, olive oil muffins, and doughnuts&#x2014;their menu even features the calorie counts of all of these items. But those are all pretty standard vegan bakery items&#x2014;we&apos;re mostly interested in their latest offering, the vegan soft serve ice cream, which you can&apos;t find everywhere (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175559/http://www.yelp.com/biz/lulas-sweet-apothecary-new-york">Lula&apos;s</a> still has some last time we checked).</p>

<p>The Vegan Divas tell us their frozen treat is gluten-free, kosher, cholesterol-free, and made with an organic tofu base, vanilla bean, and ginger. Every 5 ounces contains 60 calories (which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175559/http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/generic/ice-cream-soft-serve?portionid=180371&amp;portionamount=5.000">SIGNIFICANTLY less</a> than non-vegan soft serve), which goes up if you add toppings&#x2014;they offer: organic oats, walnuts, cranberries, flax seeds, raisins, kosher salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, brownie bits, and toasted coconut. The soft serve retails for $4.50 and is now available.</p>
