On their roster are bands such as Editors, Ambulance LTD, Stellastarr* and Two Gallants. Tonight they&apos;ll be celebrating their 3 year anniversary just down the street from their office, at Luna Lounge. The party is private, sure to have some special musical guests...and they want to invite YOU. Check out details after the interview.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us what a typical day in the +1 offices is like?</strong><br>
Every day is different from the rest, that&#x2019;s what I love about it.  I come in every morning knowing the things I want to do...and I never even come close to accomplishing what I set out to do at the beginning of the day cause I spend most of my time reacting to things.  It&#x2019;s pretty crazy and unpredictable but I love it.  It beats sitting in a cubicle.</p>

<p><strong>If the bands on your roster were your kids...who would be your favorite kid?</strong><br>
I love them all equally and unconditionally (I train people on this stuff ya know)</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
I grew up in Westchester, 40 minutes North of Manhattan.  My first memory of working in the city was my first day of work after graduating college.  I was coming in on Metro North and was late on my first day. The line to just get a Metro Card was like hundreds of people deep.  I decided to duck under the Subway entrance (I think I saw them do that in &#x2018;Kids&#x2019;) and got caught by an undercover cop and got a ticket.  It was pretty embarrassing, all of these people just staring with looks on their faces, like &#x2018;how could you actually get caught doing that?!&#x2019;   </p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out?</strong><br>
I like Clem&#x2019;s in Williamsburg.  Good vibe, tunes, people, it is kind of our local hang-out and people are there at all hours.  I hope the bartenders are reading this.  Thursday is my favorite night to go out, I don&#x2019;t do weekends.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite NY venue to see a show at?</strong><br>
Bowery, no question.  A class operation.</p>

<p><strong>A few years ago we recall you being a part of New York Post&apos;s &quot;meat market&quot; section, in which the paper attempted to find you some love...what was that experience like?!</strong><br>
Ha, I thought everyone forgot about that?  Can I just leave it at...a lot of people questioned why I did that...pretty much everyone except for my Uncle Bruce.  He totally called me out on it and I was like, finally, someone sees the positive repercussions in doing this.  Oh, and I live for the Sunday Post.</p>
