<p>Okay so we&apos;re all familiar with the Verizon eyesore on the banks of the East River, and the fact that it&apos;s hate-fuel for those who have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324221057/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/18/verizon.php">look at it from Brooklyn</a>, but now the company is taking it to the streets, and likely annoying even more of the city. Their never-ending &quot;network is always with you&quot; campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324221057/http://dpstyles.tumblr.com/post/142850006/one-of-those-verizon-network-is-always-with-you">was filming earlier</a> over near 7th Street and 1st Avenue. Did you see hundreds of red shirts clogging up the East Village today? <em>Can you see them now?</em></p>
