										<p>With the return of <em>Mad Men</em> not happening for at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150220/http://blogs.amctv.com/mad-men/talk/2010/01/when-will-seaso.php">four months</a> (they&apos;re not even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150220/http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEKNKSOS9sXWPO">in production</a> yet), we&apos;ll take any shred of the Sterling-Cooper troupe we can get... even if it comes in the form of a drunken, out-of-tune, cast and crew sing-a-long of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150220/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6iSDT4rfiQ">a song featured</a> last season). Sadly, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150220/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/04/drunken_mad_men_cast_and_crew.html">NYMag</a> points out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150220/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinahendricks">Christina Hendricks</a> and Bryan Batt don&apos;t make an appearance... which is possibly made up for by Elisabeth Moss texting in her Peggy Olson wardrobe.</p>

<p>Watch Ann Margaret give a better (albeit less entertaining) performance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150220/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t3cBTb3xPc">here</a>.</p>
