<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510140415/http://gothamist.com/tags/idiotarod">The Idiotarod</a> is around the corner, and a little bit of snow isn&apos;t about to get in the way of drunk young creatives pushing their carts around town. The race starts this Saturday at 10 a.m., and &quot;will be held regardless of rain or snow.&quot; A reminder from organizers: this is <em>not</em> a food fight, and any team caught throwing food will be asked to leave immediately.</p>

<p>This is the 8th year of the event, and this year around 40 teams have signed up to participate...however, it&apos;s unclear <em>where</em> all of this happens because organizers keep it hush-hush until the last minute (last year, the race went from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510140415/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/30/idiotarod_2.php">Williamsburg to Queens</a>; in 2009, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510140415/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/31/the_2009_idiotarod_startsnow.php">Midtown to Greenpoint</a>; and in 2008, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510140415/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/26/idiotarod.php">Chinatown to Red Hook</a>). If you catch any of them out there, send us your photos or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr. We&apos;ll be updating Saturday as the event rolls on, so stay tuned...</p>
