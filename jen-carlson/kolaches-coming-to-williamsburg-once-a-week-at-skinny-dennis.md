<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521035444/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/brooklyn_kolache_co_brings_the_belo.php">Brooklyn Kolache opened</a>, bringing the Texas treat to New York via owner and Texas ex-pat Autumn Stanford. For those not in the know, &quot;Kolaches are portable, neat-to-eat pastries that can be stuffed with savory ingredients such as eggs, sausage and cheese, or sweet house-made fillings like apricot, poppy seed and cherry.&quot; While the Bed-Stuy outpost is still one of the only places to find these pockets of joy, Stanford will take her business on the road every Saturday, starting April 27th... all the way to Williamsburg. She told us this morning:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We&apos;re really excited to share the news about our Kolache Pop Up at Skinny Dennis [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521035444/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/inside_skinny_dennis_williamsburgs.php">the city&apos;s best honky tonk</a>].  We&apos;ll be selling sweet and savory kolaches every Saturday, starting April 27th. from 12 p.m. until we sell out.  A boudin kolache and Uncle Willies frozen coffee are a match made in heaven.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Stranford tells us she&apos;ll be offering sausage, jalapeno and cheese, spicy beef hotlink with or without cheese, smoked ham and cheddar, and spinach &amp; feta savory kolaches... along with a new boudin kolache. On the sweet side, she&apos;ll have sweet cheese, sweet cheese and strawberry, sweet cheese and blueberry, apple, lemon curd, apricot and chocolate.</p>

<p>Skinny D&apos;s delicious Willie&apos;s frozen coffee (named for Willie Nelson) goes for $6, and features coffee liqueur, bourbon and brandy, and comes out of a $9,000 daiquiri machine. Though if you&apos;re going with a savory kolache, we&apos;d recommend pairing it with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521035444/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/shiner_beer_finally_coming_to_new_y.php">Shiner Bock</a>, which was on tap there as of last night.</p>
