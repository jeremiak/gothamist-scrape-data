title: Snooki Booking At Rutgers May Lead To New Legislation!
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="optoutsnooki0411.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055109im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/optoutsnooki0411.png" width="365" height="365" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier this month, America&apos;s youth&#x2014;specifically those currently enrolled at Rutgers University&#x2014;paid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055109/http://gothamist.com/tags/snooki">Snooki</a> of <em>Jersey Shore</em> an absurd amount of money to come fist pump at the school. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055109/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/snooki_gets_paid_more_than_toni_mor.php">More than the university paid Toni Morrison</a>, in fact. (Kids today! Etc.) Now Senator Joe Kyrillos is prepping a proposal in the state Senate that would essentially, hopefully, lead to better choices. </p>

<p>The Snooki booking was made by a student-run committee, using the mandatory student activity fees undergraduates must pay with their tuition. The new proposed legislation, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055109/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/following_snooki_visit_ro_rutg.html">NJ.com</a>, says students should have a clearer choice of whether they want to pay for student-planned fee-based events. As Kyrillos put it, &quot;Students ought not be forced to fund entertainment or events that they find objectionable. There were a great deal of Rutgers students who I am certain were uninterested or flat out outraged by Ms. Polizzi&apos;s appearance on campus.&quot; (She drew 1,000 students... our of around 25,000 undergrads.) He also called Snooki &quot;a degenerate&quot;!</p>

<p>If it passes, students will be able to check a box to opt out of contributing to the student activities fund. (Better get your college tour booked now, Pauly D!) But what about the rest of America&#x2014;who will save us from the fist-pumping? The show was just picked up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055109/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42497110/ns/today-entertainment/">for a 4th season</a>, and three cast members have gotten spin-off shows on top of it! You can opt out by not tuning in, we suppose.</p>
