Sorry, wait, there are some men here... okay, they&apos;re telling us this takeover is actually called: Super Bowl Boulevard Engineered By GMC. A wonderland of corporate America and sports and Papa John&apos;s pizza. </p>

<p>Super Bowl Boulevard Engineered by GMC runs on Broadway (between West 34th and West 47th Streets), and has shut down that stretch through Sunday to deliver us a &quot;free interactive fan celebration&quot; leading up to Super Bowl XLVIII, which is all the way over in New Jersey.</p>

<p>There are events every day, like performances (the cast of Rock of Ages will perform at 5 p.m. on the Roman Numerals Stage), autograph signing booths (featuring NFL players), video games, food, ball pits, a 60-feet tall and 180-feet long, eight-lane toboggan run, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211085344/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/photos_puppy_bowl.php#photo-1">PUPPIES</a>, logos, branding, hashtags, stare into this spinning wheel while drinking a Pepsi and say Super Bowl Boulevard Engineered by GMC three times for your chance to... eh, anyway, can&apos;t wait for Times Square to go back to the anti-corporate crossroads we&apos;ve all come to love.</p>
