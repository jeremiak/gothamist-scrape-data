<p>You don&apos;t need to be face down in a pile of beads on Bourbon Street to celebrate Mardi Gras&#x2014;all you need to get in the Carnival season spirit is a Sazerac. Drink it at home, drink it out of a discreet cup on a walk around your neighborhood later, drink some with friends at a bar... there are options, but the recipe stays the same. Don&apos;t mess with the recipe. Don&apos;t make a Sazerac Slushie. Keep it neat, simple, classic.</p>

<p><u><strong>SAZERAC</strong></u> (Courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154918/http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/cuisine/drinks/sazerac.html">New Orleans Online</a>)<br>
</p><ul><li>1 cube sugar<br>
</li><li>1 &#xBD; ounces (35ml) Sazerac Rye Whiskey (or whatever rye whiskey you have!)<br>
</li><li>&#xBC; ounce Herbsaint or Absinthe<br>
</li><li>3 dashes Peychaud&apos;s Bitters<br>
</li><li>Lemon peel</li></ul><br>
<em>Pack a glass with ice. In a second glass place the sugar cube and add the Peychaud&apos;s Bitters to it, then crush the sugar cube (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154918/http://cocktails.about.com/od/s/r/szrc_cktl.htm">others use simple syrup</a> here). Add the Rye Whiskey to the second glass containing the Peychaud&apos;s Bitters and sugar. Empty the ice from the first glass and coat the glass with the Herbsaint or Absinthe. Empty the whiskey/bitters/sugar mixture from the second glass into the first glass and garnish with lemon peel. Traditionalists squeeze the peel to release its essences but do not drop it into the glass.</em><p></p>
