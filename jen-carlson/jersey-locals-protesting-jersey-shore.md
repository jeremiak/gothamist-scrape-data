<p>Don&apos;t these protesters know that the more they protest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509162408/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore">MTV&apos;s <em>Jersey Shore</em></a>, the more press it&apos;s going to get? There is no chance that the network will pull the series, which is like watching a darkly tanned train wreck dripping with hair gel week after week. Currently the protesters have set up shop outside of Viacom HQ in Times Square, with messages written on pizza boxes and declaring breakout star Snooki is &quot;the dark lord&quot;! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509162408/http://fourfour.typepad.com/fourfour/2009/12/a-real-life-jersey-shore-protest.html">FourFour</a> reports from the scene &#x2014; and good news everyone: America is no longer in debt!</p>
