<p>Did you know that &quot;Cannonball&quot; is turning 20 this year? HOW ARE WE STILL ALIVE? To celebrate the anniversary of their 1993 album <em>Last Splash</em>, the sisters Deal are hitting the road again, with a stop at Brooklyn&apos;s Bell House. </p>

<p>The intimate show is the only New York area one listed (so far?) amongst their otherwise European <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620002213/http://pitchfork.com/news/49339-the-breeders-announce-last-splash-20th-anniversary-tour/">tour dates</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620002213/http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=3360554&amp;pl=bellpl">tickets go on sale tomorrow at noon</a>.</p>

<p>Below, enjoy their old classic :( &quot;Cannonball&quot;&#x2014;the video was directed by Kim Gordon and Spike Jonze (who at the time was a youthful 23 years old).</p>
