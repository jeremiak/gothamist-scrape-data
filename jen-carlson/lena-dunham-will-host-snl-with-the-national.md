<p>It honestly kind of feels like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410024829/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> has already hosted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410024829/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>? But she hasn&apos;t! And the show has just announced that she&apos;ll be taking over on March 8th. Finally, her hilarious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410024829/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls">parody</a> of what it&apos;s like to live in Brooklyn as a twenty-something will have a fitting platform. </p>

<p>This will be good though&#x2014;Dunham is truly a smart, witty young woman, and may be able to bring the show to life a bit. Also... The National are making their debut that night as musical guest. And we love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410024829/http://gothamist.com/tags/thenational">The National</a>. And we hope Matt Berninger climbs into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410024829/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxWQMyoYJBU">audience seats</a> with a bottle of Red.</p>

<p>Until that magical night of firsts, we&apos;ve got Jim Parsons (of the Big Bang Theory) and Beck in Studio 8H this weekend.</p>
