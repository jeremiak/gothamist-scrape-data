title: Fiona Apple Performs New Xmas Song: 'Trump's Nuts Roasting On An Open Fire'
---

	
										<p>With the accompaniment of just one barking dog, Fiona Apple has recorded herself singing a new take on &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (or as some call it: &#x201C;Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire&#x201D;). Stay for the whole thing, so you can see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164738/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dKdBlKgquw">Sinead O&apos;Connor moment</a> at the end, as Apple tears up a photo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164738/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>. We recommend doing the same on when you gather to celebrate the holidays (full lyrics below so you can sing along). </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear when this was recorded or how it was gifted to the world&#x2014;Apple has been pretty quiet this year, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164738/http://www.stereogum.com/1914766/fiona-apple-shares-anti-trump-christmas-song/video/">Stereogum</a> points out, and the video seems to have originally appeared on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164738/http://fionaapplerocks.tumblr.com/post/154048464562">a fan site</a>. </p>

<p><strong><u>The Christmas Song (2016)</u></strong><br>
<em>Trump&#x2019;s nuts roasting on an open fire<br>
As he keeps nipping at his foes.<br>
You&#x2019;ll cry creepy uncle <br>
Every time he arrives<br>
For he keeps clawing at your clothes<br>
Everybody knows that money and entitlement<br>
Can help to make the season white<br>
Mothers of colors with their kids out of sight<br>
Will find it hard to sleep at night.<br>
They know that Trump is on his way.<br>
He&#x2019;s got black boys in hoodies locked up on his sleigh<br>
And every working man is going to cry<br>
When they learn that ? don&#x2019;t care how you live or if you die<br>
So I&#x2019;m offering this simple phrase<br>
For kids from 1 to 92<br>
Although it&#x2019;s been said many times, many ways<br>
Merry Christmas to you</em></p>

<p>An instant classic!</p>
