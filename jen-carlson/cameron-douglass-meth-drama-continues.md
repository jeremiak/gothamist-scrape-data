The site reports that he faces 10 years to life in prison, and &quot;According to his federal complaint filed in New York, DEA agents claim they ran a 3-year investigation, proving the 30-year-old actor sold &apos;multiple pounds&apos; of crystal meth to several people&#x2014;many of whom are now cooperating in the prosecution of Douglas.&quot; He&apos;s been charged with one count of possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of crystal meth, and also one count with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of &quot;ice&quot;&#x2014;which for the non-drug savy is the purest form of meth. When he was busted in NYC, he was accepting $15,000 in cash in exchange for a promise to deliver a half pound of crystal meth, which the buyer referred to as &quot;bath salts.&quot; Douglas told him, &quot;I thought you would like them my friend ... I was so excited for you to take a bath and see for yourself.&quot;</p>
