<p>Last night, cast members of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062651/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> participated at a Q&amp;A; at The Paley Center for Media, which was moderated by <em>Mad Men</em>-superfan Brian Williams (who really needs to retire his &quot;artisanal Williamsburg&quot; jokes, one of which was dragged into the mix). And we picked up quite a lot of nuggets about the show, from marshmallow cigarettes to Sunday&apos;s &quot;terrible error&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062651/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/22/unpacking_last_nights_mad_men.php">FIRST REPORTED BY GOTHAMIST.COM</a>).</p>

<p><strong>HISTORICAL TIMESTAMPS</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>Regarding the &quot;big mistake&quot; in the last episode&#x2014;where Joan mentions she has reservations at Le Cirque, but that restaurant didn&apos;t open until 1974&#x2014;Matthew Weiner joked, &quot;Christina [Hendricks] was ad-libbing.&quot; Then admits, &quot;It was a terrible error.&quot; (We made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062651/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/22/unpacking_last_nights_mad_men.php">a small note of this on Monday</a>, which Le Cirque responded to, and then the NY Post turned it into a full page story yesterday. Apologies to Weiner &amp; Co. for blowing up the error/it&apos;s what we live for.)<br>
</li><li>Weiner says the show is &quot;not a history lesson,&quot; but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062651/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmenhistory">historical timestamps</a> are important to the show.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>MISC. <em>MAD MEN</em> FACTS</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>In the last episode, an Old Spanish cocktail is ordered. This was a tip of the hat to <em>30 Rock</em>, and is not a real drink. On the sitcom, it was made of red wine, tonic and olives.<br>
</li><li>Kiernan Shipka has amazing posture.<br>
</li><li>They have some magical basecamp on set with a fireplace and twinkly lights.<br>
</li><li>Elizabeth Moss (&quot;Lizzie,&quot; they called her) is the president of basecamp, and made herself a plaque declaring it so.<br>
</li><li>The cast often plays games while waiting to shoot, including Dangerboat, dominos, and card games.<br>
</li><li>They really smoke the cigarettes on the show, which the cast says are made of &quot;rose petals, marshmallow... no nicotine or tar.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>THE CAST</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>Each character has a musical theme composed by David Carbonara.<br>
</li><li>Jessica Par&#xE9; reminded Weiner of a French movie star from the 1960s, and says it was &quot;fetishistic&quot; for him to cast her.<br>
</li><li>Par&#xE9; is incredibly charming, and joked that she&apos;s so thrilled about being a part of the show that when people come up to her on the street and say, &quot;You play Megan on Mad Men,&quot; she wants to respond, &quot;YES!!! I KNOW!! ISN&apos;T IT GREAT?!?!?&quot;<br>
</li><li>Kartheiser and Slattery say they don&apos;t watch the show while they are still filming&#x2014;it makes them too self conscious.<br>
</li><li>Speaking of Sneaky Pete, he cut us in line at the bar at the after party (he ordered a martini). Classic Sneaky Pete.<br>
</li><li>January Jones joked that she dyed her hair brown because if she didn&apos;t Weiner would kill her off&#x2014;he said that his mom changed her hair color when he was young, and he told her, &quot;you&apos;re ugly, I hate it.&quot; Which is how Bobby reacted when he saw Betty&apos;s new hair color.<br>
</li><li>Jon Hamm reads some recaps because he likes reading intelligent people&apos;s thoughts&#x2014;&quot;I don&apos;t get all of it&quot; so it&apos;s nice when it&apos;s explained... but he avoids comments sections because they are a &quot;nightmare.&quot;<br>
</li><li>When we spoke with Hamm at the party following the Q&amp;A;, he told us he reads recaps by Alan Sepinwall, Maureen Ryan, and the AV Club. He also says he has read Gothamist... so we&apos;ll take this moment to formally apologize for any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062651/http://gothamist.com/tags/jonhammsham">Hamm&apos;s Ham</a> &quot;articles,&quot; we just thought it would be a good way to get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062651/https://twitter.com/jenist/statuses/314458197069021184">our student loan forgiven</a>.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>THE SHOW</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>Where is Peggy and Pete&apos;s kid? Weiner says: &quot;Gone into the Catholic church&apos;s adoption system... it&apos;s untraceable, you can&apos;t find your birth parents. I guess you could now, but it&apos;s pretty hard.&quot;<br>
</li><li>They finished filming this season less than a week ago, last Thursday. Weiner says he has all the footage, but it&apos;s not edited yet.<br>
</li><li>Weiner says they aim to write <em>maybe</em> six scripts before filming, but after that: &quot;there&apos;s a train coming,&quot; and you need a new script every seven days.<br>
</li><li>He says he&apos;s told his wife and a few writers about the ending of the entire series. He says that he&apos;s been told it&apos;s a disaster, but he&apos;s going with it.<br>
</li><li>Regarding the music in the show: everyone has Weiner&apos;s iPod, and access to his music list, and he says &quot;it really comes down to having an emotional response to a song. I have no rules about it. They do not have to be from the period.&quot;<br>
</li><li>When originally pitching the show, Weiner was rejected by various networks and was told a list of reasons: &quot;It&apos;s a period piece, it has smoking and drinking in it, it&apos;s too smart, only women will like it, it&apos;s too dirty/not dirty enough.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
