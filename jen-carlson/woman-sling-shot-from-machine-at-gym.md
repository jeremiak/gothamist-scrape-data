<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907225640/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07292008/news/regionalnews/woman_weight_lifted_122078.htm">The NY Post</a> sheds some light on the embarrassing incident today, reporting that &quot;a very large lady at the New York Sports Club was sling-shot off equipment known as the abductor&quot; (pictured). Gym members who looked on had this to say:</p><blockquote>&quot;She didn&apos;t close [the machine] properly. She was supposed to exit it from the side but tried to go over the leg bar . . and her loose pants got caught in the handle.&quot;<p></p>

<p>&quot;If you are on a machine, it&apos;s you versus the machine. She put too much weight on the machine. She was, like, sling-shot from it.&quot;</p></blockquote>To add insult to injury, the Post mentions several times the 38-year-old woman&apos;s &quot;portly&quot; stature, and adds that she had to be taken from the gym in a rescue basket, as a standard stretcher wouldn&apos;t do. There is currently no word on the woman&apos;s condition, who was taken to the New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center...but hopefully she&apos;s not reading the papers today.<p></p>
