<p>Remember last summer when Everclear, Gin Blossoms, Lit, Marcy Playground, and Sugar Ray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621205453/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/still_tix_left_for_thursdays_evercl.php">joined forces</a> to bring you <em>everything you ever wanted or needed in a concert experience</em>? Well they&apos;re doing it again, but this time they&apos;re doing it ON A CRUISE SHIP. </p>

<p>There will be some slight changes this time around, however&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621205453/http://markmcgrathandfriendscruise.com/">The Mark McGrath &amp; Friends Cruise</a> (omg) will not include Lit or Everclear (bad move, McGrath), but it will include sets from Sugar Ray, Smash Mouth, Gin Blossoms, Cracker, Spin Doctors, Vertical Horizon, The Verve Pipe, Marcy Playground, and acoustic performances from Ed Kowalcyzk of Live and Ed Roland of Collective Soul. </p>

<p>Where will the cruise take you&#x2014;aside from that blissful, nostalgic place that you hold tight in your heart space and pine for at night? On October 18th the ship will depart Miami and set sail for the Bahamas, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621205453/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mark-McGrath-Friends-Cruise/355405241221511">the Facebook page</a>, &quot;There will be live performances each night in the intimate Dynasty Lounge as well as live music every night in at least two different venues around the ship.&quot; You&apos;ll also get surprise unplugged sets, Q&amp;As;, dance parties, awkward moments at the buffet with Steve Harwell, and all of the below songs... which we&apos;re going to go listen to right now in our 1981 cherry red Plymouth Reliant K car that we rocked in high school:</p>
