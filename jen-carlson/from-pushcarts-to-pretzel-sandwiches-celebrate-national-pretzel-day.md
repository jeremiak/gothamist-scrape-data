</div></div><p>Today is National Pretzel Day&#x2014;the day we celebrate all shapes and sizes of the twisted snack. Below, our recommendations for where to get your fix, be it chocolate-dipped, salted, or <em>used as sandwich bread.</em></p>

<p>The ultimate place to celebrate today is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.sigmundnyc.com/photos.html"><strong>SIGMUND&apos;S</strong></a> on Avenue B. They have salted, seeded, and flavored pretzels ($3 to $3.50), as well as dips you can add on. A half dozen of the monstrous things will cost you $16, with a dozen going for $30. But then there&apos;s the pretzel <em>sandwich</em>. The shop slices one of their homebaked pretzels in half, stuffing it with things like mozzarella, tomato and pesto, or smoked salmon and dill cream cheese. And the savory meals are a sweet deal, too: they&apos;re only 7 bucks.</p>

<p>Some other suggestions from around Gothamist HQ:<br>
</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-redhead-new-york"><strong>THE RED HEAD</strong></a> on 13th and 1st serves up two soft pretzels with beer cheese for dipping, at $9 a plate.<br>
</li><li>Earlier this month we checked out the carboloaders at <strong>LANDBROT</strong>, a new German bakery and beer bar that has opened in the West Village and the Lower East Side. Check out their hot brezeln <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/beer_bread_flaming_pie_landbrot_ope.php#photo-5">right here</a>.<br>
</li><li>You can go to any bakery and get a chocolate-dipped pretzel&#x2014;those are pretty tough to mess up&#x2014;but the chocolate and caramel-covered pretzel rods at <strong>VARSANO&apos;S</strong> on West 4th really seems to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.yelp.com/biz/varsanos-chocolate-new-york">blowing people away</a>.<br>
</li><li>We remember mall pretzels being big a long time ago (you know, the kind dusted in sour cream and onion flavoring?), and the mall pretzel lives on... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.auntieannes.com/Products/Pretzels.aspx">at <strong>AUNTIE ANNE&apos;S</strong></a>. They have cinnamon sugar, jalapeno, and even pepperoni pretzels! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.yelp.com/biz/auntie-annes-brooklyn#query:pretzel">You can find one in Fort Greene, but there are </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://locator.auntieannes.com/">plenty around</a>.<br>
</li><li>For a fancier celebration of the pretzel, head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.davidburketownhouse.com/"><strong>DAVID BURKE TOWNHOUSE</strong></a> (on the Upper East Side or down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.yelp.com/biz/david-burke-kitchen-new-york">on Grand Street</a>) where they serve a (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20011069-10391704.html">rather healthy</a>) $18 pretzel-crusted crab cake (served with tomato-orange chutney and poppy seed honey).<br>
</li><li>And finally, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.taldebrooklyn.com/"><strong>TALDE</strong></a> in Park Slope has Pretzel Pork &amp; Chive Dumplings served with spicy mustard&#x2014;which you can see for yourself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529103814/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/6782768689/">here</a>.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>And let&apos;s not forget the iconic New York City pretzel cart. Soft pretzels have been sold on our streets since at least 1820, click through for a look back at the way they used to be sold on the streets&#x2014;from sticks, to pushcarts. And while you&apos;re out there today, don&apos;t forget to hydrate:</p>
