title: Ed Burns at The Delancey

										<p>Of all the actors with bands (Jared Leto, Adrian Grenier, Jason Schwartzman) we had our money on Ed Burns to be in a pretty rockin&apos; one. He recently played The Delancey with his band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161821/http://www.myspace.com/thebluejackets">The Blue Jackets</a>, and you can watch one of their songs from that night right here:</p>

<p align="center"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/a30OHUDs0r4"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161821oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/a30OHUDs0r4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></object>
</p><p>
Maybe it was just an off night. 

</p><p>The band also has a very New York video for &quot;Way Back Home&quot;, which can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161821/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3HiOUKBXeo">here</a>, not great - but better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161821/http://www.thirtysecondstomars.com/">30 Seconds to Mars</a>. The songs come across better when set to film (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161821/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455958/"><em>The Groomsmen</em></a>) then when performed live. Next show is in Ireland, but we bet they&apos;ll be back home in no time.</p>
