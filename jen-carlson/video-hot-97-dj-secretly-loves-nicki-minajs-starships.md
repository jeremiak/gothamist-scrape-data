title: Video: Hot 97 DJ Secretly Loves Nicki Minaj's "Starships"
---

<p>Like any good hip hop beef, the Nicki Minaj/Hot97 one <em>refuses to go away</em>, and it has now entered the parody phase. In the latest shot fired, deejay Peter Rosenberg releases a video of himself mocking the performer as he pretends to rock out to her latest single &quot;Starships.&quot; (We must warn you that if you choose to watch this with the volume up you will be subjected to the Minaj song in question, and it <em>will</em> get stuck in your head whether you like it or not. Also, you will not like it.)</p>

Rosenberg later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120614094029/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/07/dj_peter_rosenberg.php">told us</a> that Minaj could still &quot;go on to be the greatest female mc ever,&quot; and that she&apos;s &quot;inherently hip hop... it&apos;s just that &apos;Starships&apos; is definitely not.&quot; And who can argue with him?</p>
