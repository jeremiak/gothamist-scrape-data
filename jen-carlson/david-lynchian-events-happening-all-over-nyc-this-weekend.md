<p>Been feeling a little backwards and out of sorts lately? Maybe that&apos;s because there&apos;s so much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144712/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidlynch">David Lynch</a> in the air this month, with two events dedicated to the director/filmmaker/artist/coffee enthusiast. First up, the Museum of Moving Image is presenting an evening dedicated to Lynch&apos;s work: from transcendental meditation to <em>Eraserhead</em>.</p>

<p>This Saturday, October 13th (5-9 p.m.), they&apos;ll be screening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144712/http://www.movingimage.us/films/2012/10/13/detail/david-lynch-meditation-creativity-peace/"><em>Meditation, Creativity, Peace</em></a>, followed by a discussion, reception with donuts and coffee, and a rare screening of 35mm print of cult classic <em>Eraserhead</em>. Did we mention those damn fine donuts are from The Doughnut Plant? Tickets are included with museum admission on Saturday. We&apos;re told Lynch won&apos;t be in attendance, but people from the David Lynch Foundation will be.</p>

<p>If you need a little hair of the dog on Sunday, there&apos;s another Lynch event happening, this one at Le Poisson Rouge, where they&apos;re bringing back &quot;Silencio: A Tribute to the Works of David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti.&quot; Tickets to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144712/http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/artist/4682">the Lynch-inspired band</a> are 20 bucks, but for $700 you can get the VIP package, which includes a table for four and a new Limited Edition Dom P&#xE9;rignon by (and signed by) David Lynch. Or you can just get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144712/http://www.bevmo.com/Shop/ProductDetail.aspx?productid=2066">a bottle of Andre</a> and watch this interview with Badalamenti over and over again:</p>
