title: John Mayer is Funny, Again
---

	
										<p>Sure, there are probably a few jokes <em>about</em> John Mayer, but last year John Mayer himself decided to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120214859/http://www.stereogum.com/archives/002777.html">hit the comedy circuit</a>, and now it looks like he&apos;s kicking off 2007 with a little bit of funny as well. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120214859/http://varsitybasketweaving.com/2007/01/10-things-john-mayer-did-during-his-jan.html">Varsity Basketweaving caught his set</a> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120214859/http://www.comedycellar.com/">Comedy Cellar</a> on January 5th. Here are some of  the &quot;10 things John Mayer did during his Jan. 5 stand-up set at the Comedy Cellar&quot; after crashing the 11:30pm set (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120214859/http://www.theapiary.org/archives/2007/01/john_mayer_retu.html">The Apiary</a>): </p>

<blockquote>2. Wore standard stand-up fare: dark sweater and jeans.
<p>
3. Admitted &quot;Yeah, I&apos;m the &apos;Daughters&apos; guy,&quot; then proceeded to sing amusing alternate lyrics to the song with that distinctive Mayer lilt.
</p><p>
8. Avoided any mention of Jessica Simpson. (Draw your own conclusions.)
</p><p>
9. Checked his Blackberry to see if he forgot any jokes. Made fun of himself for doing so.
</p><p>
10. Made the audience laugh consistently during his set of about 10 minutes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&apos;s Mayer on Chappelle&apos;s show (also starring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120214859/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3Fuestlove">?uestlove</a>):<br>

From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160120214859/http://www.johnmayer.com/blog">Mayer&apos;s blog</a>: &quot;I did come close to &apos;good&apos; at comedy this time around, but I had to settle for &quot;actually not bad!&quot; a few times.&quot;</p>
