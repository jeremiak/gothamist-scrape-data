The truck&#x2014;which had the street artist&apos;s 1-800 number on it&#x2014;was spotted around South Brooklyn yesterday afternoon&#x2014;around 1 p.m. a tipster had told us, &quot;It was so loud. Not sure but i think someone was in the truck banging as if the animals were trying to escape.&quot; Disturbing indeed&#x2014;he calls the piece The Sirens Of The Lambs. Here&apos;s video from when it was first spotted yesterday:</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150511041123if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/76631729?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="640" height="361" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>As of 11 a.m. today the &quot;slaughterhouse delivery truck [is] touring the meatpacking district,&quot; and then will tour citywide. We&apos;re headed over there now to see if we can spot it, and will update with specific current locations. In the meantime, here&apos;s the video Banksy posted on his YouTube today, showing some reactions to the truck:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150511041123if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/WDIz7mEJOeA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>And don&apos;t try tossing any tracking devices inside, as someone seems to have done with the mysterious street artist&apos;s other moving target (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511041123/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/photos_video_banksys_enchanting_mob.php#photo-1">the waterfall and butterfly truck</a>)&#x2014;with his latest update he added this addendum: &quot;If you&apos;re the person who stuck a tracking device on the garden truck you&apos;re now following a car service in Queens.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update 3 p.m.</b>: We visited the truck at Little West 12th Street by Washington Street and we asked the truck driver his name. He replied, &quot;Joe.&quot; Last name? &quot;The Farmer.&quot; Joe The Farmer couldn&apos;t really answer any of our other questions, &quot;I don&apos;t really know much, I&apos;m just a driver, a delivery guy. I&apos;m just here delivering meat. Farm fresh meat.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150511041123if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/76721078" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150511041123if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/76721077" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>He did admit that he didn&apos;t know where he was going next, &quot;I just find out along the away.&quot;</p>
