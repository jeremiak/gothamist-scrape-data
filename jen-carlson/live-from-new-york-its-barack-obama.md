title: Live From New York...It's Barack Obama!
---

	
										<p>Last night, during the Brian Williams-hosted and Feist-soundtracked Saturday Night Live, the show opened with a scene from Chappaqua, New York. All of the Democrats were there to celebrate Halloween, and who was under the Barack Obama mask...</p>

<p>...but Barack himself! The rest of the democrats were all played by SNL cast members, though it would have been interesting to have seen them all playing themselves. As a sidenote: Brian Williams did a pretty good job hosting, he&apos;s actually a better actor than some of the real actors that have hosted. Newsweek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426234255/http://www.newsweek.com/id/57335">ran an article</a> recently on comedians&apos; difficulty--Amy Poehler in particular--nailing a good imitation of Hillary Clinton. We actually think Poehler&apos;s pretty good, but it&apos;s an interesting note on how Hillary lacks any of the salient personal characteristics of her husband.</p>
