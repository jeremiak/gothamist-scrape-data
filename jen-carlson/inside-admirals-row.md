</div></div>					<p>This past weekend our very own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://bluejake.com/">Jake Dobkin</a> infiltrated the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/05/inside_the_brooklyn_navy_yard.php">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> once again, this time hitting up Admiral&apos;s Row. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://www.officersrow.org/">Officer&#x2019;s Row</a>, the authority on the area, the &quot;small section of the Brooklyn Navy Yard was home to high-ranking officers and their families. The ten houses (six buildings) were built between 1864 and 1901. Surrounded by a high brick wall and iron gates, Officer&apos;s Row was a small piece of beauty amidst a bustling industrial neighborhood. It housed tennis courts, a stable-turned ice skating rink, and parade grounds. Several varieties of fruit trees and a communal vegetable garden could be found dotting the landscape.&quot; (Here are some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://www.bluejake.com/archives/2008/02/22/admirals_row_in_winter.php">exterior shots</a>.)</p>

<p>When the Navy Yard was signed over to the city in 2001 this was the one area that was kept under the Army Corps of Engineers jurisdiction (here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://www.nan.usace.army.mil/business/buslinks/admiral/index.htm">Federal government&apos;s Admiral&apos;s Row review site</a>). Now preservationists are fighting to keep the homes standing, as developers plan for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/08/20/another_admirals_row_alternative_revealed.php">a supermarket</a> to take over the site. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090104/SMALLBIZ/901039990/0/keywords">Crain&apos;s</a> recently reported that &quot;After 20 years of debate and controversy, the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corp. expects to issue a request for proposals for the six-acre site housing Admiral&apos;s Row&#x2014;10 historic but crumbling residences more than a century old&#x2014;by as early as February.&quot; Stay tuned as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202412/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/30/31_30_admirals_debate.html">the battle lines</a> continue to form and the fate of the area is decided upon.</p>
