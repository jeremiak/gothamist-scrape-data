<p>Man on the street Jim Kiernan tells us that Kenny Scharf finished <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504040549/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/29/kenny_scharf_mural_goes_up_on_houst.php">his mural</a> last night, a full day ahead of schedule. Maybe he read the forecast, or wanted to get an earlier flight out to Art Basel in Miami. ANYWAY, it&apos;s done... and Kiernan reminds us that the only other artist to ever paint this wall all on his own was Keith Haring. All in all it took Scharf 100 hours, spread apart over six days&#x2014;and he did it all without a sketch.</p>

<p>Now, stay tuned for the inevitable photos of the mural getting bombed...</p>
