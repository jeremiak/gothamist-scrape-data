<p>In the below video, Jimmy Kimmel addresses the &quot;rivalry&quot; between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042017/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/02/it_happens.php">New Yorkers and Angelenos</a>. Is there a rivalry? Isn&apos;t it just that some people live here and then get sad when all of their friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042017/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/nyc_vs_la_which_better.php">move there</a> and live in bungalows and are able to replenish their vitamin D year-round? </p>

<p>Anyway, Kimmel talked to locals from both cities, and we have learned a few things from his efforts: every New Yorker thinks that everyone in LA eats avocados and talks like they&apos;re in the 1983 classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042017/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSX4YgdKKMk"><em>Valley Girl</em></a>. And everyone in LA thinks everyone in New York orders Chinese food at 4 a.m. and talks like they&apos;re in the 1987 classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030042017/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M01_2CKL6PU"><em>Moonstruck</em></a>. We are all tied together by Nic Cage. As it should be.</p>
