<span class="photo_caption">Zoltar at Coney Island (photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035324/http://www.flickr.com/photos/denoswonderwheelpark/sets/72157626532747044/with/5634799364/">Deno&apos;s Wonder Wheel Park</a>) vs. the real Zoltar in Big.</span></p>

<p>Zoltar, who you know from his small yet important role in <em>Big</em>, has arrived at Coney Island! At least, some sort of distant relative of his has. We&apos;re told this version of Zoltar is currently living <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035324/http://www.coneyislandfunguide.com/Attraction/Denos-Wonder-Wheel-Amusement-Park.htm">under the Wonder Wheel</a> beside Grandma&apos;s Predictions, and that &quot;they are already close friends!&quot; </p>

<p>In the movie, the Zoltar scene (in which Josh fatefully tells the machine he wants to be an adult) was shot at nearby Rye Playland, but last year when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505035324/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=3255">ScoutingNY</a> went to the spot he found it was replaced with a Pepsi machine. So where is the real deal?</p>

<p>This Coney Island version is definitely not the <em>real</em> Zoltar, as you can see in the photo comparison above. Here&apos;s what a more accurate Zoltar machine would look like in action:</p>

<p>If you visit the Coney Island one, send us some video... and be careful what you wish for!</p>
