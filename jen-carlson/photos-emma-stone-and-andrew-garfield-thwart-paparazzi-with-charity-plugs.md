<p>Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield (yes, Gwen Stacy and Spidey are dating IRL) were followed by paparazzi all over New York City this past Saturday, but instead of scowling or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175209/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/19/alec_baldwin_punches_photographer_c.php">throwing punches</a>, the couple created some homemade signs to help raise awareness for the Worldwide Orphans Foundation and Gilda&#x2019;s Club. The signs read:</p><blockquote>&quot;We just found out that there are paparazzi outside the restaurant we were eating in. So... why not take this opportunity to bring attention to organizations that need and deserve it? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175209/http://www.WWO.org/">www.WWO.org</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175209/http://www.GildasClubNYC.org/">www.GildasClubNYC.org</a> &#x2014; Have a great day!&quot;</blockquote>Other celebrities take note&#x2014;even if you&apos;re the less charitable type, you could at least use the same stunt to promote your Twitter handle or ask why the paparazzi and public <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175209/https://twitter.com/lindsaylohan/status/247537223652757505">aren&apos;t hounding that other fallen actress who also crashed cars</a>!<p></p>
