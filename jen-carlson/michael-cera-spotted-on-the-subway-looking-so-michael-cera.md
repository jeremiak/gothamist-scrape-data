<p>Isn&apos;t this photo of Michael Cera on the subway <em>exactly</em> what you would picture if you were asked for some reason to imagine Michael Cera on the subway? A tipster tells us this shot was taken last night on the Q train around 7 p.m.&#x2014;&quot;He got on in Brooklyn and got off at Canal.&quot; </p>

<p>You can&apos;t see it in this photo, but it&apos;s safe to assume there was at least one adorkable young woman with pixie hair, thigh-high socks and ironic granny glasses sitting across from Cera with her face pressed into a Kindle as she pretended not to stare at the <em>Nick and Norah&apos;s Infinite Playlist</em> star. It&apos;s unclear if Cera rolls with human props like this to keep his Cera levels dialed up to 11, or if the moment was as pure and serendipitous as Cera himself.</p>

<p>If this subway car had been the Internet, the moment may have been ruined as Cera was bombarded with questions about a possible <em>Arrested Development</em> movie, but IRL not one person asked him about a thing. Not <em>one</em> thing.  The actor was just down in Austin launching his new YouTube network, Jash, which he is running with Sarah Silverman, Reggie Watts, Tim Heidecker, and Eric Wareheim.</p>
