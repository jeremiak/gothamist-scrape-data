<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpcrBGrLAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193549im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpcrBGrLAM.jpg" width="200" height="256" class="image-right"> </span>Constance McMillen, the Mississippi teen banished from her school&apos;s prom for wanting to bring a girl (she&apos;s been out as a lesbian her entire high school career), has garnered national attention for Itawamba Agricultural High School. The school was sued by the ACLU and they canceled the prom... or so everyone thought. She was actually sent to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193549/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/04/05/ACLU_Investigating_Fake_Prom/">a decoy prom</a> attended by 7 other people, while the rest of her senior class had a real prom at a secret location. Now NYC is welcoming the teen with open arms: she&apos;s been named the grand marshal of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193549/http://gothamist.com/tags/gayprideparade">Gay Pride Parade</a> this year!</p>

<p>The Heritage of Pride organization, which runs the parade, recently announced the news, which was confirmed by McMillen&apos;s lawyer, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193549/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/unwelcome-at-prom-but-leading-pride-parade/">the NY Times</a>. The parade will be held on June 27th this year, and prior to that McMillen will be attending a prom in San Francisco organized by the National Center for Lesbian Rights.</p>

<p>While both coasts are embracing her, she&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193549/http://jezebel.com/5511735/lesbian-teen-mocked-by-classmates-on-facebook">still being ridiculed</a> by classmates, who have even started a Facebook page called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193549/http://www.facebook.com/pages/Constance-quit-yer-cryin/367776042862">Constance quit yer cryin</a>.</p>
