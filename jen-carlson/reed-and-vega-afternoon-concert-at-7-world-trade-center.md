As we all know, 7 WTC is the only tower to be rebuilt since 9/11; the plaza already opened this week.</p>

<p>The first tenants (the developers of the building - Silverstein Properties) will move in Friday, followed by the architects (Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel and Richard Rogers) working on the three buildings being designed for Church Street.  Still, there are at least 30 floors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811150235/http://silversteinproperties.com/inner_page.aspx?id=5">still available for lease at 7 WTC</a>.</p>

<p>First, however, Reed and Vega will christen the area with some rock. The show will start around noon at Vesey and Greenwich Streets, just after after the 11:30am dedication ceremony (we didn&apos;t even know Lou Reed got up this early). This ceremony will include and unveiling of the a statue and fountain at the plaza. Joining the two headliners will be an array of musicians from just about every genre (rock, opera, reggae, jazz) and fifth grade students from P.S. 89 and P.S. 234. Amongst the roster are some of our favorites: Citizen Cope and Brazilian Girls. So if you&apos;re downtown tomorrow, brown bag it and enjoy a lunchtime concert! </p>
