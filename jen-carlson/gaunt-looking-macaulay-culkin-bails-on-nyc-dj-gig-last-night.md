<p>This week some new photos of Macaulay Culkin surfaced, showing a much more frail version of the actor than we&apos;ve seen in the past. So naturally, eyes were on Le Poisson Rouge last night, where the actor hosts his monthly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070702/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/are_you_ready_to_dance_with_macaula.php">Macaulay Culkin&apos;s iPod</a> nights on Thursdays, but he was a no-show. </p>

<p>The sign at the club read: &quot;Macaulay Culkin&apos;s iPod is now Macaulay Culkin&apos;s Food Drive. No Mack tonight, but the iPod has arrived!&quot; A club employee told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070702/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20569122,00.html">People</a>, &quot;He&apos;s here all the time. He comes pretty often. Tonight, something just came up and he couldn&apos;t make it. But he did drop off his iPod&#x2014;that&apos;s what&apos;s playing. It&apos;s a shame he&apos;s not here, because he always plays really good music.&quot; </p>

<p>His rep claims, &quot;Macaulay Culkin is in perfectly good health. For anyone to speculate or suggest otherwise is reckless, irresponsible and destructive. The massive media attention towards the status of Mr. Culkin&apos;s health is unnecessary but duly noted.&quot; So maybe he&apos;s just doing some <em>meth</em>od acting?</p>

<p>And now, we leave you with CBS&apos;s touching tribute to the actor&apos;s appearance, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070702/http://www.cbsnews.com/2300-207_162-10011269.html?tag=page">Macaulay Culkin Throughout The Years: A Slideshow</a>.</p>
