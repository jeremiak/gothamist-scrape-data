</div></div><p>Over the weekend, animals of all kinds headed to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063040/http://www.stjohndivine.org/">Cathedral of St. John the Divine</a> for the annual animal blessing, which marked the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi. Seems like there were a few familiar faces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063040/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/08/pet_blessing.php">from last year</a> (we&apos;re lookin&apos; at you, camel), as well as some newbies. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063040/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/node/56068">The Columbia Spectator</a> was on hand, and reports that the room was filled with yelps and barks as Reverend James Kowalski delivered the sermon to the pack of unusual churchgoers--there was even a yak and a caribou reindeer!</p>
