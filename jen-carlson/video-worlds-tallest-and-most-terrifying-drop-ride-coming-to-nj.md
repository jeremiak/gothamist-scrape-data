<p>As Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey sends its wooden Rolling Thunder roller coaster to the woodchipper, it makes way for a new ride: the Zumanjaro Drop Of Doom. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071149/http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2013/08/great_adventure_to_build_worlds_largest_drop_ride.html#incart_m-rpt-1">to NJ.com</a> the ride will bring the passenger up 415 feet before dropping them straight down at 80 MPH <em>as a roller coaster loops around them</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071149/http://austinist.com/2013/07/20/woman_falls_to_death_from_six_flags.php">Hopefully safety measures</a> will be taken to a new Insanely Protective And Worried Mother Who Has An OCD-Level Tendency To Doublecheck Locks&quot; level.</p>

<p>About that added roller coaster feature&#x2014;the park&apos;s Kingda Ka will &quot;hurl toward riders on Zumanjaro at speeds up to 128 mph. Its three, 41-story towers will be built on the face of the roller coaster.&quot; This will all be complete by next year. Meanwhile, Six Flags Great America is building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071149/http://chicagoist.com/2013/08/29/six_flags_great_america_building_wo.php#photo-1">the world&#x2019;s most extreme wooden roller coaster</a>, which looks a lot like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071149/http://austinist.com/2013/07/20/woman_falls_to_death_from_six_flags.php">the Texas Giant</a>.</p>

<p>Office daredevil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071149/http://twitter.com/nellcasey">Nell Casey</a> reacted as such: &quot;They&apos;re building it INSIDE Kingda Ka, which I will NEVER EVER GO ON because they don&apos;t run it when it&apos;s windy. Terrifying.&quot; Still, not as scary as anything <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071149/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/the_legend_of_the_most_dangerous_ac.php">at Action Park</a> though.</p>
