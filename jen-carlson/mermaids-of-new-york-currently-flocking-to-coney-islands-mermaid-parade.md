Photos are already coming in from the frontlines... or at least, the underground, where mermaids have taken over the subways. Don&apos;t forget to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150216154523/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos, or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr! <p></p>

<p>In the meantime, check out the trailer for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150216154523/http://mermaidsofnewyork.com/"><em>Mermaids of New York</em></a>, a documentary about &quot;the truly amazing, beautiful and genuine mermaids that live on and around the island of Manhattan&quot; (who knew?!). It will be screening next month at: <br>
</p><ul><li>July 7th, 6:30 p.m. at Happy Hour Fundraiser at R-Bar in Manhattan<br>
</li><li>July 21st, 8 p.m. at Sirens and Society: Post-Modern Mermaidia at Observatory in Brooklyn</li></ul><p></p>

<p>So when do you think they&apos;ll remake <em>Splash</em>?</p>
