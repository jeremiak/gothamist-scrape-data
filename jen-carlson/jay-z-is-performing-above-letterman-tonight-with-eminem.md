<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708170227/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/18/jay-zs_free_show_canceled_after_sea.php">Last week</a> word was that Jay-Z&apos;s performance tonight atop the marquee of the Ed Sullivan Theater got canceled because of concerns that things may get a little out of control. This announcement came just days after rapper Drake was scheduled to play a free show at the South Street Seaport, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708170227/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/17/police_commish_blames_organizers_fo.php">ended in a riot</a> before the first note even got played. But it looks like Jay-Z&apos;s camp, and the city, may have pulled an ol&apos; switcharoo on us, because right now both Jay-Z and Eminem are rehearsing on top of Letterman&apos;s studio. </p>

We&apos;re told you can&apos;t see <em>or</em> hear anything from street level, but that they may be letting some fans (Letterman audience members?) up for the performance, which will take place later.</p>
