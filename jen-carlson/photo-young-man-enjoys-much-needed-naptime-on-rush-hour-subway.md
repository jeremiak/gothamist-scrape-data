<p>Laying down across the subway seats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003835/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">is Wrong</a>... but sometimes you just fall asleep, and your body loses its ability to sit up, and you pass out, and a warm stranger&apos;s shoulder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003835/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/photo_stranger_asleep_on_orthodox_m.php">isn&apos;t there to catch you</a>, and you ruined all of your relationships and don&apos;t have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003835/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/photo_if_you_must_sleep_on_the_subw.php">a warm lap to fall in to</a>&#x2014;not now, and probably not ever. And someone takes your photo, and you end up <em>here</em>.</p>

<p>Last night during rush hour this young, tuckered-out man was spotted on the uptown 5 train. A witness to this conduct, Emily Laskodi, tells us he was in full-on REM sleep-mode, breathing out of his mouth, and was out for her entire 15 minutes on the train, from Fulton to Grand Central Terminal. For all we know, the guy went full Rip Van Winkle and is still sawing wood for tonight&apos;s commute. Let us know if you see him...</p>
