Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201651/http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2008/52952/">NYMag</a> names Ditmas Park one of their many reasons to love our fair city. Why? Because it&apos;s our own tiny version of the City by the Bay. The mag says, &quot;What New Yorker with a repressed slacker-hippie side hasn&#x2019;t fantasized about ditching Gotham for calmer, quainter San Francisco? Some locals have been satisfying that yen by simply moving to Ditmas Park, the Victorian-packed enclave south of Prospect Park. It isn&#x2019;t just that the West Coast metropolis and the west-of-Flatbush hamlet share an abundance of turn-of-the-century painted ladies.&quot; And those painted ladies will cost you just about as much as the ones on the West Coast, now well over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201651/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/reb/958952817.html">a million bucks</a>. But that&apos;s the price you pay to live near bookstores, drum circles, and a laid-back SF vibe, man. One local told them: <strong>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a bunch of communists hanging out and drinking Fair Trade coffee while reading conspiracy books.&quot;</strong></p>
