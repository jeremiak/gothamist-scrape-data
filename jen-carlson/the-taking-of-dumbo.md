Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504040538/http://justjared.buzznet.com/2008/04/28/denzel-washington-pelham-123">shooting has commenced</a>, and today Denzel Washington &amp; Co. can be found in DUMBO. Unless, of course, this <em>is</em> a set for <em>The <strong>Talking</strong> of <strong>Telham</strong> 123</em>, as the sign suggests -- in which case, don&apos;t expect to spot John Travolta in the &apos;nabe.</p>

<p>The movie will be out in time for the summer screens next year, with a release date of July 31st, 2009.</p>
