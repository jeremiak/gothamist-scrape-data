</div></div>					<p>Jonathan Butler, the man behind Brownstoner and a founder of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509235755/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynflea">Brooklyn Flea</a>, has entered the real estate racket, opening a creative complex&#x2014;read: offices&#x2014;in Crown Heights called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509235755/http://www.1000dean.com/">1000 Dean</a>. A number of others are involved in the project as well, including unusual bedfellows Goldman Sachs and 3rd Ward (the Bushwick-based party and education hub). The big draw: the office space will be anchored by a massive food and beer hall. </p>

<p>We dropped by the buildings, which are still going through renovations, a couple of weeks ago (click through for your construction porn), and Butler told us a little about how it all came to be. &quot;The development is a joint venture between me and BFC Development and Goldman Sachs that I put together two years ago, after becoming convinced that this small industrial area in the midst of so many booming residential neighborhoods was an ideal place to create a hub for the many creative entrepreneurs that live within biking distance of 1000 Dean. In the meantime, Franklin Avenue has undergone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509235755/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/video_crown_heights_locals_react_to.php">a pretty dramatic renaissance</a> that has underscored the commercial potential of Crown Heights North.&quot;</p>

<p>The building itself is from 1920, built originally &quot;as a service station for Dodge and Plymouth cars and trucks. In the 1940s it became the Studebaker Service Station and by the late 1950s it became a furniture warehouse.&quot; In the 1980s, things got way less interesting and it became a storage space.</p>

<p>In its latest incarnation, it will serve primarily as a creative hub&#x2014;Butler tells us the &quot;upper three floors will be creative office space, with units as small as 700-square-feet and lease terms as short as 1 year. It&apos;s the only building of this type and size in the area.&quot; And then there&apos;s the business of the food, and the beer. </p>

<p>&quot;The 3rd Ward food incubator is on the ground floor of the Studebaker building and the Brooklyn Flea beer hall is in a one story building attached. The beer hall will feature four of the Flea&apos;s most popular food vendors and serve as a dining hall and meeting place for the office building as well as the neighborhood.&quot; </p>

<p>The beer hall and the food incubator are slated to open in 2014, and Butler is expecting office occupancy as early as October (they just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509235755/http://www.aptsandlofts.com/rentals/1000-dean-street-unit-varies-brooklyn-ny-11238">started leasing spaces</a> last week).</p>
