<p>NYC has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154403/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/happy_margarita_day_our_staff_picks.php">some great margaritas</a>, from cheap and loaded with grain alcohol, to pink and frozen. But we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154403/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/11/how_to_do_sxsw_in_nyc.php#photo-2">yet to master</a> the avocado marg&#x2014;an important part of SXSW, which just kicked off today.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154403/https://www.currasgrill.com/">Curra&#x2019;s Grill</a> in Austin serves up the best version of these IN THE WORLD&#x2014;a thick and creamy concoction which is the best chaser to a long day at South By, or anywhere else. But just because you aren&apos;t there, doesn&apos;t mean you need to be deprived&#x2014;you too can indulge in this magic.</p>

<p>Even if you are skeptical of mixing tequila with omega-3 fatty acids, we urge you try this recipe, which Brian Schikevitz, veteran bartender at Curra&#x2019;s, has shared with us.</p>
