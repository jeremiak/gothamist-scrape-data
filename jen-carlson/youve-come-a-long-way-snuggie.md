</div></div><p>Earlier today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522094459/http://gothamist.com/tags/snuggie">Snuggie</a> and Fashion Week collided, as the sleeved blankets took the runway at the Snuggie fall 2009/winter 2010 collection show. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522094459/http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2009/09/snuggie_to_hold_sexy_fashion_s.html">invite</a> read that it would &quot;showcase the latest colors, fabrics and patterns&quot; and feature &quot;the sexiest looks in blanket-wear,&quot; for not only adults, but kids and canines as well. (Sadly, it doesn&apos;t look like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522094459/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xeu3fX6xLk4">the SnugWow</a> was featured.)</p>

<p>While Anna Wintour didn&apos;t seem to make it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522094459/http://www.zannel.com/viewupdate.htm?id=BAIT4">these 12 other people did</a>! Sure attendance was low, but the show did get a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522094459/http://search.twitter.com/search?q=snuggie+fashion">sexy Twitter action</a>, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522094459/http://twitter.com/stacilucash/statuses/4008394939">one wanna-be</a> fashionista&apos;s opinion that &quot;Snuggie is a disgrace to Fashion Week.&quot; Oh, c&apos;mon, hating on Snuggies is like hating on puppies!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We hear these styles are already on shelves in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond&#x2014;is this the first collection that&apos;s ever gone from &quot;off the rack&quot; to Fashion Week?</p>
