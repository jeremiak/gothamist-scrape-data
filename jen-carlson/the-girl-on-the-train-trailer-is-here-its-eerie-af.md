<p>The Paula Hawkins novel <em>The Girl on the Train</em> is coming to the big screen, and the adaptation has brought the characters out of the UK and into the U.S.&#x2014;to New York, specifically. While the novel certainly fit in the <em>Gone Girl</em> genre, the movie seems to have gone full throttle in that direction. The newly released trailer gives a first look at the film, and shows a much darker world than I pictured while reading the book last year. </p>

<p>Filming took place in NYC, Hastings-on-the-Hudson, White Plains, and Irvington last year, and in the trailer we see Emily Blunt&apos;s character Rachel roaming the crime-scene-coated suburbs, Grand Central, and devouring martinis in the Oyster Bar. Every shot has an eerie, unsettled nature to it. </p>

<p>The movie comes out this October.</p>
