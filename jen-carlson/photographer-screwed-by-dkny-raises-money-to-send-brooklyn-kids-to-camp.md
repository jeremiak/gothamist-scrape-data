<span class="photo_caption">DKNY&apos;s window display, and Stanton&apos;s original photo</span></p>

<p>When DKNY used street photographer Brandon Stanton&apos;s photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428203313/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/dkny_uses_photographers_images_with.php">without permission or compensation</a>, Stanton called them out on it. Originally, the company had offered Stanton&#x2014;who runs the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428203313/http://www.humansofnewyork.com/">Humans of New York</a> site&#x2014;$15,000 for 300 of his photographs, which they wanted to use for window displays. Stanton declined, but that didn&apos;t stop DKNY from using his images anyway&#x2014;and when he found out, he only asked that they donate $100,000 to the YMCA in Bed-Stuy. The company eventually offered a $25,000 donation. So now, Stanton is trying to raise the remaining $75,000 via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428203313/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/346367">this Indiegogo campaign</a>. This morning he told us over email, &quot;HONY&apos;s audience has stepped up to raise the $75K shortfall between DKNY&apos;s $25K donation and the full $100K requested. In less than 24 hours, we&apos;ve already passed their donation.&quot;</p>

<p>In the message he posted on the fundraising platform, Stanton writes that if the money is raised it would &quot;send a full 300 kids to summer camp for two weeks.  Can you imagine the impact that would have? In some neighborhoods, the YMCA plays a critical role of stability and community.  My neighborhood is one of those neighborhoods.&quot;</p>

<p>Now the question is, will DKNY step up and match the donations?</p>
