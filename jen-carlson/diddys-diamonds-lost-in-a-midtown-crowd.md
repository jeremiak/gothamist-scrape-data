                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpdIRxcUAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140131215603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpdIRxcUAM.jpg" width="275" height="275" class="image-right"> </span>Uh oh, what did Diddy do now. The rapper accidentally tossed one of his diamond rings into a crowd while performing for BET&apos;s 106 &amp; Park show (filmed on 57th Street), and ended the performance with a frisking of audience members! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140131215603/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/diddy_lo_es_in_ring_toss_LVi1R8PdbTgxAnl63Z38SP">The Post</a> reports that attendees were treated &quot;like common criminals&quot; once the cameras cut &#x2014; and they took their grievances to Twitter to kill time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140131215603/http://twitter.com/PWillzNYC/status/4848790512">one saying</a>: &quot;<strong>Ok diddy lost his ring... and now there frisking all the kids like this is Rikers lite.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Once the hostage situation ended, the $20,000 ring was nowhere to be found. One witness told the paper, &quot;He ain&apos;t getting&apos; it back. Someone pocketed that, and they probably took it to the nearest jeweler.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident happened when Diddy &amp; Co. were throwing fake hundreds into the crowd, and then mixed in some real cash... which allegedly sent fans into a frenzy (even though it was reportedly just &quot;$25 to $100 in singles&quot;). Following the bling bonanza, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140131215603/http://twitter.com/iamdiddy/status/4852727925">the rapper Twote</a>: &quot;The craziest shit just happened to me lol <strong>I guess its shittin on me season.. Enjoy it while it lasts!!!!!</strong> lol life is crazy!&quot;</p>
