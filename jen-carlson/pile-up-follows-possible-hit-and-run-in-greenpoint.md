<p>An alert came over the newswire not long ago regarding an accident investigation at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429135207/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=Manhattan+Avenue+and+India+Street+brooklyn&amp;ll=40.732836,-73.954618&amp;spn=0.008179,0.016973&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Manhattan Avenue and India Street</a> in Greenpoint, where at least one victim has been transported to Bellevue Hospital. A reader has just sent in the above photo, and we&apos;re hearing rumors that &quot;the driver of one of the vehicles struck a woman on Huron Street and was fleeing the scene, and caused this pile up. From what the police were saying, it appears that the woman in critical condition at this scene was an occupant of one of the cars on the bottom of the pile.&quot;</p>
