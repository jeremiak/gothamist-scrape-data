<span class="photo_caption">How much would you pay for free Jon Bon Jovi tickets? <em>This</em> much?</span></p>

<p>As the big Bon Jovi concert approaches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015321/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/03/bon_jovi_ticket_bonanaza.php">tickets to the free show</a> are going for as much as $1500/pair, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015321/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07082008/news/regionalnews/lawn_sharks_selling_free_jovi_tix_for_75_118912.htm">The NY Post</a> reports. The show is going down this Saturday on the Great Lawn in Central Park, and an additional lot of tickets will be released at the Javits Center this Friday (more details at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015321/http://MLB.com/">MLB.com</a>). Hardcore fans of Jon Bon who don&apos;t get their hands on the freebies will have to lay down some serious cash via online outlets like eBay and Craigslist.</p><blockquote>An eBay search at midday yesterday found 267 listings for the sold-out concert, with prices ranging from 99 cents to $1,500 a pair from one especially audacious seller identified as &quot;agttickets.&quot;</blockquote>So far 60,000 tickets are in the hands of fans (or scalpers). A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015321/http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=bon%20jovi">search on Craigslist</a> today shows a number of non-specific listings, mostly asking for &quot;best offers.&quot; One scalper, who allegedly has 49 tickets to give away (even though there was a limit to 2 per person), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015321/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tix/747090057.html">claims</a> they will only go to the die hard fans who meet him the day of the show (he&apos;ll be wearing a blue sweatshirt by the E 72nd Street entrance at 2 p.m.!). <p></p>

<p>Matt Bourne, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, told the Post that those who purchase their tickets on the internet might not get in, as the ticket&apos;s fine print says as much. It&apos;s unclear how this would be regulated especially with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805015321/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/03/23/2007-03-23_pols_got_big_bux_from_tix_sellers-1.html">the legislation</a> signed by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer allowing tickets to be scalped online. </p>
