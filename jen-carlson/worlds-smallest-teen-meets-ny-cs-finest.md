<p>The World&#x2019;s Smallest Teen, 17-year-old Khagendra Thapa Magar from Nepal, is in the big city to fulfill some of his dreams. The 22-inch-tall teenager (who weighs just 10 lbs) will be here today and tomorrow, and plans to visit Katz&apos;s Deli, the Empire State Building, and Ripley&#x2019;s Museum, where we&apos;re told he will &quot;come face-to-shin with a life-sized figure of Robert Wadlow, the world&#x2019;s tallest man ever.&quot; Wadlow was 8&#x2019; 11&#x201D;, and also made a visit to the Empire State Building... back in 1937.</p>
