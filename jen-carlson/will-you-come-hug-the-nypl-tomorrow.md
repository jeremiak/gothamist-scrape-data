Schwarzman Building may be made of stone, but that doesn&apos;t mean it couldn&apos;t use a hug, right? Tomorrow the group Urban Librarians Unite is planning to do just that&#x2014;they&apos;re holding a &quot;hug the library&quot; event! <p></p>

<p>Their public show of affection is meant &quot;to call attention to the potentially devastating budget cuts being proposed by the city.&quot; The NYPL, for example, is facing a $40 million proposed cut. If you want to show your love, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024511/https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=128218867258005&amp;ref=nf">be there by 2 p.m.</a> and join hundreds of library supporters who plan to surround the landmark and give it a great big hug. And don&apos;t forget to pat the lions on the head, while you&apos;re at it.</p>

<p>If you can&apos;t make it, or are just anti-PDA, you can send a letter to your city councilmembers instead&#x2014;take action <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024511/http://takeaction.nypl.org/">here</a>!</p>
