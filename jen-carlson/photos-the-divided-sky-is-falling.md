                            <p>Did your office just turn dark? Did your Instagram just fill up with apocalyptic-looking sky photos? Did you feel a dark shadow creep over your shoulders as if the Grim Reaper himself were going in for the hug? WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE?</p>

<p>There&apos;s currently a tornado watch for New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005331/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/07/watch_out_for_tornadoes_today.php">until 5 p.m.</a>, and the giant green band on this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005331/http://www.weather.com/weather/map/interactive/Brooklyn+NY+11231:4:US">satellite weather map</a> is on top of us which&#x2014;if our eyes are to be believed&#x2014;means a lot of rain. And a lot of gray skies. To be honest guys, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005331/http://www.weather.com/news/government-shutdown-effects-weather-20130930">NOAA is running on fumes</a> due to the government shutdown so who the fuck knows what&apos;s really going on. Have a drink.</p>

<p>When reached for comment about the current weather situation, our go-to weather guy Joe Schumacher told us, &quot;Tornadoes are far from my mind. I&apos;m sitting on a park bench in Asheville, paralyzed with indecision over what brewpub to have lunch at.&quot; Thanks Joe, pour one out for us?</p>

<p>So listen to this sweet, relevant Phish jam from last year&apos;s Oklahoma City show, and <strike>send us your sky photos</strike> (good job guys, we&apos;ve got enough photos now!).</p>
