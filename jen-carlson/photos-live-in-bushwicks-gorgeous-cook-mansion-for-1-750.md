<p>Have you ever slowly slinked by this out-of-place-and-time mansion while riding the JMZ? It&apos;s gorgeous, just sitting there in the middle of Bushwick, like a castle. And now YOU can live there for the low price of $1750/month. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232801/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/fee/4334075219.html">A Craiglist post</a> advertises it as newly renovated and &quot;loaded with such charming features as hardwood floors, a front balcony, new appliances and so much more!&quot; Here&apos;s what the 546-square-foot, 1-bedroom interior looks like: </p>

<p>The home used to belong to Dr. Frederick A. Cook, who according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232801/http://forgotten-ny.com/2001/02/bushwick-brooklyn/">Forgotten-NY</a> was (possibly but probably not!) &quot;the first American to climb Alaska&#x2019;s Mount McKinley and the first explorer to reach the North Pole.&quot; Cook lived in the grand home, located at Bushwick and Willoughby Avenues, after brewer William Ulmer, who lived there after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232801/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2549.pdf">Catherina Lipsius</a>. She was owner of the Claus Lipsius Brewing Company, and had the home constructed in the 1890s. It has also been a clinic, and was left abandoned for a time before being saved and renovated. That&apos;s a lot of history! So you can assume the rent is fairly reasonable because of all the ghosts you&apos;ll be sharing with.
