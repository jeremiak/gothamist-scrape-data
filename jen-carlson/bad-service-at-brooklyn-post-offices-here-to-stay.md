title: Bad Service At Brooklyn Post Offices Here To Stay!
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bkpo0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610091943im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bkpo0110.jpg" width="250" height="195" class="image-left"> </span>After 40 were on the chopping block, word now is there will be no Brooklyn post offices closing anytime soon &#x2014; which can only help the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610091943/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/16/post_office_1.php">insufferable longs lines</a> and customer service provided at various branches... right?</p>

<p>The USPS lost $3.8 billion in the 2009 fiscal year, and they were looking to consolidate branches country-wide. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610091943/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_post_offices_spared_from_tVcoUVIeNnIQGoL13cGhhJ">the NY Post</a>, they balanced their budget (novel idea) which saved the borough&apos;s branches... for now. However, just because they remain open, doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll be seeing improved service. In fact, part of the cost-cutting measures that did go through include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610091943/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/16/longer_waits_at_the_post_office_thi.php">reducing staff</a> and adjusting hours.</p>

<p>As for city closures, only two post offices in the area may be shut down in the near future, and both are in Queens.</p>
