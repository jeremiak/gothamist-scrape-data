</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123206/http://gothamist.com/tags/boardwalkempire"><em>Boardwalk Empire</em></a> returns to the airwaves on September 25th, and they&apos;re ringing in season 2 with an ad buy. But it&apos;s an interesting one! They&apos;ll be bringing back vintage trains to the subway tracks. We&apos;re told:</p>

<blockquote>Starting on Saturday, September 3rd an authentic vintage 1920&#x2019;s train will run on the express 2/3 track in Manhattan throughout September (specifically, from 12 to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays).  Originally operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) system, the train began service back in 1917 and will once again be operational.  Customers who have the opportunity to ride the vintage train will be transported back in time to the Prohibition era with authentic details such as rattan seats, ceiling fans and drop sash windows, as well as a custom branded interior featuring Boardwalk Empire-inspired period artwork.</blockquote> 

<p>This will be around for four weekends, running through the 25th of September, and will be making stops at 96th, 72nd, and Times Square-42nd street stations only. Bonus: the final weekend some HBO folks will be on the streets to distribute complimentary MetroCards in the vicinity of the Times Square-42nd and 72nd street stations. No word on if there will be air conditioning on the trains, so you might want to leave your wool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123206/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Bags">Oxford Bags</a> at home.</p>
