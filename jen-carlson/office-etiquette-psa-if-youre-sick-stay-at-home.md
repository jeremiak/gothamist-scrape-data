<p><em>And now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011156/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/19/office_etiquette_psa_dont_come_to_t.php">an important reminder</a>... </em></p>

<p>It goes without saying that getting a cold is a drag; you have to miss holiday parties and lay in bed with your foggy head unable to focus on anything except where your next Dayquil fix is coming from. Your eyes are watery, your nose is stuffed up, you are scaring small children with your sound-barrier-breaking sneezes and hacking cough... and that&apos;s just if you have a cold. If you have the flu the nightmare is <em>escalated</em>. So why do some people come in to the office and spread their sick germs everywhere, forcing innocents to be doomed to suffer alongside them?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011156/http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read/22742971/survey_shows_flu_virus_set_to_make_workers">a 2012 study</a>, &quot;80% of office workers show up to work even when they know they are sick... more than two-thirds of workers admit to returning to work when they&apos;re contagious. More than 25% of workers said they come to work to avoid taking a sick day while nearly half said they were concerned that they wouldn&#x2019;t get the job done if they stayed home.&quot; This just leads to a chain reaction of the entire office getting sick, and slowing down productivity all together... so why not stop it at the source? </p>

<p>We can beat this thing, people! If you are able to work remotely, do so when you are dripping with germs. If you can&apos;t &quot;work&quot; remotely, hopefully you have the option of taking a paid sick day (or you will be able to soon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011156/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/17/de_blasio_expands_paid_sick_leave_p.php">thanks de Blasio</a>!) And if you HAVE to come in to the office, know that you are probably going to be the target of some passive aggressive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011156/https://twitter.com/search?q=coworker%20sick&amp;src=typd">Tweets</a>:</p>

<p>Did you know that even when you aren&apos;t sick your desk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011156/http://money.howstuffworks.com/death-by-cubicle1.htm">contains 400 times more bacteria than a toilet seat</a>? Anyway, the Red Cross knows what we&apos;re talking about...</p>
