</div></div>					<p>As with most things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212194925/http://gothamist.com/tags/twinpeaks"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>, it&apos;s best to not think about it <em>too much</em>, which is what we did when we first saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212194925/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dale-Cooper/8731788588">this Facebook page</a> that&apos;s been documenting Agent Dale Cooper wandering around a gloomy-looking Coney Island. Sure, we wondered <em>why</em> this is a thing that exists, but grasping on to the mystery is always so much more fulfilling than attaining the facts.</p>

<p>However, after an office debate about whether this was an Agent Dale Cooper Doppelg&#xE4;nger or an Agent Dale Cooper Photoshop, we needed more than the &quot;about&quot; section was giving us (it reads, simply: &quot;Diane, it&apos;s 10:48 A.M., March 1st 2013. I know it&apos;s been a while. We have lot of catching up to do... &#x2014;&#xA0;DALE COOPER TWIN PEAKS, WA.&quot;) So we reached out to the person running the Facebook page, and got some answers. Pieter Dom, who runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212194925/http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/">Welcome To Twin Peaks</a>, describes his project below. [<strong>Note: if you haven&apos;t watched <em>Twin Peaks</em> sometime over the last twenty years, first: <em>seriously?</em> Second: SPOILER AHEAD.</strong>]</p><blockquote>&quot;As you probably know, the show ended with Dale Cooper becoming possessed by BOB.<p></p>

<p>In the season finale, Laura Palmer tells Dale Cooper that she will see him again &quot;in 25 years.&quot; Laura Palmer died in 1989, so that&apos;s next year: 2014.</p>

<p>Since it&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;re going to see any continuation of the story (Jennifer Lynch, daughter of David, said so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212194925/http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/david-lynch-no-twin-peaks/">last Sunday</a>), I&apos;ve decided to invite artists to &apos;take possession of Dale Cooper&apos; just like BOB and imagine what he&apos;s doing, thinking, visiting...</p>

<p>What you&apos;ve seen on the page so far is the brilliant work of Michelle Levy. I&apos;m very honored that she agreed to be the first artist to crawl into Cooper&apos;s mind. I cannot reveal anything right now about the next artist, but rest assured that the story of Dale Cooper will be continued...&quot;</p></blockquote>Levy (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212194925/http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/photos/dale-cooper-sightings/">who has done this before</a>) explains her work as a reality-fantasy hybrid of sorts&#x2014;she tells us, &quot;I had a Cooper stand-in dressed in a suit who was photographed on site, and some digital magic was used later to turn him into Cooper!&quot;<p></p>

<p>Now someone please start one of these projects for the Log Lady.</p>
