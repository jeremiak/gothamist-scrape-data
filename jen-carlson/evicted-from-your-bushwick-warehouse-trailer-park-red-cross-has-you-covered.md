</div></div>					<p>The twenty residents that were living in what has come to be known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405013557/http://gothamist.com/tags/bushwicktrailerpark">Bushwick Trailer Park</a> are now being taken care of by Red Cross. The artist community had set up shop in an empty warehouse in the neighborhood for a year, but were recently issued a vacate order (one month after The Man already came down on them and started towing their trailers out of the space). The FDNY&apos;s Frank Dwyer wouldn&apos;t go into detail with us about the incident, but told us &quot;there are still conditions which are imminently perilous to human life.&quot;</p>

<p>The residents say they brought the space up to code, and claim they are uncertain why they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405013557/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/bushwick_trailer_park.php">are being evicted</a> in this fashion. </p>

<p>One 27-year-old resident, Chris Van Doren, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405013557/http://www.metro.us/newyork/blog/post/831921--red-cross-cares-for-homeless-trailer-park-hipsters">told Metro</a>, &quot;we&#x2019;re being persecuted.&quot; The paper reports that the residents, who were kicked out again yesterday, have each been supplied with a $50 debit card, two nights at the Days Inn in Sunset Park, and counseling services from The Red Cross.<br>
 <br>
After their two day stay at the Days Inn is up? They&apos;re apparently ready to fight to get back in to their former space, which houses their music studio, darkroom, painting studio, skate ramp, koi pond, and... accordion repair room. Someone just give these people a reality television show! (For now, more photos can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405013557/http://www.palacebeast.com/trailerpark/?page_id=2">on their blog</a>.)</p>
