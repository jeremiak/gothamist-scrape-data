<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="chapman0512.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516191908im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/chapman0512.jpeg" width="220" height="283" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday the killer of former Beatle John Lennon was transferred to a new correctional facility. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516191908/http://gothamist.com/tags/markdavidchapman">Mark David Chapman</a> has been at Attica for 31 years, but yesterday the 57-year-old murderer was moved to Wende, which is 18 miles away in Alden, NY. According to Peter Cutler, a spokesman for the state&apos;s prison and parole system, &quot;this is an unusual move after such a lengthy stay in one facility.&quot;</p>

<p>Cutler talked to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516191908/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/erie-county/article858049.ece">Buffalo News</a>, saying that the prison system &quot;doesn&apos;t disclose the specific reasons why an inmate may be transferred&quot; to a new facility. </p>

<p>Chapman was sentenced to 20 years to life after murdering Lennon outside of his home at the Dakota in 1980, and was placed in Attica after spending a very short time at Sing Sing. In 2010, just before he was denied parole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516191908/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/08/lennons_killer_denied_parole_again.php">for a 6th time</a>, Yoko Ono stated that he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516191908/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/12/yoko_ono_says_chapman_is_safer_in_j.php">safer behind bars</a>. She is expected to protest his parole again in August this year.</p>
