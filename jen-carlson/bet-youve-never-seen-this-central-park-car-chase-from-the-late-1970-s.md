<p>In the 1970s, a young Mandy Patinkin tore up Central Park in a car chase, where he was behind the wheel of an old yellow cab. The intense scene is part of <em>Night of the Juggler</em>, a bit of a cult classic, but one of those cult classics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108131935/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/night_of_the_juggler/">that kind of stands up</a>. Check it out (and yes, that&apos;s James Brolin).</p>

<p>The movie, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108131935/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/movie/night-of-the-juggler/">is screening at Nitehawk</a> this month as part of their excellent Deuce series, follows and ex-cop (Brolin) on a mission to get his daughter back from a kidnapper (Cliff Gorman), who he mistook for his actual target, a wealthy businessman&apos;s daughter. </p>

<p>Throughout the 101 minutes, you&apos;ll be taken to the South Bronx, where Brolin&apos;s character tangles with a street gang, and Times Square, where he finds himself in trouble at a massage parlor.</p>

<blockquote>The director, Robert Butler, has worked mostly in television and on Disney films in the past. Though he overloads the story desperately, he also gives it a lot of verve, and the film&apos;s street scenes have a crisp immediacy. He has also cast the film beautifully, with Richard Castellano in a scene-stealing supporting role and a pair of talented newcomers in smaller roles. Abby Bluestone is sweetly sympathetic as the kidnapped girl, and Julie Carmen is lovely as a helpful young woman Mr. Brolin meets along the way. She disappears somehow by the end of the movie, but so much else happens that it&apos;s hard to remember where she has gone.</blockquote> 

<p>You can buy tickets for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108131935/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/movie/night-of-the-juggler/">the August 13th screening</a> here. (The series, by the way, is named after &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108131935/http://forgotten-ny.com/2006/06/deuce-42nd-street-manhattan/">The Deuce</a>,&quot; which was the stretch of West 42nd Street between 6th and 8th Avenues that contained a lot of theaters.) </p>

<p>Until then, here&apos;s a totally creepy WPIX spot on the movie, which the station aired in 1986:</p>
