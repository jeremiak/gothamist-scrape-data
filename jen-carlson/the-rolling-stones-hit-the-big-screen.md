<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/20/this_just_in_th.php">Last year</a> the Rolling Stones played two nights at the Beacon Theater (partly to celebrate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/15/mick_and_bill_o.php">Bill Clinton&apos;s 60th birthday</a> - we guess Hillary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/17/senator_hilary.php">will get Celine</a>). It&apos;s just been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN3145145020070731">announced</a> that this September 21st Martin Scorsese will release a documentary filmed at the shows. The larger than life event will become just that in celluloid as it gets the IMAX treatment, but is the world ready for a 50-foot Mick Jagger? Well, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://www.imax.com/films/now_playing/rolling_stone.html">not the first time</a> it&apos;s happened.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/15/ahmet_ertegun_1.php">late Ahmet Ertegun</a> was also at this show, suffering a brain injury that eventually killed him after falling backstage. This will likely be the last footage of him in a healthy state. </p>

<p>The film will be called <em>Shine A Light</em> (after an old Stones gospel song). Scorsese&apos;s past rock doc&apos;s include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://gothamist.com/2005/09/26/no_direction_home.php"><em>No Direction Home</em></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013924/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/features/rock-docs/last-waltz.shtml"><em>The Last Waltz</em></a>.</p>
