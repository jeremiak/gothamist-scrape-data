<p>The most recent episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609082226/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> featured a pre-taped parody commercial for a dating app called Settl. The premise, as you may have gathered from the app&apos;s name, is that dating via apps is a soul-crushing and futile task, and expectations must be lowered if any hollow form of happiness is to be achieved. Enter: Settl, the app that will bring you together with someone who is just okay, in a world where just okay is better than alone forever. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609082226/http://www.hulu.com/watch/879953">The sketch</a> earned a top of the show spot, following Ryan Gosling&apos;s monologue, and now two men have come forward to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609082226/http://flavorwire.com/550509/did-snl-rip-off-these-comedy-writers-dating-app-sketch?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow&amp;utm_campaign=FlavorwireSocial">claim it&apos;s an outright rip off</a> of a sketch they performed live at Comedy Hack Day. And the evidence is pretty damning, as the app in <em>SNL</em>&apos;s segment is exactly the same.</p>

<p>Earlier this year Matt Condon and Ben Zweig gave their presentation for a parody app called Settl at CHD, which is put on by the agency formed by <em>Daily Show</em> producer Baratunde Thurston (who is shown as a Settl user in their sketch). Their performance has been on YouTube since September&#x2014;here it is:</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the SNL version: </p>

<p>The only notable difference is that while Condon and Zweig made the hopeless daters men, SNL made them middle-aged females desperate to get hitched.</p>

<p>Condon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609082226/https://twitter.com/mattgcondon">has been tweeting</a> out his accusations today, and Zweig wrote about it in the form of an open letter to the show posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609082226/https://medium.com/@tfzweig/dear-snl-you-ripped-my-hackathon-project-bde4931dc969#.1scfw2hkf">on Medium</a>, called: &quot;Dear SNL: You Ripped Off My Hackathon Project.&quot;</p><blockquote>Is it possible that your writers happened to come up with the same concept, and the same name? Totally, but given the well-connectedness of our esteemed Comedy Illuminati judges (an ex-Onion editor, an un-aired NBC pilot co-star, the host of BuzzFeed&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ask a Lesbian&#x201D;), I find a total lack of relation unlikely. But let&#x2019;s assume the best and say that your writers thought this up completely independently. Even then, a simple Google search would&#x2019;ve informed you it had been done. Hell, one Reddit user who was searching for your very recent SNL sketch inadvertently found our months-old project instead, and thought them similar enough to post about it. If that ain&#x2019;t damning, I don&#x2019;t know what is. What happened is either a degree of comedic plagiarism, or an impressive lack of basic, easily-done research. In 2015, I&#x2019;m not sure which one is worse.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Of course, this isn&apos;t the first time the show has been accused of joke-stealing, last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609082226/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/06/snl_sketch_ripoff_groundlings.php">they were accused of</a> stealing a sketch from the Groundlings.</p>

<p>We have reached out to SNL about the accusation, and will update if we hear back... but they typically do not respond to these sort of things.</p>
