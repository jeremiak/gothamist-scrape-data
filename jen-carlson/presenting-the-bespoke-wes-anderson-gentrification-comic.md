										<p>Wes Anderson yarn art may <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075620/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/bushwick_crochet_nightmare.php">no longer</a> be a sign that a neighborhood has been gentrified, but there are plenty of other Wes aesthetics hiding in plain sight in neighborhoods like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075620/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/video_crown_heights_locals_react_to.php">ProCro</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075620/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/08/cobble_hook_diaf.php">Cobblehook</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075620/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/11/wino_forever.php">WiNo</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075620/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/09/rambo_everyone_wants_a_piece_of_god.php">Rambo</a>, and more. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075620/http://www.jeremywinslife.com/">Illustrator Jeremy Nguyen</a> presents a few of them below. </p>

<p>But don&apos;t forget, the greatest sign of Wes Anderson gentrification is Wes himself, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075620/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/18/wes_anderson_citibike_nyc.php">gliding by on his precious Citibicycle</a>.</p>
