<p>It&apos;s been well established that everyone in the <em>as-of-now</em> free world is rushing to read <em>1984</em>, our handbook for surviving and understanding the dystopian landscape being created by President Gaslight. There&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170412015353/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/brooklyn_public_library_1984.php">a book club</a>, there are a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170412015353/https://www.amazon.com/1984-Signet-Classics-George-Orwell/dp/0451524934/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485812932&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=1984">Amazon reviews</a>, and Angela Montefinise of the New York Public Library tells us that they&apos;re fresh out of copies. </p>

<p>As of mid last week, the NYPL had 326 English copies of <em>1984</em>, with 37 holds. They also have 40 Spanish copies, with 6 holds. This means all of their copies are checked out, and a waitlist has been started. In addition, the NYPL recently placed orders for 24 new copies of the book, to deal with the increase in demand. Their e-book numbers also showed growth, with 20 e-copies of the book and 107 holds on it. Montefinise says to have that many holds on a book indicates that there has been an increase in demand.</p>

<p>In December, there were 216 checkouts of the physical book, while in all of 2016 there were 1,542. The NYPL did not have numbers of checkouts for previous years.</p>

<p>Still, <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> <a href="had http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/nypl_2.php">had more holds</a> when the books hit their height of popularity in 2012; at the time, the final book in the trilogy had 1,427 holds.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re on the waitlist, Lynn Lobash at the NYPL&apos;s Readers Services team recommends: <em>The Handmaid&#x2019;s Tale</em> by Margaret Atwood, <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> by Ray Bradbury, <em>Memory of Water</em> by Emmi It&#xE4;ranta, or <em>The Sunlight Pilgrims</em> by Jenni Fagan. We recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170412015353/https://www.amazon.com/Little-Kitten-Pictureback-R/dp/0394858182/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485813325&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=kittens"><em>The Little Kitten</em></a> and some wine.</p>
