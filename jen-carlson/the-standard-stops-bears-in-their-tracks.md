Following all the attention they&apos;ve gotten for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194948/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/high_line_peep_show.php">their exhibitionist guests</a> (and staff), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194948/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_331/scoopysnotebook.html">the Villager</a> reports the hotel on the High Line didn&apos;t want the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194948/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/08/sm_fest_1.php">West Village Leather and Bear Street Fair</a> coming near their doors, even though it won unanimous approval from Community Board 2. </p>

<p>Robert Valin, executive director of the event, told the paper, &#x201C;The whole thing has been a complete nightmare for me.&#x201D; He was informed by the Mayor&#x2019;s Office recently that West 13th Street was no longer an option because the Standard Hotel doesn&#x2019;t feel the event &#x201C;fits the image of the hotel.&#x201D; Yes, if we&apos;ve learned anything in the past weeks, it&apos;s that the Standard is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194948/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/26/exhibitionists_are_standard_at_hote.php">known for</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194948/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/28/standard_rear_window_view_on_the_hi.php">its prudish behavior</a>.</p>

<p>With the fair only six weeks away, Valin says, &quot;We don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s going to happen this year&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s because of the Standard Hotel.&#x201D; Oh Andre Balzas, your kinky customers would probably benefit from &quot;the group&#x2019;s goal to educate folks on BDSM&#x2014;such as proper rope-tying, whipping and basic spanking techniques.&quot; And this could make your window displays much more interesting! Think about it, but in the meantime, watch your back; the head bear says, &#x201C;I think we&#x2019;d like to do a lot more to Andre Balazs at this point. I think a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194948/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Andrew%27s_Cross_(BDSM)">St. Andrew&#x2019;s cross</a> would be involved.&#x201D; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194948/http://curbed.com/tags/west-village-leather-and-bear-street-fair">Curbed</a>]</p>
