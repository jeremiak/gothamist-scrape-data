<p>This isn&apos;t vintage B-roll from an Improv Everywhere sketch&#x2014;a tipster sent over this video of Raquel Welch performing a series of dance sequences along with a stereotype-heavy cast in New York City&apos;s subway system (or rather, a very low budget replica of New York City&apos;s subway system), and we couldn&apos;t think of a weirder way to start off the week. See, the 1980s subways <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010054/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php#photo-11">weren&apos;t that bad</a>... expect, things get kind of <em>Fifty Shades Of Leather </em>around the 4:40 mark?</p>
