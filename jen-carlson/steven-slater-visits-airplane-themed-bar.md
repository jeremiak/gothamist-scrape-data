                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="slater1510910.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085106im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/slater1510910.jpg" width="140" height="128" class="image-right"> </span>This is kind of sad. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085106/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevenslater">Steven Slater</a>, the former JetBlue flight attendant whose story we are all familiar with by now, was spotted at Flight 151 last night. That is to say, he went to Chelsea&apos;s airplane-themed restaurant, named Flight 151. This either means he was paid to show up there, or he was just there to feel close to his in-flight past-life (he&apos;s no longer with JetBlue, and faces time behind bars and/or counseling). According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085106/http://blog.zagat.com/steven-slater-jetblue-folk-hero-spotted-at-airplane-themed-restaurant">Zagat&apos;s blog</a>, &quot;the spot is full of mile-high paraphernalia like life jackets and flight suits&quot;&#x2014;but no emergency slides to activate. Allegedly he gave a few customers his best flight attendant &#x201C;bye-bye&#x201D; as they departed. His last salutation to <em>real</em> airline passengers was &quot;To the fucking asshole that told me to fuck off, it&apos;s been a good 28 years!&quot;</p>
