                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0613NPHTONYS.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053319im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0613NPHTONYS.jpg" width="640" height="354" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Did nothing interesting <em>at all</em> happen at the Tonys last night? Because all we&apos;re hearing about is how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053319/http://gothamist.com/tags/neilpatrickharris">Neil Patrick Harris</a> said a word that to some people sounded like the N-word even though it wasn&apos;t. BREAKING NEWS DRUDGE SIREN ALERT. The moment some are scrutinizing can be seen below, when NPH sings alongside Mike Tyson in his stellar opening performance, belting out the words: &quot;And make things bigger, like bigger. I&apos;m here with Iron Mike Tyson he&apos;s a heavyweight yo. We&apos;re going bigger, the night is bigger.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though the lyrics are very clear, outlets like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053319/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2338861/Neil-Patrick-Harris-drops-N-word-performs-musical-number-Mike-Tyson-Tony-Awards.html">the Daily Mail</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053319/http://www.tmz.com/2013/06/10/neil-patrick-harris-tony-awards-tony-awards-n-word/">TMZ</a> are wondering if he said:  &quot;We&apos;re going bigger, is I his n***a&apos;.&quot; NPH has Tweeted in response, &quot;Really, Daily Mail?!? The N-word? That&#x2019;s your story?!? I would NEVER be so disrespectful and frankly, neither should you.&quot;</p>

<p>A representative for the actor notes that &quot;he said &apos;bigger&apos; many times.&quot; So can we just focus on the real issue here: where do we stand on rhyming the same words?</p>
