<p>A couple of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015009/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/13/this_weekends_theme_waiting_on_line.php">weeks ago</a>, the McCarren Park Pool line flowed through the sidewalks for The Breeders free show. Today a reader sent in this photo of the line for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015009/http://www.myspace.com/mgmt">MGMT</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015009/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/07/once_and_for_all_how_do_you_pr.html">pronounced</a> &quot;Em Gee Em Tee&quot;), taken just before 2 p.m. However, the skies have darkened and now there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015009/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/13/this_weekends_theme_waiting_on_line.php">severe thunderstorm watch</a>, so chances are the line has dissipated if you want to brave the weather.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This just in from the pool at 5:30 p.m. &quot;The Parks Dept. is threatening to shut the pool down if they let anyone else in.&quot; Also, Kirsten Dunst has been spotted.</p>
