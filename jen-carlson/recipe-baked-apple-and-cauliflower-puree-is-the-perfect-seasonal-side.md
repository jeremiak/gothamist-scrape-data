<p>Mashed cauliflower is a great healthier, lighter, and less starchy alternative to your standard mashed potato, but sometimes if you aren&apos;t prepared to double down on the seasoning and sour cream it can taste a little bland. Like water, to be exact. But the solution isn&apos;t adding half a grinder of sea salt, <em>it&apos;s apples</em>. Somehow, just one baked apple can make all the difference in this dish, and since we&apos;ve officially entered baked apple season m*therf*ckers, <em>let&apos;s do this</em>...</p>

<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong><br>
2 small, or 1 large apple<br>
1 head of cauliflower<br>
1 or 2 tbsp of butter<br>
Fresh dill<br>
Sea salt<br>
Cheddar (optional but highly recommended!)</p>

<p><strong>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</strong><br>
First, start boiling your water and chop up your cauliflower into florets so they&apos;re ready to toss in once the pot starts boiling. </p>

<p>Next, slice up the apple and bake it at 375&#xB0; for about 7 minutes (you just want to get it tender). </p>

<p>Is your water boiling? Add the cauliflower florets and boil for about 10 minutes. </p>

<p>Once the apples and cauliflower are ready, either blend them together in your Cuisinart, or use a hand blender to get the job done. Either way, mix in the fresh dill (as much as you&apos;d like), 1 or 2 tablespoons of butter (or more if you want, we&apos;re not here to judge), and sea salt (let&apos;s say three twists on that Pink Himalayan Sea Salt grinder everyone gets at Trader Joe&apos;s). Once it&apos;s blended to a consistency you like, shred some cheddar cheese on top, mix it in with a spoon, and you&apos;re all set. Here&apos;s what this all basically looks like: </p>

<p>This yields about three servings, or maybe just one serving if you are making it your entire meal and eating it out of a bowl with a wooden spoon like some kind of monster who never grew up or prepares themselves well-rounded meals.</p>
