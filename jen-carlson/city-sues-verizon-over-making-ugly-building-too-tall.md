<p>Located at 375 Pearl Street in Manhattan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030232638/http://www.tribecatrib.com/news/2009/december/462_city-says-verizon-cheated-on-lower-manhattan-tower-deal.html">the TriBeca Trib</a> reports that the city is now suing Verizon and real estate company Taconic Investment Partners for $53 million. Allegedly the city lost that much money after what they claim were fraudulent dealings.</p>

<p>When they purchased the land and air rights from the city in 1972, &quot;the agreement called for the phone company to give the city $17 million and to build Murry Bergtraum High School. But, the city says, New York Telephone built far more usable space&#x2014;1.2 million square feet&#x2014;than it said it would, thereby undervaluing the deal and shortchanging taxpayers.&quot;</p>

<p>They claim Verizon covered up illegal construction, and the scheme only came to light in 2007, when the company sold 29 of the 32 stories to Taconic for $172 million (a discounted price the city says the investment firm got as a direct result of Verizon&apos;s fraud). Unfortunately, this lawsuit could put an end to the renovation Taconic had planned, as the city is also asking for an injunction.
