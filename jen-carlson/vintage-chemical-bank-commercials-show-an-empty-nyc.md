<p>Below, enjoy a few videos from the vaults, all commercials from Chemical Bank that originally aired around the 1960s. While many of their commercials around then focused on the women of NYC, another campaign featured an apocalyptic-looking, empty New York City as its backdrop... one featuring a screaming Roy Scheider&#x2014; &quot;C&apos;mon, will ya, wake up! You could be doin&apos; something instead of sleeping your life away!&quot; If these are in fact from the &apos;60s, this would have been prior to his gig as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150737/http://gothamist.com/tags/jaws">Chief Martin Brody</a>.</p>

<p>Below are a few of our favorites, and there are plenty more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150737/http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUp_ecAECmZQDxxI5pr3pCuA">on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re wondering what happened to the bank, here&apos;s your brief history: They were headquartered in New York City from 1824 to 1996, and that year they acquired Chase, adopting their name and brand.
