Now a recent visitor is claiming she contracted an ear infection from the tank, as did her boyfriend. She tells us:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;I went to the New Museum with my boyfriend on Sunday, November 27th. My boyfriend and I waited in line for three hours to float in the sensory deprivation tank... Which means that I would float around naked in a tank that many museum visitors had already been in that day. I recognize some risks here, but the water was heavily chemically treated, and the NY Health Department had already cracked down on them for some issues, so I figured, how much more dangerous could this be than a typical pool?

<p>Well, at least marginally more dangerous. Two days later, we both had very painful ear infections in both ears. I had never had an ear infection in my life! After 8 days of antibiotics, our ear infections are STILL not gone. I tried to post this information on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521011734/http://experiencewiki-newmuseum.tumblr.com/">their Tumblr</a>, but surprise, surprise, the moderator has not yet approved my post.&quot;</p></blockquote>Aside from trying to post on the Tumblr, she hasn&apos;t tried contacting the museum. We reached out this morning for a comment, but have yet to hear back. It&apos;s possible this infection came from somewhere else, or that&apos;s it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521011734/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/swimmers-ear/DS00473">swimmer&apos;s ear</a>, but she tells us, &quot;I am absolutely certain it came from the tank. We both are not prone to infections&#x2014;and I&apos;ve never had an ear infection before.&quot; Has anyone else experienced a problem at the exhibit (which, by the way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521011734/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/25/the_new_museums_giant_slide_is_here.php#photo-1">is pretty amazing</a>, so we hope not).<p></p>
