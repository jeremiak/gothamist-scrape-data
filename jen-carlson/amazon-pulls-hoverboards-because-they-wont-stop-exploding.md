<p>Following a series of hoverboard explosions, Amazon has pulled some of the electric transportation devices from its marketplace. Amazon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://wgno.com/2015/12/10/overstock-com-no-longer-selling-hoverboards/">joins Overstock.com</a>, who also recently pulled the product from their site. Though there are currently still two brands, Razor and Jetson, available on Amazon.</p>

<p>There have been reports throughout the year of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://gothamist.com/tags/hoverboards">hoverboards</a> exploding, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://qz.com/545384/hoverboards-keep-catching-fire-and-exploding-in-the-uk/">England</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/55136359-story">Alabama</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://wgno.com/2015/11/29/exploding-hoverboard-blamed-for-destroying-lafitte-familys-home/">Louisiana</a>, and most recently at a mall in Washington: </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2015/12/14/amazon-stops-selling-some-hoverboards-over-safety/77275814/">USA Today</a>, the leading hoverboard-maker is Swagway, and even they&apos;ve been banned from Amazon, who is &quot;requesting companies manufacturing the popular devices to prove they are safe to use.&quot; </p>

<p>While Amazon has not commented on pulling hoverboards off their virtual shelves, Swagway sent this statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/12/10016416/amazon-hoverboards-pull">to Verge</a>:</p><blockquote>Amazon just sent out a notice to all &quot;hoverboard&quot; sellers to &quot;provide documentation demonstrating that all hoverboards you list are compliant with applicable safety standards, including UN 38.3 (battery), UL 1642 (battery), and UL 60950-1 (charger).&quot;<p></p>

<p>Swagway already meets all those certifications and is happy that Amazon has decided to take steps to weed out the low quality boards. As safety is always on the forefront for Swagway, we&apos;re glad that this is taking place, especially in light of recent concerns with the fires with the poor quality batteries.</p>

<p>On that note, we&apos;re also in the process of working on measures, to help consumers identify between an authenic Swagway and the many imitation boards that are adding our branded logo to their unauthorized boards. Meanwhile, we ask that consumers only purchase from authorized retailers as an added precaution.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://www.popsci.com/what-are-hoverboards-and-why-do-they-explode">Popular Science</a>, &quot;In most cases, a hoverboard explodes because it comes equipped with a faulty battery.&quot; They also note that less expensive models may not be built properly and could, you know, spontaneously catch fire. </p>

<p>Currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/mcfly_and_get_fined.php">hoverboards are illegal in NYC</a>, and they&apos;ve also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402034914/http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/10/news/companies/overstock-hover-boards/index.html">been banned</a> by major airlines.</p>
