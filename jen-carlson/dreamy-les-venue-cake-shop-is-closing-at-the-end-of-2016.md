<p>In recent years we&apos;ve seen a number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://gothamist.com/tags/riples">closures on the Lower East Side</a>&#x2014;restaurants, bars, and venues from a very special time (that is, when <em>I lived there</em>) have shuttered faster than you can say &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/07/soho_houses_les_outpost.php">SoHo House</a>.&quot; Let&apos;s do a roll call: Pink Pony, Max Fish, Motor City Bar, the Dark Room, the Living Room, Fontana&apos;s, El Sombrero, Alias, Lolita... and that&apos;s just in the past few years. Newcomers probably don&apos;t even know about places like Rothko, Luna Lounge, Sin-&#xE9;, and Tonic. If you lived on the LES in the early aughts, your local bar or venue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/07/beloved_old_les_venue_will_become_c.php">is now a condo</a>. And Cake Shop is the latest casualty. </p>

<p>The 10+ year old DIY venue, known for its charming twinkly lights, tinsel, and unique general admission floor space that sloped downward toward the band, has &quot;quietly and privately announced&quot; that New Year&apos;s Eve will be their last night, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/cake-shop-closing-new-years-eve/">Brooklyn Vegan</a>. We&apos;ve reached out to the owners for more details and will update if we hear back, but the news is not a huge surprise. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/08/cake_shop_crumbles.php">Last year</a> the venue was looking for an investor, citing a dire financial situation and inability to pay rent and other bills. They suffered through similar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/cake_shop_lives_to_rock_another_day.php">issues back in 2012</a>, but managed to remain open.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/https://www.facebook.com/cakeshopnyc/">venue/bar/cafe/record store</a> has been a tiny little haven on Ludlow Street, featuring some great lineups in their homey basement cavern. Tickets to remaining shows can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://www.ticketfly.com/venue/3645-cake-shop/">be purchased here</a>.</p>

<p>So, what&apos;s left? Mercury Lounge, which has been safe likely because it is owned by Bowery Presents. And Pianos, the cockroach of Ludlow Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/29/pianos_expanding_the_living_room_mo.php">will probably never die</a>.</p>

<p>Update: It&apos;s possible it will turn into a &quot;regular bar&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229201149/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2016/12/curtains-cake-shop-last-live-show-new-years-eve/">with no live music</a> and a different name.</p>
