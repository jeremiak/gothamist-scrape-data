<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sailboatimplosion.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153959im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sailboatimplosion.jpg" width="300" height="202" class="image-right"> </span>This Sunday, bright and early in the morning, a building will be destroyed on Governors Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153959/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/governors_island_building_will_be_i.php">with 200 lbs of dynamite</a>. And while there are a few places where you&apos;ll be able to get a glimpse of the implosion, there&apos;s only one place where you can do it while drinking prosecco on a boat. This Sunday, witness the Governors Island building demolition from Manhattan By Sail&apos;s prized schooner, which will circle the Island as you devour a full brunch spread.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153959/https://experiences.groupme.com/experiences/manhattan-by-sail-demolition">event page</a> explains how awesome this will be: &quot;Brunching (replete with prosecco bar) on a classic schooner in the New York Harbor while watching a half-century-old, 115-foot-tall building on Governors Island be decimated with dynamite: OMG, THERE ARE NO WORDS.&quot;</p>

<p>This &quot;life-changing urban brunch-boat experience&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153959/https://experiences.groupme.com/experiences/manhattan-by-sail-demolition">will cost $95</a>, and will start Sunday morning at 6:45 am (through 9 a.m.). A less life-changing experience would be to livestream the implosion while eating breakfast in bed, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153959/http://govislandblog.com/2013/05/29/derelict-building-on-southern-end-of-governors-island-to-be-imploded-to-make-way-for-new-park/">it&apos;s an option</a> none-the-less.</p>

<p>The building being leveled is Building 877, the tallest building on Governors Island at 115-feet and 11-stories high. It&apos;s a non-historic building, located on the island&apos;s southern end, and its demolition will make way for a new play lawn.</p>
