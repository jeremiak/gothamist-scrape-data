<p>Alfred Hitchcock would have been celebrating a birthday today, had he lived into his centenarian years. While in New York City, the director enjoyed dining out the 21 Club. He wasn&apos;t the only old school A-lister to frequent the restaurant (Nixon still has his own bottle of wine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200313/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/18/inside_21_1.php">in their secret cellar</a>), though he was a dedicated regular, and even mentioned the place in <em>North by Northwest</em>, when Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) discusses &quot;dinner at 21&quot; to his secretary at the beginning of the movie.</p>

<p>Perhaps Hitchcock enjoyed it a little too much, however. Here is a tale from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200313/http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2011/08/13">the Writer&apos;s Almanac</a> about his insatiable appetite:</p>

<blockquote>Hitchcock had a legendary appetite. He liked to say, &quot;I&apos;m not a heavy eater. I&apos;m just heavy, and I eat.&quot; Apparently, shortly after Hitchcock came to America from England, he went out to New York City&apos;s 21 Club. Hitchcock ordered a steak dinner, followed by an ice cream parfait; then he ordered another steak dinner, and another ice cream; and then the entire thing one more time. 

<p>At the end of his three meals and three desserts, he drank a cup of strong tea and a glass of brandy, and told his companions: &quot;There is as much anticipation in confronting good food as there is in going on a holiday or seeing a good show. There are two kinds of eating &#x2014; eating to sustain and eating for pleasure. I eat for pleasure.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p></p>

<p>Still, the man lived to the ripe old age of 80, which is not bad for a 3-steak-dinner guy. </p>

<p>Ogden Nash wrote a poem titled: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200313/http://www.thegloss.com/2010/11/24/beauty/retro-snap-john-rawlings-and-ogden-nash-and-alfred-hitchcock/">How to Hitchcock</a>,&quot; which accompanied photos that John Rawlings took of him at the 21 Club in 1956, mostly hovered over a turkey. It went: &quot;Pick a Hitchcock of opulence rather than corpulence, just pleasingly plump, with a snug silhouette to embellish the board when the places are set. For the ultimate test, more closely examine it. The Hitchcock supreme has a wide streak of ham in it.&quot; If you want to Hitchcock, you can get a 28 Day Dry-aged Ribeye Steak in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200313/http://www.21club.com/web/onyc/bar_room_dinner_menu.jsp">the Bar Room</a> at 21 for $68. But to go Full Hitchcock, be prepared to spend over $300. (And wear a suit jacket if you&apos;re a man and no jeans for anybody; the dress code is strictly enforced.)</p>
