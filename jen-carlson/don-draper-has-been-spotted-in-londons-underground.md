<p>Across the pond the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170249/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2625.aspx">Transport for London</a> has stolen our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170249/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen">Don Draper</a>, slapped a red tie on him, and thrown him on their safety posters. At least, that&apos;s what it looks like... he&apos;s even falling, like in the show&apos;s intro and AMC&apos;s recent fifth season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170249/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/mad_men_posters_get_tagged_untagged.php#photo-1">ad campaign</a>. </p>

<p>MTA, <em>why didn&apos;t you think of this?</em> It&apos;s not too late, let&apos;s help them withe some ideas for a future <em>MTA Men</em> campaign. We&apos;ll start: An anti-groping campaign featuring Don Draper on a crowded subway with a martini in one hand and a woman&apos;s ass in the other.
