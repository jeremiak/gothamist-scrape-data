Khan weaves a world all her own with her music and artwork, and happily invites anyone to come join her there. We wouldn&apos;t be surprised if at university she majored in nostalgia, with so much attention drawn back to childhood in her work. Her wide-eyed world of yesteryear is a little bit magical, a little bit noir, and seems to be fueled by a never-ending supply of innocence, experience and anticipation.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night her band plays at the Knitting Factory (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108001412/http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=186998">buy tickets here</a>). </p>

<p><strong>As a visual artist and a musician, do you find the two mediums inspire each other?</strong><br>
Definitely - to me they are synonymous, like brother and sister. When writing songs gets a little bit tough, I can go away and make something visual, like illustrations, or photographs or embroider something. It takes the pressure off, and means I can continue to build my universe without going crazy!</p>

<p><strong>What is some of your favorite album artwork from other bands?</strong><br>
I would have to say a band called Moon and Moon who come from Brooklyn, because the artwork is so intrinsic to the narrative of the music. And Will Lemon, (who&apos;s band it is and who does the artwork) uses the ancient art of hand made blockprinting and tapestry to make the images...so cool! Also I love the cover of Nico&apos;s &quot;Desert Shores&quot; with the horse and the desert and her little boy - she always looks so beautiful yet so dark! The guys from Godspeed and Silve Mt Zion always do the most beautifully hand made screen printed vinyl pressings with ravens and angels and thundering skies! gorgeous and special.</p>

<p><strong>You&apos;ve mentioned Grimm&apos;s fairytales, have you found the stories to be somewhat of a muse for the music as well as the videos/artwork associated with it?</strong><br>
I do love fairytales, but actually not so much the Grimms ones as the older more barbaric and ancient pagan ones! I love a book called &quot;women who run with the wolves&quot; as it contains Jungian philosophies and interpretations of all the old fairytales before they became too standardized and clean. I was brought up in a strict religion and so the act of storytelling is deeply embedded in me - I think thats why I was instantly attracted to deep southern/gothic American lyrics and music - and then fell in love with the biblical imagery of blues, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, etc.</p>

<p><strong>You list &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; as one of your influences, explain.</strong><br>
This film is one of several that I call the &quot;80s hoodie films&quot; - along with ET, Donnie Darko, The Goonies - as they all contain seminal scenes in them where the kids get on their bikes, wearing the coolest hoodies and cycle out on an adventure in to the unknown. This moment symbolizes something so deep and important to me - an epiphany when you move out of your comfortable childhood microcosm into the big bad world, to communicate with something terrifying and beautiful and exciting - to find your own path! It&#x2019;s frightening and can happen all through your life, but its those moments where you decide to go for it, take risks, fulfill your purpose! It&#x2019;s what life is all about, I think....sorry, getting over excited! Ha!</p>
