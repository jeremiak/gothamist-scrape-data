<p>When Brick, Champ, Brian, Veronica and Ron turn up on the big screen after a <em>nine year</em> absence this December, they&apos;ll be in a new decade and a new city: 1980s New York. The debut full-length <em>Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos;</em>-soundtracked trailer is now here, and shows the news team donning dope fur collars and working at a 24-hour news channel in Manhattan, where Ron is doing what &quot;God put [him] on this Earth to do: have salon-quality hair and read the news.&quot; Spritz on some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175529/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ccp-lEmoAE">Sex Panther&#x2122;</a> and watch it below.</p>

<p>We first heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175529/http://gothamist.com/tags/anchorman"><em>Anchorman</em></a>&apos;s coast change when filming was going on for the sequel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175529/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/anchorman_2_will_take_on_the_nyc_ne.php">earlier this year</a>&#x2014;at the time, an insider on the set (which was mostly in Atlanta) told us: &quot;It&apos;s actually about the NYC news market, so some scenes will be shot there. I saw the plans last week for a set they&apos;re building here that is the interior of a NY brownstone.&quot; </p>

<p><em>Anchorman: The Legend Continues</em> will also feature appearances from: Kristen Wiig, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Greg Kinnear, Harrison Ford, Nicole Kidman, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jim Carrey, James Marsden, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175529/http://laist.com/2013/05/08/kanye_west_will_have_a_cameo_in_anc.php">and Kanye</a>. Prior to the movie opening in December, the news team will get its own exhibit at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175529/http://dcist.com/2013/06/newseum_to_add_anchorman_exhibit.php">Washington D.C.&apos;s Newseum</a> in November.</p>
