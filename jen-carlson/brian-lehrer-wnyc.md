Lehrer will be hosting a special anniversary broadcast taking a look back to when it all began in 1989. </em></p><em>

<p>Also on the show, &quot;Michael Moore will talk via satellite about his new film and the 20 year anniversary of the release of Roger and Me; listeners and a group of 20 year old students will participate in a history and culture quiz; and Brian will lead a discussion on how to keep young people in New York and New Jersey, and on the unique &#x2014; sometimes uplifting, sometimes demoralizing &#x2014; aspects to life&quot; in the city. </p>

</em><p><em>If you aren&apos;t already amongst one of Lehrer&apos;s dedicated listeners, become one today! You can tune in to 93.9 FM, or online, weekdays at 10 a.m.</em></p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s your opinion on Paterson vs. Obama?</strong> I don&apos;t blame the President for wanting to strengthen the Democratic Party nationally. He&apos;s coming off the historic 2006 and 2008 elections with Democrats retaking control after many years, and he wants it to be more than a blip like it was with Clinton in 1992-94. But there is a price, as it becomes even harder for Paterson to do what needs to be done to clean up Albany and deal with the financial crisis if he seems like a lame duck so early.</p>

<p><strong>And Bloomberg&apos;s twenty year long Mayorship?</strong> I understand his position. He doesn&apos;t want to end term limits. He just believes the limit should be five terms!</p>

<p><strong>How has funding changed with public radio since the recession?</strong> We&apos;re holding our own. People appreciate a community-minded station in these times and they donate if they can.</p>

<p><strong>Have you accomplished what you set out to in the last 20 years? Is there anything that you haven&apos;t and would like to?</strong> I guess I&apos;ve accomplished some of what I set out to do. I like to think we&apos;ve built a strong community of people who can come together and get informed about the issues and talk to each other about life in New York and our crazy world in general. For the future, I&apos;d like to do more investigative work and set up more peer to peer structures for listeners to interact with other, to share ideas, and even mutual help in this economy.</p>
