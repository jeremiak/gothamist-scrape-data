<p>The first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822204236/https://www.facebook.com/DinerEnBlanc.newyork">D&#xEE;ner en Blanc</a> to happen in the U.S. is scheduled to go on tonight, somewhere in New York City. The event (described as bringing together &quot;the elegance and glamour of court society&quot;) is part of a 23-year-old French tradition, which brings thousands together for a massive dinner party. Everyone wears white, brings a white table, white chairs, and tonight: a white umbrellla. The 1,000 New Yorkers who registered and were chosen to be a part of the picnic have been told: &quot;The D&#xEE;ner en Blanc is an outdoor event. If it rains, just bring an umbrella or a transparent raincoat. If it&apos;s &apos;pouring buckets&apos; we will move under a covered space until showers pass.&quot; Organizers have confirmed with us that the event will be happening as of now, despite those foreboding skies out there.</p>

<p>Guests attending are to bring their own dinner in a white picnic basket (though dinners are available for purchase), a white candle, a bottle opener (wine is provided), cutlery, a trash bag, and the aforementioned items. Right before the event takes place, around 6:45 p.m., they will be informed of a meeting spot, and be taken on foot or by subway to the secret picnic space.</p>

<p>We&apos;ll be on hand and will report back tomorrow with photos... of what may end up being the city&apos;s biggest wet t-shirt contest.</p>
