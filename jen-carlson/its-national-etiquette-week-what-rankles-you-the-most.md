<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065838/http://gothamist.com/tags/nationaletiquetteweek">National Etiquette Week</a> once again, and we&apos;ll be (politely) celebrating for the next five days. To start things off, tell us what irks you the most when you&apos;re out there on the sidewalks, underground in the subway system, sitting in a movie theater, ordering at Starbucks... or anywhere else in New York City. We&apos;ve likely covered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065838/http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette">your pet peeve</a> before, but we can&apos;t stop/won&apos;t stop until people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065838/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/subway_etiquette_101_please_dont_hu.php">stop hugging the subway poles</a>, dammit.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t forget to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065838/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos of people breaking the unspoken etiquette laws of New York (also, tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr, or hashtag them #Gothamist on Instagram).</p>
