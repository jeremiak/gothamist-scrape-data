title: Video: Kids React To Lady Gaga, And Have No Idea Who Letterman Is
---

	
										<p>Kids are so terrifyingly honest! So what do they really think of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170512033751/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a>? They recently reacted to her appearance on David Letterman (though they refer to him as &quot;some guy,&quot; and &quot;an anchorman&quot;)&#x2014;which one do you agree with (vote below)? And did you know that in the Philippines her name translates to Lady Stupid? Kid facts!</p>

<p>Also, sad face, the kids say there&apos;s nowhere to watch music videos except on YouTube (R.I.P. MTV). </p>
