                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="petaadairportscan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928051348im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/petaadairportscan.jpg" width="275" height="356" class="image-right"> </span>The company in charge of advertising for JFK and LaGuardia airports&#x2014;JCDecaux North America&#x2014;is the latest to reject <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928051348/http://gothamist.com/tags/peta">PETA</a> for one of their proposed campaigns. We&apos;re told by the animal rights organization that the pictured ad was rejected for being &quot;too sexy.&quot; A spokesman for PETA also explained:</p>

<blockquote>The ad, which PETA had hoped to display near the full-body scanners that will be installed at the two airports, shows an airport security X-ray scan of a trim woman wearing a bra and panties that are printed with the words &quot;Be Proud of Your Body Scan: Go Vegan.&quot; Many studies have shown that eating a vegan diet helps prevent obesity and heart disease. Bob Cilia, executive vice president of sales and marketing for JCDecaux North America, told PETA that the company doesn&apos;t &quot;accept nudity or political ads&quot; and added that although he has seen ads that are more risqu&#xE9;, he was just following policy by rejecting PETA&apos;s ad.</blockquote>

<p>Well, it&apos;s better than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928051348/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/21/full-body_imaging_scanners_coming_t.php">official imagery</a> being used for the scanners, and it&apos;s not like the model is wearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928051348/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/06/scanners_coming_to_airports_next_mo.php">flying pasties</a>!</p>
