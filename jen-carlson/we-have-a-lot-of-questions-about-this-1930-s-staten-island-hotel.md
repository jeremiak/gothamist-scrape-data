<p>We came across this photo in the New York Public Library&apos;s digital archive, and were kind of stunned it was taken in New York City... Staten Island, to be exact. But precious little information is available about this place. The library&apos;s caption simply reads: &quot;May&apos;s&#x2014;view of building, patio with umbrella tables, dance hall entrance, sign advertising May&apos;s Hotel Bar and Grill.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033700/http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/27036">On Cinema Treasures</a> they say it &quot;was actually built on the sands, between South Beach and Graham Beach,&quot; next to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033700/http://www.nycago.org/Organs/SI/html/StrandTheatre.html">the Strand Theater</a>. When May&apos;s took over the space from the Grand View Hotel in the 1930s, it converted the old theater into the dance hall you see in the photo. The Strand was located at 23 Nelson Avenue, and now that corner is occupied by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033700/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1869&amp;bih=887&amp;q=23+Nelson+Avenue+staten+island&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89c24bb709736d59:0xe6854555ab4a8455,23+Nelson+Ave,+Staten+Island,+NY+10308&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=k6eZT5S3AqqF6QGujf3yBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCAQ8gEwAA">a steakhouse</a>.</p>

<p>Still, we have so many questions left about this mysterious May&apos;s: how long did it stay open for? Who went there? What was on their menu? Why does it look like it&apos;s on the shoreline if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033700/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=23+Nelson+Avenue+staten+island&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.547673,-74.14645&amp;spn=0.006253,0.015965&amp;sll=40.549433,-74.150632&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=23+Nelson+Ave,+Staten+Island,+Richmond,+New+York+10308&amp;t=h&amp;z=17">it isn&apos;t</a>? And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033700/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/shuffleboard.php">was there shuffleboard</a>?!</p>
