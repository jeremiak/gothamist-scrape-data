And by the time you are done reading this interview there is a chance he&apos;ll have conquered some other creative corner of the world (keep up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160202185923/http://twitter.com/bradwalsh">on Twitter</a>). Walsh&apos;s remix album, titled &quot;Unhitched, Restitched&quot; is set to drop this summer, but for now, get to know the man behind the mixing boards, the camera, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160202185923/http://www.bradwalsh.com/2010/02/jewelry-by-brad-walsh/">gorgeous rings</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Photographer, musician, jewelry designer... is there anything else?</strong> I paint some. Not well. Hmm... though I do cook! Slap a dress on me and call me Katie Lee Joel and I could host Top Chef.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other worlds you&apos;d like to conquer?</strong> This is so cliche but the two other things I would love to get into are directing/producing video, or designing menswear. I sorta started in on it by directing my own music video for my song &quot;Human Nature.&quot; And I have a lot of say when Christian designs clothes for me to wear to events. But they both excite me so I would love to do more!</p>

<p><strong>Which talent do you most naturally gravitate towards; do you consider yourself a musician above anything else?</strong> Yeah, I do. Music is what I&apos;m always thinking about. Photography has always been just a hobby for me, but it&apos;s so much quicker and easier that I&apos;ve done quite a lot of it. I think, though, that creative people are just creative, so it&apos;s not all that odd to me when you have these megacreators like Beyonce or Gwen Stefani or, I don&apos;t know, maybe Jamie Foxx, who do music and film and art and fashion all very well. I can&apos;t actually think of any shining examples right now. Jennifer Lopez keeps popping into my head. But... you know. Not quite right.</p>
