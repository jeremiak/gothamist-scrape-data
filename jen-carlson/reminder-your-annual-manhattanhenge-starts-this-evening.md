<p>In February <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120530232241/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/save_the_dates_for_this_years_manha.php">we noted</a> (thanks to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson) that the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120530232241/http://gothamist.com/tags/manhattanhenge">Manhattanhenge</a> dates would be occurring on May 29th, May 30th, July 11th, and July 12th. So here&apos;s your reminder that this evening at sunset (8:17 p.m.) you&apos;ll be able to capture the half-sun aligning with the city&apos;s grid (tomorrow will be the full sun). But how can you best experience the event? First, be careful if you are standing in the middle of traffic:</p>

<p>Second, listen to deGrasse Tyson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120530232241/http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/resources/starstruck/manhattanhenge">who says</a>: &quot;For best effect, position yourself as far east in Manhattan as possible. But ensure that when you look west across the avenues you can still see New Jersey. Clear cross streets include 14th, 23rd, 34th. 42nd, 57th, and several streets adjacent to them. The Empire State building and the Chrysler building render 34th street and 42nd streets especially striking vistas.&quot;</p>
