title: Video: Artist Talks About "The Andy"
---

	
										<p>Artist Rob Pruitt talks about Andy Warhol, soup cans, and his tribute to the artist: that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150751/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/andy_warhol_1.php">7-foot-tall, chrome-finished statue</a> now in Union Square. Pruitt explains his piece and how Andy has inspired him, saying, &quot;What propelled me to New York wasn&apos;t just the paintings of soup cans and Marilyn Monroe, etc, but the man himself. I knew that I wanted to live a similar life, and so I came to New York to pursue that dream. It&apos;s clear to me that so many of us come to New York to pursue a kind of Warholian dream, so I thought a monument to him... it would be something more than art, it would be like filling a void.&quot; (Are people still coming to New York to pursue a Warholian dream? Discuss.)</p>
