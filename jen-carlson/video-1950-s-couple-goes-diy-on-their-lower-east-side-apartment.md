<p>We just stumbled upon this sweet vintage video on a trip down the Youtube rabbit hole, showing a Manhattan couple trying to make their tiny apartment into a livable space. People from the 1950s: they&apos;re just like us!</p>

<p>Meet Jack and Jill (not their real names!), a couple living in a walkup on the Lower East Side in the 1950s. Here they are in their apartment, which is filled with hand-me-downs, trying to renovate their small living space on a small budget. And their amazing renovation is all in thanks to a brochure from... Ohio.</p>
