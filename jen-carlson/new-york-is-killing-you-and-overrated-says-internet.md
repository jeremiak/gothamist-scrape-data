<p>What is New York? This Algorithm Nation map is based on search engine autocomplete results from Yahoo! (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308002749/http://www.flipcollective.com/2013/02/04/the-united-states-is-how-autocomplete-describes-the-50-states-by-matt-shirley/">the creators say</a> that search engine produced the most results), but according to <em>both</em> Yahoo! and Google, the city is <em>killing us</em>. The other most popular searches show that it is also &quot;overrated&quot; and &quot;big&quot;&#x2014;and sadly, it seems some people out there don&apos;t know what state New York is in.</p>
