<p>It&apos;s Shia LeBeouf&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507192250/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/12/shia_day_3_still_got_it.php">last day at the Angelika Film Center</a>, where he has been since Tuesday morning watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507192250/http://gothamist.com/tags/allmymovies">all of his movies</a> in reverse chronological order. We&apos;re told that everything will wrap up around 10 p.m. tonight, and currently there are about 150 people on line still hoping to get in. Here&apos;s what the scene looked like around 11:30 a.m. today.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507192250/http://twitter.com/bfishbfish">Rebecca Fishbein</a> is in the lobby, where the livestream is screening and where cheers fill the room whenever another person gets the call to enter the theater. This seems to indicate some sort of mental breakdown on the part of those who have imprisoned themselves inside of this alternate universe for around 12 hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inside of the theater, Shia has distributed some pizza. </p>

<p>No one has seen Jaden Smith. </p>

<p>This is all we know. We&apos;ll update if anything happens&#x2014;we&apos;re pretty sure the green-haired girl who left a creepy drawing on Shia&apos;s seat is going to do something. Any. Minute. Now.</p>
