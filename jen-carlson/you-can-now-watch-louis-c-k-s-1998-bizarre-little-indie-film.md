										<p>As we know from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153511/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/10/video_a_young_louis_ck_shows_off_to.php">his MTV Artumentary</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153511/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/videos_louis_cks_short_films_from_t.php">black &amp; white short films</a> from the &apos;90s, Louis C.K. was straying outside the lines of the comedy stage well before his FX series. And recently he announced one of his decades-old efforts in film would finally be released&#x2014;C.K.-style, for 5 bucks through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153511/http://louisck.com/">his website</a>. Today at noon you&apos;ll be able to purchase the movie, called <em>Tomorrow Night</em>, which he made in 1998. He sent out one of his rare emails last night explaining it all:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I made this movie, meaning I wrote and directed it, back in 1998.  I was a struggling comedian and TV writer at the time and I pulled together my savings and some of my fiends money to make this movie on black and white 16mm film.  There are some great people in this movie.  Steve Carell, JB Smoove, Wanda Sykes and Conan O&apos;Brien are some that you might have heard of.  Robert Smigel, Chuck Sklar, Rick Shapiro, Heather Morgan, Nick Diapolo, Martha Greenhouse, Greg Hahn, Carey Prusa and Joseph Dolphin,  you may have heard of a little less but they are all terrific.  In fact all these people are comedians and actors I had been working with and around back in the 90s and I wrote all of their parts for them specifically.  To me, that&apos;s what this movie was for, to create performance opportunities for all my favorite funny people.  And to photograph them with prime lenses on Black and White reversal film. <em>Tomorrow Night</em> is a bizarre little indie film and it gets pretty weird.  It was a labor of love for me.  It&apos;s how I learned to direct and there are some wonderful performances in it.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The movie screened at Sundance and some other film festivals, but never got distribution... until now, after &quot;sitting in storage in film cans for 15 years.  No one has ever seen it. There are no tapes of it or even clips of it anywhere.&quot; C.K. also showed up on <em>The Daily Show</em> last night to discuss the origins of the film: </p>
