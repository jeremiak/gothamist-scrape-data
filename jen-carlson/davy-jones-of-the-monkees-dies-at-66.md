<p>Davy Jones, lead singer of The Monkees, has died at the age of 66. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521103137/http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/29/davy-jones-dead-monkees/#.T05l-nJWq-0">TMZ</a> received confirmation from an official from the medical examiner&apos;s office for Martin County, Florida, but the circumstances surrounding his death are currently unknown.</p>

<p>The Manchester, England-born singer and actor joined the Monkees in 1965, and just one year ago he was talking about a reunion. Last February Jones said, &quot;There&apos;s even talk of putting the Monkees back together again in the next year or so for a U.S. and UK tour. You&apos;re always hearing all those great songs on the radio, in commercials, movies, almost everywhere.&quot; Most recently, in 2009, Jones put out a solo album titled <em>She</em>,  a collection of classics from the 1940s through the 1970s.</p>

<p>Jones was rated the top teen idol of all time in 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521103137/http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/list-of-the-day/the-top-25-teen-idols-of-all-time.html">by Yahoo!</a>&#x2014;and not to take away from the title, but they also include Silverchair in this list? At any rate, he&apos;ll always be #1 in Marcia Brady&apos;s book:</p>

<p>Jones is survived by his wife Jessica and 4 daughters (from previous marriages).</p>
