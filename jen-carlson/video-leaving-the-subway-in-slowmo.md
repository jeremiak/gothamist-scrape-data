                            <p>Since no one slows down when rushing out of the subway, filmmakers Sarah Klein and Tom Mason have slowed things down for us. The below short film&#x2014;which they say is &quot;about that moment in New York when you emerge from the subway and find yourself in a new and sometimes unexpected world&quot;&#x2014;is part of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127073316/http://redglasspictures.com/archives/502">larger series</a> that will be filmed in London, Moscow, Paris and Hong Kong. Though they should really hit up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127073316/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/photos_swedens_stunning_subway_stat.php">Sweden&apos;s stunning underground</a>, too.</p>
