                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="legoartist0411a.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021546im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/legoartist0411a.png" width="365" height="274" class="image-left"> </span><em>We recently learned about Brooklynite Jonathan Lopes, who has recreated the borough (or some version of it) in his 400-square-foot living room. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021546/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/lego_artist_recreates_brooklyn_in_4.php">It&apos;s pretty amazing</a>, and his project is now coming to an end (he jokingly tells us he&apos;s working on adding bike lanes!). We asked Lopes a little bit about his obsession with LEGOs (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021546/http://www.mocpages.com/home.php/3284">this isn&apos;t his only project</a> involving the bricks), and what&apos;s next.</em></p>

<p><strong>What do you think of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802021546/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/01/new_nyc_lego_set_rockefeller_center.php">the LEGO kits</a> (there was a time when all you had was your imagination and the bricks!)?</strong> LEGO has put out some pretty cool and intricate kits over the past few years&#x2014;many aimed at higher age groups, but for the most part, I buy parts and use my imagination.  It is about building and creating my own models for me.  </p>

<p><strong>What will you do with piece you are working on now, once it&apos;s complete?</strong> I plan on dismantling it and probably building another.  This one is actually my second layout.</p>

<p><strong>Have you considered doing a gallery show with the landscape?</strong> Unfortunately, it can&apos;t be moved easily.  I am planning an open studio event one Saturday in May so people can come and see it in person. </p>

<p><strong>What was your biggest challenge building it?</strong> Probably finishing it once it was started.  When working without a deadline it is easy to procrastinate.  When the photographer was coming the next day, I had some hustling to do the night before to clean it up.</p>

<p><strong>How long has it been set up in your living room for?</strong> I have had this layout and the previous one in the room for about 7 years.  Fortunately, I have a large apartment and plenty of living space otherwise. When I first saw the apartment 8 or 9 years ago, I moved in because I saw this huge room and wanted it for my LEGO hobby.  The layout is 16 feet by 10 feet.<br>
 <br>
<strong>What&apos;s your next project going to be?</strong> I am currently working on building a replica of a Bond Street block between Atlantic and Pacific Streets.  I am going to display that in the Dry Cleaners when it is finished.  (Replacing the Williamsburg Savings Bank sculpture that is currently on display.)<br>
 <br>
<strong>If you could recreate one building (that you haven&apos;t already) in NYC, what would it be? Are there any landmarks or buildings that would be impossible to create via LEGOs?</strong> That&apos;s a good question. I&apos;d like to do Grand Central Station one day, but, I also tend to gravitate towards less prominent buildings as well.  (I love that triangle building at 14th street and 9th ave in the Meat Packing District, for example.)  </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything that would be impossible to create?</strong>  I don&apos;t think so.  With the right persistence and imagination (and wallet!), I feel it can all be done.  <br>
 <br>
<strong>Are there any shapes or colors of LEGOs that don&apos;t exist, that you wish did?</strong> Now and then I think of a piece or two that would be helpful and also, a wider variety of parts available in certain colors, but I enjoy the challenge and limitations of building with the parts and colors that do exist.</p>
