<p>Usually we&apos;re used to hearing about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141600/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/confirmed_gowanus_canal_can_give_yo.php">cancer</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141600/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">gonorrhea</a> being found in the Gowanus Canal... so this is refreshing. According to the Brooklyn Paper several old sunken vessels have been discovered in the waters, via an EPA sonar reading. One is reportedly a 60-foot-long hull of a wooden vessel that could date back to the 18th century, when the waterway was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141600/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/flashback_gowanus_canal.php">an industrial highway</a>.</p>

<p>Archeologist John Vetter says, &#x201C;It looks like it might have been a working boat&quot; that&apos;s &quot;at least 50 years old, but likely far older.&quot; Parts of barges and smaller boats have also been spotted through the technology, as well as a &#x201C;mysterious U-shaped object between the Union and Carroll Street bridges.&quot; More analysis on the objects could reveal more in coming months, and if anything historically significant is found it will be preserved. Even if it has gonorrhea.</p>

<p>One day, our children&apos;s children will discover this DIY &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141600/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/08/is_this_diy_art_boat_in_gowanus_rea.php">sculptural rivercraft</a>&quot; submerged at the bottom of the canal... and judge us all.</p>
