										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="philpizza0211a.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113134547im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/philpizza0211a.jpg" width="365" height="302" class="image-right"> </span>Is everyone excited for Phil Collins Day? It&apos;s right around the corner, so hopefully you picked up your Phil pinata. If your bosses are Genesis fans they probably gave you the day off, in which case there is only one place to be:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;For the past five years or so, Brooklyn has had the opportunity to celebrate the man, the legend, that is Phil. Every February 15, Phil is honored and adored by various events that have taken place throughout the borough. Whether it be giant pinatas, Phil&apos;s face on a pizza, outdoor movies in the cold, or a mass tagging of Phil&apos;s face around town, there has always been a celebration. This year is no exception. 

<p>I&apos;d like to welcome all of you to the first annual Phil Collins Day Parade. February 15. There will be floats, dancers, a marching band, and tunes, Parading down Franklin St. in Greenpoint.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p></p>

<p>Following the Phil parade, the celebration will continue with famous clips, songs, and the Phil Collins cocktail at Shayz Lounge (130 Franklin Street, Brooklyn). Look for more information in our newsletter next week! As we&apos;re still trying to figure out if this is really a thing. (Please be a thing.)</p>
