Well, hopefully you are drinking coffee to counteract it, and not watching television (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522083518/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704055104574652340708172608.html">will also kill you</a>).<p></p>

<p>The site notes that &quot;too much sitting, and not just a lack of exercise, may cause heart disease and other life-threatening illnesses. The more time people spend in a completely sedentary state, independent of the exercise they get at other times, the higher their risk of becoming obese, and developing diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&quot; As bloggers, this is particularly disheartening news. Should we start working standing up, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522083518/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A946-2004Jun23.html">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, or get real jobs?</p>
