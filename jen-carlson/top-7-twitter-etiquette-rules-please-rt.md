<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="newtwittiquette05.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523183248im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newtwittiquette05.jpeg" width="640" height="466" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We&apos;re going to wrap up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523183248/http://gothamist.com/tags/nationaletiquetteweek">National Etiquette Week</a> with some rules on how to compose yourself on Twitter. Listen, it&apos;s <em>your</em> Twitter feed, and you can do with it what you want, and we don&apos;t like it when people tell us how to act either, but we&apos;re gonna put this out there. All we ask is that you RT it, and Tweet it at some celebrities, and then #FF us. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, they&apos;re just some suggestions that you can take or leave but we stand by them and will unfollow you if you break any of these rules. Yes, even you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523183248/https://twitter.com/#!/ann___LO">grandma Ann</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Do not ReTweet your own Follow Fridays. Like, if someone #FFs you, that&apos;s great for you, all of your hard work curating your Twitter feed has finally paid off. Validation! But no one cares that someone included you in their #FF. Yes, even if that someone is famous-ish.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Do not ReTweet other people&apos;s Tweets where they are complimenting you. You are better than that.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> There is almost never a good reason to @ celebrities. So, just don&apos;t. And if you &quot;must,&quot; don&apos;t make a habit of it. It&apos;s creepy.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Do not Tweet every single Foursquare check-in (particularly when you check in to the gym or yoga studio, those make us feel bad). And don&apos;t use that weird program that Tweets your weight out to all of your followers each week (but congrats on losing 5 lbs, must have been all those gym check-ins we read about).</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Are you making plans with a friend on Twitter? Then we&apos;re guessing you have their email address or phone number, both are much more appropriate channels through which to make plans. (But <em>definitely</em> get that fried clam special at that restaurant tonight&#x2014;SO GOOD, see the 18 Instagram photos we Tweeted of it.)</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Do not ask people to &quot;Please RT.&quot; If people want to RT something they will. People have free will, we don&apos;t care what Spinoza essays you read in college.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Do you have Summer Fridays? We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523183248/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/people_working_on_summer_fridays_we.php">don&apos;t want to hear about it</a>. Discretion is the better part of entitlement. And while we&apos;re at it: if you&apos;re on vacation, that&apos;s terrific! But we&apos;re capping your enviable vacation Tweets at a <em>generous</em> 3 per day. One of them should feature you wearing an embarrassing hat with a bad sunburn. </p>
