title: Vintage Skateboarding Video Shows NYC In The 1980s
---

<p>The skateboarding craze hit New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322171757/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/25/flashback_when_the_skateboarding_cr.php#photo-1">in the 1960s</a>, but some of the best footage of locals taking their boards to the street is from the 1980s, when the man wasn&apos;t really paying attention&#x2014;it wasn&apos;t until the spring 1996 that the city council passed Local Law 1996/043, making it illegal to skate &quot;recklessly.&quot; Below is a video from 1985, that captures a lot of great 1980s New York City streetscapes&#x2014;keep an eye out for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322171757/http://espn.go.com/action/bmx/news/story?id=4620354">Brooklyn Bridge banks</a>.</p>

<p>The uploader of the video (which is from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322171757/http://www.skatevideosonline.net/video/66/powell-peralta/future-primitive/">Future Primitive</a> DVD) writers, &quot;In the 80s, this is what street skating was often like: just a bunch of guys ripping down the street, crashing into things and generally having a blast. Along with the Bones Brigade, that&apos;s Christian Hosoi in there with the green hair, along with Dave Hackett (acid-dropping off a semi truck), Ian Frahm (ollieing up onto the wall at the Brooklyn Bridge banks&#x2014;big trick at the time) and some other NYC locals.&quot;</p>
