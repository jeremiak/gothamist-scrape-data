<p>The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus is coming to Brooklyn soon, and in anticipation the company will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326041556/http://gothamist.com/tags/elephantwalk">showing off their elephants</a> once again. Paging PETA! The &quot;Greatest Show On Earth&quot; has been criticized for their treatment of the elephants before, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326041556/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/22/peta_has_video_of_ringling_bros_bea.php">damning footage</a> has been released showing inhumane treatment from trainers. But the show will go on... and this Wednesday at 11 a.m. the elephants will take part in a dance party.</p>

<p>Earlier today we were told by a Ringling rep that &quot;the elephant walk for Brooklyn... is going to be an Elephant Dance Party with the elephants and performers, as well as Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz.&quot; It will take place under the Brooklyn Bridge. The rep would not elaborate on what exactly an elephant dance party entails, nor was it clear how the elephants would get from the rave to the Barclays Center. From the press release:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;To commemorate its inaugural performances at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey will host a community event in DUMBO. As part of the festivities, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz will issue a proclamation announcing that March 20 - April 1 will be &apos;Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Days&apos; in Brooklyn. The DUMBO event will also showcase exciting performers from Ringling Bros. &#x2014;including basketball unicyclists, King Charles Troupe and world-famous Ringling Bros. clowns.   If that weren&#x2019;t enough, the most popular &apos;dancing divas&apos; on the planet will astound as Ringling Bros. epic Asian elephants show off fresh and classic dance moves to contemporary music reflecting each elephant&#x2019;s unique talent and personality.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The circus will be taking over Barclays Center on March 20th. Performances just ended at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, where they held an Elephant Walk on the 9th of this month.</p>
