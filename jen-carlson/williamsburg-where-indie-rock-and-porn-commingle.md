<p>Aspiring actors, look now further than the Morgan L stop in Williamsburg for your big break! This flier advertises casting for a little film called: &quot;Niki Gets Lost In BushDick.&quot; The plot is pretty simple: Niki stumbles upon a band whilst wandering around &quot;BushDick&quot; and (to put it mildly) ends up &quot;sleeping with&quot; them, all, at once. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617005245/http://copyranter.blogspot.com/2008/05/xxx-movie-seeking-band-of-horses-in.html">Copyranter</a> guesses that the band must be indie rock; perhaps some real life Brooklyn band porn names are in order. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617005245/http://www.myspace.com/yeasayer">Yeah, Say Her</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617005245/http://www.myspace.com/thexyzaffair">The XXX Affair</a>? Either way, can&apos;t wait for the soundtrack!</p>
