<p>On Wednesday we <em>thought</em> Shepard Fairey&apos;s mural on Houston Street was pretty much done, but it wasn&apos;t... until now! We&apos;re told sometime around 9 p.m. last night the piece was completed... but it really doesn&apos;t look much different <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130629/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/shepard_faireys_mural_is_now_done.php">from Wednesday&apos;s shot</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, check out some video from the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130629/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/shepard_faireys_mural_is_now_done.php">here</a>, and stay tuned for Fairey&apos;s Deitch show in May, as well as a pop-up shop for OBEY clothing which will open on the LES. Speaking of clothing lines, we know the mural is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130629/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/22/cops_protecting_street_art_from_str.php">target for vandals</a>, but what is the deal with that target in the middle... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130629/http://www.target.com/">synergy</a>?</p>
