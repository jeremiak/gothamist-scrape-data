										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="aapparel0210.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132837im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/aapparel0210.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="image-left"> </span>Last Saturday a group of feminist protesters stood strong outside of an American Apparel store in NoHo, chanting things like, &#x201C;Women&#x2019;s bodies are a battleground,&#x201D; &#x201C;Women as sex toys&#x2014;no more!&#x201D; and &#x201C;We need total revolution!&#x201D; The rally was part of &#x201C;From the Burkha to the Thong: Everything Must, and Can Change&#x2014;We Need Total Revolution,&#x201D; Sunsara Taylor&apos;s speaking tour, which was just at NYU.</p>

<p>Taylor (a self-described &#x201C;controversial young communist&quot;) and her crew chastised the company for their &quot;Search for the Best Bottom in the World&quot; contest; 28-year-old protester Alice Woodward told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132837/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_356/rearguard.html">the Villager</a> it delivers a message that women are merely &quot;disembodied butts and boobs.&quot; When confronted with the fact that the company is also searching for the best <em>boy</em> bottoms, they said they are against disembodied butts, in general.</p>

<p>Anyway, as you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132837/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/todaysad.jpg">in today&apos;s advertisement</a>, these classy American Apparel ladies are buttoned up to the top with oxford shirts and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132837/http://store.americanapparel.net/rsakwcnw.html">unisex knit crew necks</a>! Just because they want to get comfy in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132837/http://store.americanapparel.net/rsals324.html">spandex lace unitard</a> and assume the doggy-style position after a long day at the library or wherever, doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re being objectified. And definitely not by that gentleman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108132837/http://gothamist.com/tags/dovcharney">Dov Charney</a>!</p>
