										<p>Back in June Gothamist&apos;s favorite radio station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143113/http://www.kexp.org/">KEXP</a>, came for a week long visit as it broadcasted live out of the Museum of Television &amp; Radio. At that time we had a chance to sit and chat with morning deejay extroidanaire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143113/http://kexp.org/programming/djpage.asp?DJID=279&amp;1413=38262.75-1&amp;96=38262.75-1&amp;20=38262.75-1&amp;256=38262.75-2">John Richards</a>. Very (very) early in the morning, mind you. We also got a chance to catch some great bands in the intimate in-studio performance space. KEXP never ceases to amaze us with what it can pull off with no commercial sponsorship, and that&apos;s why we love it and we want to tell you more about it...so read about our chat with the man himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143113/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/archives/2004/06/16/johnin_the_morning.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next week KEXP and John are back in town for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143113/http://cmj.com/marathon">CMJ</a> and more broadcasts from the MTR. We want to make sure you know all about the events they&apos;ll be sponsoring... </p>

(Imagine seeing the Decemberists or Sufjan Stevens in a tiny little space with a few dozen others!)</p>

<p>Don&apos;t miss the KEXP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143113/http://kexp.org/images/events/lit_flyer.jpg">Listener Party</a> with one hour open bar and James Iha spinning tunes.</p>

<p>And of course there&apos;s a number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143113/http://kexp.org/events/special.asp">showcases</a> (you know, it being the week of CMJ and all) that you can check out as well. </p>

<p>Can&apos;t wait until next week for the music orgy that is CMJ? Let the sound invade your ears and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143113/http://kexp-web-2.cac.washington.edu:8000/listen.pls">listen to KEXP now</a>!</p>
