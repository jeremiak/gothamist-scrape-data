<p>Perhaps submarines are always in the East River, just, you know, submerged--but we&apos;ve never seen one. Until now! This one just floated through DUMBO headed in the direction of Williamsburg. So if you&apos;re a hipster wearing your &quot;Defend Brooklyn&quot; T-shirt, the day has come to back it up!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We have been told that this was indeed the Growler submarine, &quot;one of the exhibits from the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum - being tugged up the East River today, on its way to GMD Shipyard Corp. facilities at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Growler is in dry dock for a hull scrape, some minor exterior repairs and a full, historically accurate paint job that will see the sides painted grey and the top (the part that&apos;s visible above water) painted black.&quot;</p>

<p>She will then be towed back by four tug boats to Pier 86 in time for the November 8 reopening of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. And the Intrepid returns to Manhattan after a nearly two-year refurbishment project on October 2nd!</p>
