title: Photos: A New Yorker Has Been Writing A Story IN The Snow
---

	
										<p>At least someone is turning all of this snow into an opportunity&#x2014;Shelley Jackson has been writing a story in the white stuff since the end of January. The story is delivered through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151808/http://instagram.com/snowshelleyjackson">her Instagram account</a>, where each photo contains one word beautifully handwritten in the snow, and there are multiple updates every time we get hit with it. To read it all, you&apos;ll have to  scroll down to the bottom and read right to left and upwards&#x2014;she says it&apos;s a &quot;story in progress, weather permitting.&quot; No spoilers, but these are the first three words...</p>
