<p>Two years after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308232339/http://gothamist.com/2006/06/27/boy_george_must.php">pleading guilty</a> to falsely calling in a break-in and donning an orange Department of Sanitation vest while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308232339/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/14/boy_george_swee.php">sweeping the streets of Chinatown</a> (as part of his community service duty), Boy George has announced he&apos;ll play a private show for the NYC Department of Sanitation workers later this summer. From the press release:</p><blockquote>Boy George will help celebrate New York City&#x2019;s Department of Sanitation Family Day this summer!  George will be playing a free concert as a big thank you for the kindness shown to him by the DSNY.  On August 17th he will play all his Culture Club hits and more for a crowd of over 5,000 NYC Sanitation workers and their families at DSNY Family Day.</blockquote>New York&apos;s Strongest said they are delighted at the gesture and &quot;welcome his generous offer to entertain those who have made our City the cleanest it has been in more than 30 years.&#x201D; This is the 4th annual DoS family outing, and each year it consists of a picnic and entertainment at the Department of Sanitation training facility in Brooklyn. <p></p>

<p>Fans who aren&apos;t in the DoS can check out George three days prior, when he&apos;ll play Terminal 5 as part of his first solo tour in a decade (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308232339/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/00004091C1DD5307?artistid=734630&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1">tickets available here</a>).
