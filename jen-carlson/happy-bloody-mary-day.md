TGI Friday&apos;s will roll back drink prices to 1933 levels (99 cents). A little history: &quot;The cocktail was originally called the &apos;Red Snapper&apos; because the term bloody was considered harsh for a drink in the 1930s. When Tabasco sauce was added to the drink the name &apos;Bloody Mary&apos; became a household word. In the 1960s it became popular to serve the cocktail with celery due to a guest at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago.&quot;</p>
