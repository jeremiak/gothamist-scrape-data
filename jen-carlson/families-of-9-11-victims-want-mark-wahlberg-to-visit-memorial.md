<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128164302/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/911_wouldnt_have_happened_if_mark_w.php">Earlier this week</a> Mark Wahlberg&apos;s interview with Men&apos;s Journal revealed that the actor fancies himself a real life action hero. He told the magazine that he was scheduled to be on one of the planes that flew into the Twin Towers on September 11th, adding: &quot;If I was on that plane with my kids, it wouldn&apos;t have went down like it did. There would have been a lot of blood in that first-class cabin and then me saying,&apos;OK, we&#x2019;re going to land somewhere safely, don&apos;t worry.&apos;&quot; The only thing that could have made this worse is if he were actually developing a movie where his character single-handedly stopped 9/11 from happening (<em>maybe he is?</em>). Anyway, he has since apologized, but the relatives of the victims killed on 9/11 want him to show up to the memorial in person. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128164302/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/pay_respects_at_memorial_mark_kin_A9BEA6KQW5lxJpkNYPgT7L">the NY Post</a>, they believe he should visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128164302/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/12/opening_day_at_the_national_911_mem.php#photo-1">9/11 Memorial</a> and help get the 9/11 museum open on schedule. Monica Iken, whose husband was killed that day, told the paper, &#x201C;He should take this as a lesson learned to do something positive. He is in a position to help. He should just be happy he wasn&#x2019;t on the plane and focus on what he can do, now that he&#x2019;s overcome it.&quot;</p>

<p>Others believe if he simply made a publicized trip to the memorial it would help with donations... and it probably couldn&apos;t hurt Wahlberg&apos;s image, either. We&apos;re sure his PR team is mocking up the perfect photo ops right now.</p>
