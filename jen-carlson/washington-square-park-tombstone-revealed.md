<p>Perhaps it would have been nice to have had the mystery of the Washington Square Park tombstone prolonged until Halloween, but the case has seemingly been cracked! In just under a week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510214838/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/26/washington_square_park.php">the unearthed tombstone</a> has been dusted off and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510214838/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/gravestone-from-1799-is-found-in-washington-square-park/">the NY Times</a> reports, belongs to one James Jackson who died in September of 1799.</p>

<p>The New-York Historical Society believes that he resided at 19 East George Street (the  former name of Market Street), and was a watchman and grocer. They say, &#x201C;There are many fewer Jacksons than I would have expected in the directory. Chances are this is him.&quot; It&apos;s suspected he may have died from yellow fever, which was rampant in the city at the time.</p>

<p>The inscription on the stone, which was just 2 1/2 feet underground, reads: &#x201C;Here lies the body of James Jackson, who departed this life the 22nd day of September 1799 aged 28 years native of the county of Kildare Ireland.&#x201D; And while the body hasn&apos;t been found yet (it may have been moved when the area was developed), parks commissioner Adrian Benepe declares: &#x201C;They&#x2019;re going to try to unravel the mystery of James Jackson and how the headstone came to be there,&quot; as well as find his body.</p>

<p>An archaeological consultant for the parks department told the paper that finding a headstone in the area is &quot;very unusual. In fact, I&#x2019;m stunned.&#x201D; While it was a potter&apos;s field (which wouldn&apos;t have contained headstones), the park also was the grounds for at least one church cemetery, as the Inside the Apple folks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510214838/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/27/wsp_tombstone_the_sequel.php">stated yesterday</a>.</p>
