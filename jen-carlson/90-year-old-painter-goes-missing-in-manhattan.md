Stefanelli, one of the New York School Abstract Expressionist artists, has disappeared after dropping his wife off at NYU Medical Center, authorities say. The 90-year-old suffers from dementia and wandered off near the East 30th Street hospital, where his wife was receiving treatment. This occurred yesterday, and he&apos;s still nowhere to be found; according to the NY Post, police don&apos;t suspect foul play. </p>

<p>The artist lives on West Street in the West Village, and police say he&apos;s 5-foot-4 and about 140 lbs. He was wearing a dark hat, a tan jacket and tan pants, when he was last seen. If you have any information you can call the NYPD&apos;s tipline at (800) 577-TIPS.</p>
