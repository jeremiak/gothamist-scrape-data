<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731065335/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay-Z</a> is trying to obtain approval to perform atop the Ed Sullivan Theater marquee next month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731065335/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD8o_CmQAj8">just like Phish did in 2004</a>. (As it happens, Phish rocked the marquee three days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731065335/http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2004-06-18">Jay-Z joined the band</a> during their concert on Coney Island.) And according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731065335/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jay_is_ready_to_jam_midtown_L9XIJ5Cp2L3DYb1oILc4kI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">the NY Post</a>&#x2014;who are calling it a &quot;surprise concert&quot; even though they mention the July 8th date&#x2014;he&apos;s close to getting approval. </p>

<p>A law enforcement official told the paper, &#x201C;If he gets permission from the mayor&#x2019;s office, it&#x2019;s going to be off the hook. They&#x2019;ll have to shut down Broadway around the Letterman building. They&#x2019;ll have to have a strong police presence. It&#x2019;s going to be chaos with so many fans.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In 2010, Mayor Bloomberg pulled the plug on Jay-Z and Eminem when they planned to perform on the same marquee&#x2014;they ended up moving their concert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731065335/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/21/jay-z_is_performing_outdoors_tonigh.php">to the roof</a>.</p>
