title: Is The Carrie Diaries Portraying 1980s NYC All Wrong?

<p>Last week the <em>Sex and the City</em> prequel&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010029/http://gothamist.com/tags/thecarriediaries"><em>The Carrie Diaries</em></a>&#x2014;aired its series premiere. The show starts out set in 1984, with a young Carrie Bradshaw splitting her time between high school and home in Connecticut and a day job in Manhattan (which she earns school credit for). The show is, of course, sprinkled with inaccuracies, with a team that seems dead-set on recreating a Lisa Frank-style 1980s. But despite playing The Talking Heads&apos; &quot;And She Was&quot; in Carrie&apos;s world a year before it was even written by David Byrne in the real world, they seem to think they&apos;re portraying New York, and the decade, <em>accurately</em>.</p>

<p>At least, that&apos;s what their recent takeover of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010029/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">The Hotel Chelsea</a> would suggest. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010029/http://legends.typepad.com/">One resident</a> at the hotel, which is currently and controversially being transformed by new management, told us the show has been shooting there this week, adding: &quot;I was surprised that the Hotel management would want to curtail their construction activities for even one day. <strong>The stairwell walls were painted purple on three floors.  Additionally they hung up some really idiotic art.  Everybody who lived here duing the 80s will tell you the walls weren&apos;t staircase walls weren&apos;t purple... the two big inaccuracies would be that the stairwell walls were white and there weren&apos;t any paintings hanging on the walls in the stairwell</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see the real 1980s stairwell at the six minute mark here:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s a shot that our tipster sent over of the purple walls and art:</p>

<p>Yes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010029/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">it&apos;s fiction</a>, but won&apos;t someone think of the children who are being spoonfed a colorful, fictional 1980s New York City? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010029/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php#photo-1">Where are the <em>bad old days</em></a>? Where&apos;s the ghost of Nancy Spungen?</p>
