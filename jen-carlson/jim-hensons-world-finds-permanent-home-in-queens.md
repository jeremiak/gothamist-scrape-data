<p>Over the past few years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140012/http://www.movingimage.us/">the Museum of the Moving Image</a> in Queens has had some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140012/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/13/in_which_we_enter_jim_hensons_fanta.php">spectacular Jim Henson installations</a>, and this morning they announced that they&apos;ll now be a permanent home to his characters (at least, the ones who don&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140012/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/visiting_sesame_street.php#photo-1">live on Sesame Street</a>).</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg (who once had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140012/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/you_now_have_until_march_to_visit_m.php">his own muppet in the museum</a>) announced today: &quot;It&#x2019;s only fitting that this extraordinary collection of puppets, costumes, props, and more should find a home in New York, where imagination and free expression are part of the fabric of our city, and where anyone who&#x2019;s watched an episode of <em>Sesame Street</em> sees the inspiration provided by the vibrant neighborhoods and characters that make our city so extraordinary.&quot;</p>

<p>Cheryl Henson, daughter of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140012/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/muppets_co-creator_jane_henson.php">the late Jane</a> and Jim Henson, was also on hand today, and added: &#x201C;Our fondness for this city and its institutions is deeply rooted as NYC was home for The Jim Henson Company for many years and is now for the Jim Henson Workshop in Long Island City.&quot;</p>

<p>The museum will create a 2,200-square-foot gallery (expected to open in the winter of 2014/2015) devoted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140012/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimhenson">the late puppeteer</a>&apos;s work, and recently received a gift of nearly 400 puppets, costumes and props. They include &quot;artifacts representing every major film and television production on which Henson played a key creative role during his lifetime,&quot;&#x2014;everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140012/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/kermit_the_lizard.php"><em>Sam and Friends</em></a> to <em>The Muppet Show</em> to <em>Sesame Street</em> to <em>Fraggle Rock</em> to <em>The Dark Crystal</em>, and <em>Labyrinth</em>.</p>
