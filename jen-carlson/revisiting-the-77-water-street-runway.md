</div></div>					<p>Earlier today a reader responded to our call for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://beta.gothamist.com/2011/02/17/unique_living_spaces.php">unique living spaces</a> with a very unusual space, just not one you would live in. The space is the roof 77 Water Street in Manhattan, where a plane <em>and</em> runway are situated. We took a look at this via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=77+water+street+new+york&amp;aq=&amp;sll=40.704172,-74.008076&amp;sspn=0.000706,0.001825&amp;gl=us&amp;g=Hanover+Square,+New+York+10005&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=77+Water+St,+New+York,+10005&amp;ll=40.704138,-74.008123&amp;spn=0.001411,0.00365&amp;t=h&amp;z=19">Google maps</a> way back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/24/more_fun_with_g.php">in 2006</a>, but something so neat is worth revisiting. The reader also tells us, &quot;at night, from the neighboring buildings you can see that it actually has functioning runway lights.  It&#x2019;s very strange.&quot; (A view of the scene from a neighboring building can be see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://www.flickr.com/photos/phrenologist/31351067/in/photostream/">here</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://www.nyc-architecture.com/LM/LM028-77WATERSTREET.htm">The biplane</a> &quot;was designed by some guy named Rudolph de Harak and executed by the sculptor William Tarr in 1969,&quot; and according to the book <em>New York 1960, Architecture and Urbanism Between the Second World War and the Bicentennial</em>, it&apos;s a World War I Sopwith Camel fighter plane, set up there &quot;solely for the delight of denizens of neighboring skyscrapers.&quot; One know-it-all on this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/print.main?id=2493745">aviation message board</a> explains why it&apos;s only for fun, and not function&#x2014;noting, it &quot;isn&apos;t even wide enough for that plane. Besides, it isn&apos;t even 50m long. And it is green. Not even this special Pilatus plane could start or land on that.&quot; (What&apos;s wrong with <em>green</em>?)</p>

<p>A more recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://www.observer.com/2010/commercial-observer/%E2%80%98no-nonsense%E2%80%99-and-sopwith-camel">Observer</a> article about the building itself, they claim that it&apos;s unclear &quot;for whom exactly [the plane] was intended... certainly not for the public, who never saw it, or for the employees who had no access to the roof.&quot; They also report it&apos;s been there for four decades&#x2014;so it did crossover when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/09/ny_airways.php">there were <em>real</em> planes</a> taking off from buildings.</p>

<p>If you know of any more secret rooftop spots out there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">let us know</a>... because we&apos;re sort of obsessed with viewing these things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184309/http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;ss=77%20water%20street%20ny%20ny&amp;cp=40.70548~-74.007596&amp;style=o&amp;lvl=2&amp;scene=1679034&amp;sp=adr.77%20Water%20St%2c%20New%20York%2c%20NY%2010005">like this</a> right now.</p>
