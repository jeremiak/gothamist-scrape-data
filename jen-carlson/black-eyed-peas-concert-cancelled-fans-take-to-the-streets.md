<p>As you may have guessed, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726224426/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/02/black_eyed_peas_to_play_massive_fre.php">Black Eyed Peas</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726224426/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/warning_black_eyed_peas_and_taylor.php">Taylor Swift</a>) concert that was supposed to go down tonight in Central Park has been cancelled&#x2014;you can blame, or thank, the weather, and possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726224426/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/extra_extra_1960.php">a higher power</a>. The event was expected to draw around 60,000 people, and was scheduled to start around 7:30 p.m.; at first it was delayed, but as the skies opened up after 8 p.m., the plug was officially pulled. Another silver lining to the concert being cancelled aside from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726224426/http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=black+eyed+peas&amp;aq=f">none of these songs</a> tainting the historic park: this amazing photo of devastated Black Eyed Peas fans running head on into traffic!</p>

<p>No word yet on if the show will be postponed, but Taboo (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726224426/http://www.hulu.com/watch/221673/saturday-night-live-our-time-with-taboo-and-apldeap">heh</a>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140726224426/http://twitter.com/#!/TabBep/status/78988711521558528">Tweeted</a> around 9 p.m., &quot;Fergie is really sorry it&apos;s not happening we feel horrible .. We are devastated and Fergie told me to tweet this she loves u all.&quot;</p>
