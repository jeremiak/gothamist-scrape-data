title: NYC Destruction Porn: New Cloverfield Trailer
---

	
										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144930/http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/11808/large.html">new trailer</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144930/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277"><em>Cloverfield</em></a> (the JJ Abrams movie due out in January) has been released, and only proves a tad more revealing than the first. With a giant monster destroying New York City, this movie will certainly be for those who like &quot;destruction porn,&quot; because nothing really beats the Statue of Liberty being decapitated...  </p>

<p>Abrams turned the Lower East Side into a war zone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144930/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/01/abrams.php">earlier this year</a>, but he&apos;s been hush-hush about any details surrounding the project. Looks like everyone will see their neighborhood in shambles though, as much of New York seems to be covered -- it even begins on a future date in Coney Island, and the main characters make it all the way up to incident site U.S. 447 (the area formerly known as Central Park...creepy!). </p>

<p>Catch the trailer before all screenings of <em>Beowulf</em> <em>except</em> the IMAX. (The preview for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144930/http://imdb.com/title/tt0067525/"><em>Omega Man</em></a>-do-over <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144930/http://imdb.com/title/tt0480249/">I Am Legend</a></em> is currently screening in IMAX.) Below is a photo from the film (we&apos;re guessing the subway had delays) and a drawing of what the Cloverfield monster may look like (hey, that hipster is as tall as Lady Liberty!). </p>
