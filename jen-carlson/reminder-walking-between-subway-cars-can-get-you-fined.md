<p>A Reddit poster put up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005001/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/oru78/psa_got_a_75_ticket_for_walking_between_subway/">a PSA on the site</a>, simply stating: &quot;Got a $75 ticket for walking between subway cars.&quot; Yep, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005001/http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/index.html">them&apos;s the rules</a> (it&apos;s in violation to &quot;move between end doors of a subway car whether or not train is in motion, except in an emergency or when directed by police officer or conductor&quot;). And those doors are often left <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005001/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/17/pol_wants_subway_doors_unlocked.php">unlocked</a>... making it so very tempting to the subway scofflaw.</p>

<p>The fine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005001/http://gothamist.com/2005/05/31/subway_house_rules.php">is 75 bucks</a>, and as the poster notes, if you don&apos;t mail it in you have to go to the MTA arbitration in Brooklyn to pay in person, you can also request a hearing to dispute it. </p>

<p>When the walking between cars rule was put into effect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005001/http://gothamist.com/2005/06/28/new_subway_rules_of_conduct_adopted.php">in 2005</a>, the city admitted, &quot;It is, from time to time, convenient to absent oneself from a car or from a particular group of people.&quot; So, why else do people walk between cars, when it can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005001/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/16/yesterday_a_man.php">so very dangerous</a>? Let&apos;s turn to the Reddit board! Here is what some people posted about the illegal activity:</p><ul><li>All I know is every time I see someone walk between cars, they intend to somehow disrupt my commute.<br>
</li><li>People pee while standing between the cars.<br>
</li><li>I&apos;ve gone between the cars exactly 3 times. And all three times it was to vomit because I was sickly drunk.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Of course, there are some more reasons, like getting away from someone, or some <em>smell</em>, or fleeing the car because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005001/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/subway_11.php">a group of annoying teenagers</a> are on it, or because you <em>are</em> a teenager and that&apos;s just what you do.</p>

<p>But wait a second, are you guys really peeing in between subway cars?</p>
