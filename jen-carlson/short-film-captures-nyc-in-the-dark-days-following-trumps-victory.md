<p>In the days following Donald Trump&apos;s victory, many of us grappled with alternating waves of grief, nausea, rage and defiance. Amidst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201114631/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/trump_clinton_election_nightmare.php">the weeping</a> and screaming, we also attempted to go about our normal daily lives in the wake of the horrifying election night results. Filmmaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201114631/http://gothamist.com/tags/colbymoore">Colby Moore</a> roamed the streets, he tells us, trying &quot;to capture the unusual and surreal atmosphere of those first few nights after the election as everyday New Yorkers began to come to grips with a sudden new reality.&quot;</p>

<p>Below is the result, titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201114631/https://vimeo.com/192537995">Midnight in America</a>,&quot; which shows New Yorkers doing their damn thing. Moore says this was &quot;shot mostly around midtown and on UWS with a few shots down in Union Square,&quot; where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201114631/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/subway_therapy_messages.php#photo-1">the Post-It wall</a> makes a cameo.</p>
