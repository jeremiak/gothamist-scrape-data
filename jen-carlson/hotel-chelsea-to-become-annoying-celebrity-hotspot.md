According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194504/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/balazs_wants_chelsea_next_X18M3gI1mMqFA9K98T9V5N?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Page Six</a> the hotelier was spotted in the lobby and meeting with management last week (he&apos;s eyed the place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194504/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/22/balazs.php">in the past</a>, too). </p>

<p>Some are speculating that Balazs, who also owns The Standard, &quot;plans to give it the same magic touch he gave the Chateau Marmont when he transformed the Hollywood rock haven into a posh hangout for celebrities and LA elite.&quot; Which one do you think will sleep with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194504/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/28/dylan_thomas_is_baaaaack.php">the ghost of Dylan Thomas</a> first?!</p>
