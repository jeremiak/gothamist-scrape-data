										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516223012/http://www.hsus.org/">The Humane Society</a> writes in to alert us of the latest act of cruelty against NYC&apos;s carriage horses. &quot;While airplanes were grounded on last Friday, Dec 19th during the snowstorm, the city&#x2019;s horse carriages continued operation. Forcing animals to work in such oppressive weather conditions is cruel and this is just the tip of the abuse associated with the carriage horse industry.&quot; The footage was posted by filmmaker Donny Moss, who directed <em>Blinders</em>.</p>

<p>They added that &quot;Over a year has passed since City Comptroller William Thompson documented in an independent audit the inhumane conditions the horses live and work under, yet the abuse continues. The Humane Society of the United States and our more than 217,000 members and supporters in New York City urge the City Council to shut this industry down.&quot; Last month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516223012/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/20/petas_anticarriage_horse_campaign.php">PETA launched a new campaign</a> against the industry as well.</p>
