If regular midwestern pizza resembles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150829234752/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/deep_dish_pizza_nyc.php">a casserole</a>, this is more like a calzone... or or or: cal<em>dome</em>?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150829234752/http://www.sheboyganpress.com/article/20140217/SHE0101/302170360/Aspen-Landing-makes-volcano-out-pizza?nclick_check=1">the Sheboygan Press</a>, Nora Asplund and Kim Moutsopoulosare of Aspen Landing restaurant are now serving Volcano pizza. </p>

<p>The abomination comes in one size, but with up to three toppings the price is right at $10.95. Kim describes it as such: &quot;<strong>It&#x2019;s a double-crusted pizza with a dome. When we take it to the table, we cut a little hole in it and ignite it with some alcohol. After it burns out, we remove the dome</strong> and that is served with our homemade marinara sauce for dipping. Underneath is a normal pizza, already cooked to order.&quot; Here&apos;s what that looks like, from a restaurant in Bali that seems to be known for it: </p>
