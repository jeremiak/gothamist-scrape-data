<p>With Craigslist becoming ever-increasingly creepy, this smitten young man has gone and purchased his own URL to find the girl he ogled on the subway last night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160402/http://www.nygirlofmydreams.com/">NYGirlOfMyDreams.com</a> has a simple mission, it&apos;s &quot;skinny, tall, not insane&quot; creator would like to meet the the &quot;fancy-braided, rosy-cheeked, journal writing&quot; girl he saw on the the 5 train at 9:30pm last night. And if it doesn&apos;t work out, we&apos;re sure he has that URL for at least a year, and we expect to see a rotating cast of illustrated girls he&apos;s fallen for underground.</p>

<p>Can&apos;t wait to see this play out on the big screen, we&apos;re thinking John Krasinski and Natalie Portman or Ryan Gosling and Zooey Deschanel as the leads.</p>

<p>Update: According to this lad&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160402/http://www.flickr.com/photos/patrickmoberg/1812347423">Flickr account</a>, he was at the Apes &amp; Androids show on Halloween...so he can&apos;t be all that bad.</p>
