<p>It sounds like a Project Runway challenge: create a look Princess Grace would have worn. However, the six gowns that are currently being displayed in the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue were created by some of the top designers -- each being paired with a specific look to be reinterpreted in a modern way.</p>

<p>To help mark the 25th anniversary of her death, and to raise money for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175551/http://www.pgfusa.org/">the Princess Grace Foundation USA</a> (which funds theatrical and dance scholarships), the gowns will be auctioned off after they&apos;re shown off this week. Designers asked to put their own touch on a unique look: Carolina Herrera, Zac Posen, Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren, Ralph Rucci and Vera Wang. Herrera reinterpreted the above Edith Head-design dress, which Kelly wore during her role as Lisa Carol Fremont in <em>Rear Window</em> -- see her version on display <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175551/http://www.flickr.com/photos/aloha_pineapple/1700675164">here</a>. Through tomorrow you can also visit a free exhibit at Sotheby&apos;s called &quot;Grace, Princess of Monaco: A Tribute to the Life and Legacy of Grace Kelly.&apos;&apos; More details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175551/http://www.visitmonaco.com/mtny/home.htm">here</a>, and more images of the gowns on display <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175551/http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/acelebrationofgrace/">here</a>. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175551/http://www.1010wins.com/Gowns-Honoring-Grace-Kelly-Displayed-in-NYC/1125146">statement</a>,  Maguy Maccario Doyle (consul general of Monaco) recalls the style of the Princess <em>and</em> actress: &quot;As Grace Kelly the actress, she gave us some of the most glamorous and stylish moments in cinematic history and as Princess of Monaco she was equally elegant and inspiring.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s not surprising these tributes are taking place in New York, Kelly had many ties to the city. She was living in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175551/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbizon_Hotel_for_Women">Barbizon Hotel for Women</a> (which is now a condo complex, of course), located at 140 East 63rd Street, while modeling and attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In the &apos;50s she signed a 7-year contract with MGM under the terms that she be able to keep living here. And outdoing anything you&apos;ve read in the NY Times Wedding section, when she departed the city for The Palace of Monaco on April 4, 1956 for her wedding -- Kelly, her family, her poodle, her wedding party and 80+ pieces of luggage left Pier 84 in New York Harbor on the SS Constitution, causing quite a scene. <br>
