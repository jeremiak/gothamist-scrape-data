<p>This is a photo of an Iroquois Indian&#x2014;So-Tsien-O-Wa-Ne or Big Chief Great Fire&#x2014;patrolling the lake in Central Park in 1925. <em>Why?</em> The Getty caption reads that his job was &quot;to glide around the lake, preserve order, and lend colour.&quot; </p>

<p>A NY Times article (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624061656/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/so-tsien-o-wa-ne/">Ephemeral NY</a>) from April of that year goes into further detail, reporting that he &quot;is to glide hither and thither around the three-mile stretch of water, preserve order, and lend local color.&quot; They add that &quot;he has lived for some years in Brooklyn, although born on a reservation in Montreal. On duty, Chief Great Fire will be attired in the usual buckskin clothes with plenty of feathers attached.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the Parks Department for more information on the stunt, which wouldn&apos;t have been historically accurate, of course, because <em>Manna-hata</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624061656/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenapehoking">was Lenape territory</a>. </p>
