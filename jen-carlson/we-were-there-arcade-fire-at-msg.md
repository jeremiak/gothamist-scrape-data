</div></div><p>So we weren&apos;t overly-enthusiastic about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150442/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/arcade_fire.php">Arcade Fire playing MSG</a> for their New York City run&#x2014;but the realization that this band was actually <em>meant</em> to play the Garden sunk in pretty quickly last night. Instead of dwelling nostalgically on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150442/http://gothamist.com/2004/10/14/cmj_review_night_one_starring_the_arcade_fire.php">that time Win Butler</a> nearly bled real possessed-musician-cutting-thumb-on-guitar blood on us at the significantly smaller Mercury Lounge in 2004, we embraced the goosebumps that were popping up in abundance as the band totally dominated the colossal venue they found themselves in last night, six years later.</p>

<p>Sure, it would have been nice to see them at the circa-1890 Madison Square Garden (the much more aesthetically pleasing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150442/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/flashback_madison_square_garden.php?gallery0Pic=6#gallery">second version of MSG</a>)&#x2014;but the current one isn&apos;t without its charms (for example, who can&apos;t find humor in $9 Bud Lites served in small, flimsy plastic cups?). Where the space failed to be easy on the eyes, the amazing Terry Gilliam stepped in with some magic&#x2014;we&apos;re not technologically in-the-know enough about <em>what</em> he was doing, but it was lovely. You can eventually watch the entire set <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150442/http://www.youtube.com/user/ArcadeFireVEVO">here</a> and see it all for yourself (it also live-streamed last night). Below you&apos;ll find the setlist, see the band play &quot;Empty Room&quot; from their new album <em>The Suburbs</em>, and get a little behind-the-scenes action with Mr. Gilliam:</p>
