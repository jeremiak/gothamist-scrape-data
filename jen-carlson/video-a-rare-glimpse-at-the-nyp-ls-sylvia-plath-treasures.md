<p>Tucked away in a corner of the New York Public Library is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609065347/http://www.nypl.org/about/divisions/berg-collection-english-and-american-literature">the Berg Collection</a>, which holds many treasures, including original writings and items belonging to Dickens, Twain, Woolf, and Kerouac, amongst others. But there&apos;s also a small stash of Sylvia Plath items: her sketches and poetry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609065347/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/16/rare_look_sylvia_plath.php">from when she was a child</a>, a postcard to her grandmother, drafts of &quot;Brasilia,&quot; a letter to literary critic Alfred Kazin, and books that she read and annotated.</p>

<p>In the above video, featuring the NYPL&apos;s Isaac Gewirtz, flip through Plath&apos;s heavily inked-up copy of T.S. Eliot&apos;s <em>Four Quartets</em> and get a rare look at these items, which aren&apos;t on public view and haven&apos;t previously been visually documented.</p>
