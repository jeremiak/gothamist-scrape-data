<p>A press release sent out moments ago by &quot;art collective LaBeouf, R&#xF6;nkk&#xF6; &amp; Turner&quot; has announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529170400/http://gothamist.com/tags/shialabeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> is currently sitting inside of the Angelika Film Center watching his own movies. You can join him.</p><blockquote>From noon today, #ALLMYMOVIES by LaBeouf, R&#xF6;nkk&#xF6; &amp; Turner will commence at the Angelika Film Center, 18 West Houston Street, NYC.<p></p>

<p>Visitors are invited to join Shia LaBeouf in person as he watches all his movies consecutively in reverse chronological order over the next three days, 24 hours a day (admission free).</p></blockquote>You can also watch a livestream of the &quot;performance&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529170400/http://newhive.com/allmymovies">right here</a>, and just in case, we have called the Angelika to confirm this stunt, asking, &quot;Is Shia LaBeouf currently watching his own movies there?&quot; We were told, &quot;Yes, he is.&quot;<p></p>

<p>At press time, Shia seems to be sitting in an empty theater.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Here&apos;s the schedule (and Shia isn&apos;t alone anymore): </p>
