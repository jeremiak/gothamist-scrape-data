title: Six NY-Area Floating Living Spaces YOU Can Live In
---

	
										<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111930/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/greathomesanddestinations/the-houseboat-of-their-dreams.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1368735739-AeesMsBZug1piJxGUboAEQ">the NY Times</a> made me feel bad about not living <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111930/http://sfist.com/2013/05/20/this_mission_creek_houseboat_will_m.php">in a boat off the coast of San Francisco</a>, but I quickly distracted myself from questioning every decision I&apos;ve made in life with a search on Craigslist for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111930/http://gothamist.com/tags/houseboat">a houseboat</a>, or house barge, that I can buy right here in NYC. I can&apos;t afford a boat, or a barge, or even a slip to tie a dinghy to... but I was blessed with a very powerful imagination and the ability to suspend disbelief longer than the average human being. So here are some floating living spaces that are fresh for the taking in the New York area&#x2014;I am <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111930/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vB2_-NtT7w">currently renovating and decorating</a> them with my mind.</p>
