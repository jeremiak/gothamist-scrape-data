<p>It&#x2019;s the first day of Spring, which also means that it&apos;s the tallest resident on Sesame Street&apos;s birthday! Big Bird first appeared when the show premiered in 1969, but he doesn&apos;t look a day over 6 (the age he is frozen in). To celebrate, the Sesame Workshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306145418/http://www.sesameworkshop.org/our-blog/2012/03/20/happy-birthday-big-bird-an-interview-with-sesame-streets-caroll-spinney/">interviewed Caroll Spinney</a> (Big Bird&apos;s human), where he talks about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306145418/http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/sesame-street-farewell-mr-hooper">the saddest day</a> in Big Bird&apos;s life:</p>

<blockquote>The saddest one we did was Big Bird discovering what death means when Mr. Hooper died. They said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t&#x2019; you understand? Mr. Hooper has died.&#x201D; And I said, &#x201C;Yes, well when is he coming back?&#x201D; They said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you understand? Mr. Hooper is never coming back,&#x201D; and quickly everyone is moved to tears. It was probably the most sensitive show we have ever done. When we finished there were tears on all the actors&#x2019; faces. When I came out of the suit, I had to have a towel because I had been crying.</blockquote>

<p>But today is about celebrating life! So let&apos;s take a look at one of the big yellow guy&apos;s old school birthday parties:</p>
