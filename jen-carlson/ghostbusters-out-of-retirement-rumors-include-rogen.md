This isn&apos;t some thrown together, B-list, straight-to-DVD sequel, either. They say &quot;the studio has set <em>The Office</em> co-exec producers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky to write a script for a film designed to bring back together the original cast of Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson.&quot; No word on yet on whether or not they&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012931/http://gothamist.com/2005/11/03/best_film_youre_never_going_to_see_ghostbusters_go_to_hell.php">going to hell</a> in this one, but other rumors surrounding the third installment are running rampant.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012931/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/09/dan_akroyd_implies_that_ghostb.html">NYMag</a> points out that Dan Aykroyd alluded to Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd being two of the new &apos;Busters (in the storyline they&apos;ll be handed over &apos;Busting duties from the old guard), and he hopes to get Judd Apatow involved as well. Watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012931/http://ca.eonline.com/uberblog/b26847_dan_aykroyd_does_tequila_rap.html">the video on E!</a> where he discusses it--and until the new movie gets going, relive the old one. Here&apos;s a map of NYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012931/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/01/map_of_the_day_51.php">Ghostbuster landmarks</a>, some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012931/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/22/ghostbusters_q.php">questions answered</a> about the filming of the original, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012931/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVahVLJzrVQ">the trailer</a>.</p>
