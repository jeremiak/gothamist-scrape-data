His ex-wife, Denise Richards, had been staying in a separate room at the hotel with their two daughters, and accompanied him to a hospital. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013911/http://www.tmz.com/2010/10/26/charlie-sheen-hospitalized-new-york-city-restaurantdenise-richards/">TMZ</a>, Sheen was &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot; and voluntarily went.</p>

<p>Earlier in the night, Sheen was with an unidentified woman, who returned to his room with him&#x2014;it was then, after a night of partying, that he noticed his wallet was missing and went into a rage, which reportedly included taking his anger out on a chandelier in the room. The 45-year-old was arrested last year in Colorado after allegedly threatening to kill his <em>other</em> ex-wife, Brooke Mueller.</p>
