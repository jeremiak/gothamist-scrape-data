The following is an account of what someone purchased four years ago at a stoop sale in Chelsea, for 75 cents: 

</p><blockquote>&quot;In September of 2002 Warren Hill of Montreal Canada was perusing a box of records at a Chelsea, New York street sale when he happened upon a brittle 12&quot; piece of acetone-covered aluminum with the words &quot;Velvet Underground. 4-25-66. Att N. Dolph&quot; written on the label.  He purchased the three records for 75 cents each.
<p>
We cued it up and were stunned  -- the first song was not &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; as on the &quot;Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; Verve LP, but rather it was &quot;European Son&quot;- the song that is last on that LP, and it was a version neither of us had ever heard before! 
</p><p>
The next few days found us scrambling for clues and information about what to make of this find; calling every record collector/historian we knew and reading everything we could find concerning the early recordings of the VU.  We pieced together that this was probably a surviving copy of the legendary Scepter studios recordings which had been regarded as lost (hence the epic moniker &quot;the lost scepter studios recordings&quot; applied to these unheard sessions over the years).  The recording is comprised of the primitive first &quot;finished&quot; version of the LP that Andy Warhol had shopped to Columbia as a ready-to-release debut album by his protege collective &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot;.
</p><p>
This acetate, which is possibly the only surviving copy, represents the first Velvet Underground album as Andy Warhol intended it to be released.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>We will now stop at every stoop sale we pass in this city. And you&apos;ve got one day left before this record is going, going, gone...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114011456/http://cgi.ebay.com/VELVET-UNDERGROUND-NICO-1966-Acetate-LP-ANDY-WARHOL_W0QQitemZ300054910309QQcmdZViewItem">bid away</a>! Yep, it&apos;s on eBay, where you can read the rest of the story. </p>

<p>As of now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114011456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3247408.stm">the most valuable record</a> ever is the copy of Double Fantasy signed by John Lennon for Mark Chapman, who gunned down Lennon hours later. That went for $464,000. The second most expensive record is in the hands of Paul McCartney, who purchased the one-off acetate of The Beatles&apos; first recordings from 1958 for an unknown amount (but it was estimated at just under $200,000) in the 1980s. The bidding for the Velvet album is up to $145,978, just under what Hendrix&apos;s guitar went for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114011456/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/12/05/going_going_gon.php">at the Christie&apos;s auction</a>. </p>
