The center&apos;s director Jonathan Bowles says, &quot;It has to do with different shopping culture. The Dunkin&apos; Donuts is more a middle-class type of place than Starbucks. <strong>Not everybody can afford $4 lattes. It&#x2019;s more of a working person&apos;s Starbucks.</strong>&quot; The chain has 89 outlets in Brooklyn--71 more than Starbucks in the borough. Plus, chains like KFC and Payless thrive in Brooklyn--but will gentrification slowly replace those shops with Cosi&apos;s and J.Crew? The study also provides a borough-by-borough breakdown of what stores are in each borough (did you know NYC only has two Crate &amp; Barrel&apos;s?).</p>
