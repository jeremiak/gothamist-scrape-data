<span class="photo_caption">Old school sex parties at Plato&apos;s Retreat</span></p>

<p>First of all: people are still having orgies out there, even without the cold, loveless mats of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190424/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/28/even_platos_retreat_sex_club_had_ru.php">Plato&apos;s Retreat</a>. Or at least <em>they were</em>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190424/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/chelsea_hotel_bans_orgy_oGwR3B2K6jQWPt49K0UxPM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, orgy organizer Palagia was throwing monthly sex parties at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190424/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">Hotel Chelsea</a> for 11 years... but that&apos;s all coming to an end as hotel manager Arnold Tamasar has now banned them.</p>

<p>Tamasar&apos;s email to the <em>orgy</em>nizer prior to her latest party stated: &quot;We would advise not to book any reservations under your name or alias... We are not honoring your reservation for today or future.&quot; Palagia and her rep blame the changing of the guard at the hotel, which allegedly has a buyer now under an $80 million contract. Prudes! Her rep noted that &quot;managers [at the hotel] used to come to the party. That&apos;s the saddest part because her parties are legendary. The Chelsea is her favorite location.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190424/http://www.onelegupnyc.com/home.htm">Her parties</a> (which create &quot;ever-changing, safe and clean erotic playgrounds&quot;) at the hotel allegedly drew actors, musicians, and television personalities, as well as hotel residents... and we&apos;re guessing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190424/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/28/dylan_thomas_is_baaaaack.php">the ghost of Dylan Thomas</a>. Anyway, time to bring back the key party:</p>
