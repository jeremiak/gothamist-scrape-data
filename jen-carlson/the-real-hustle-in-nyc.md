All in the name of education! Hidden cameras catch their tricks and viewers of their show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312062339/http://www.trutv.com/shows/real_hustle">The Real Hustle</a>, can learn how to avoid and prevent the sketchy situations. </p>

<p>The episodes have included a scary look into the cash machine hustler&apos;s mind, the real deal behind too good to be true apartment listings, and an eavesdropping scam. Perhaps the most terrifying: the Dumpster Dive Caper. Just one rummage through the trash and this team has enough info to mess with a woman&apos;s life. Time to order a paper shredder!</p>

<p>The threesome that&apos;ll teach you a lesson or two about getting scammed is comprised of: Pickpocket and personal security consultant, Apollo Robbins, sleight-of-hand and psychology specialist, Ryan Oakes and professionally-trained actress skilled in distraction techniques, Dani Marco. Even sophisticated city slickers are no match for their skills, so watch some episodes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312062339/http://www.trutv.com/shows/real_hustle/episodes.html">here</a> before someone steals your PIN number.</p>
