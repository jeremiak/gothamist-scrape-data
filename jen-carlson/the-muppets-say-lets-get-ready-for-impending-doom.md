Of course, not even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117121913/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/29/grover_gets_no_respect.php"><em>Super</em> Grover</a> can help clean up George Bush&apos;s war, but he can lend a brightly colored smiling face to fearmongering. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117121913/http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/09/government-figh.html">Wired reports</a> that Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff and his wife Meryl have worked with the Sesame Workshop and the Ad Council to come up with a campaign focusing on <em>preparedness</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117121913/http://www.sesameworkshop.org/initiatives/emotion/ready">They&apos;ve declared</a> that &quot;it&apos;s a fact of life that not every day is a sunny day,&quot; and &quot;recent events have exposed families to a range of disasters; the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have particularly emphasized the need to ensure children&apos;s physical and psychological protection.&quot; Grover and others will be the face of the campaign, which includes DVDs, magazines and more!
