										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="materialgirl0112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326163621im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/materialgirl0112.jpeg" width="350" height="287" class="image-right"> </span>Madonna is expected to hit the road on a tour later this year&#x2014;following her Super Bowl stint&#x2014;in support of her upcoming release, titled <em>MDNA</em> (and yes, she knows that title sound an awful lot like a popular drug). Warming up the press machine, the performer told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326163621/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/01/29/madonna-on-lady-gaga-w-e-her-new-album.html">Newsweek</a> in a recent interview that she&apos;s well worth the hundreds of dollars her fans will shell out to see her. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326163621/http://www.nme.com/news/madonna/61799">Specifically</a>, the 53-year-old star told her fans, <strong>&quot;Start saving your pennies now. People spend $300 on crazy things all the time, things like handbags. So work all year, scrape the money together and come to my show. I&apos;m worth it.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>On her 2009 tour, seats to her MSG show were actually <em>over</em> $300, with ticket prices going up to at least $350. And that&apos;s face value, not scalper pricing. But can you blame her? She has to buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326163621/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2086004/Madonna-goes-ridiculous-lengths-cover-backs-hands.html">so many gloves</a> to cover her scary hands up with. We&apos;ll find out how much she&apos;ll be selling these for shortly after the Super Bowl, when tickets are rumored to be going on sale.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Madonna who once slept on cushions she found in the trash in the East Village (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326163621/http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1079&amp;bih=607&amp;authuser=0&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=7Onh8NmnoZJ0LM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://dariandarlingnyc.blogspot.com/2010/05/at-home-with-madonna.html&amp;docid=BhDOJjy01ksjyM&amp;imgurl=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Pfqyue5KIS8/S-213XOIisI/AAAAAAAADZA/bi6CBzaxixE/s1600/bed_madonna.jpg&amp;w=550&amp;h=362&amp;ei=OgYrT5KtLMrJgQff_PjqDw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=316&amp;sig=104432427216590922700&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=129&amp;tbnw=172&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=18&amp;ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0&amp;tx=90&amp;ty=44">yes, really</a>) is either shaking her head, or quite pleased.</p>
