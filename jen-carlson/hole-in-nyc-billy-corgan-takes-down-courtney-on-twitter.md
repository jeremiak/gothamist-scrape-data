<p>In what he dubs Thoughts #1 through #6, he says, &quot;my songs are MY songs. if you can&apos;t write your own songs maybe you should just be happy that you fooled someone into doing your work for you. maybe you should live off your husband&apos;s money, u know the money he made for writing all those great songs. when you issue someone an apology on YOUR facebook page you might actually mean it and take responsibility for it. But the world is aware of your lack of responsibility, as seen in the gov&apos;t taking away your parental right. Only you could abandon such a beautiful, incredible child who is smarter than u, cooler than u, and better than u. Oops, did I say too much?&quot;</p>

<p>Hole&apos;s new album, <em>Nobody&apos;s Daughter</em>, was co-produced by Corgan, who also helped write some of the songs (as he did for 1998&apos;s <em>Celebrity Skin</em>), dated Love for a period of time, <em>and</em> had his own wing in her Hollywood mansion. These days his taste in women is, well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305230124/http://www.okmagazine.com/2010/03/billy-corgan-admits-to-loving-jessica-simpson/">different</a>.</p>
