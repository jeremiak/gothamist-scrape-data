<p>Would <em>The New Yorker</em>&apos;s 91-year-old mascot, Eustace Tilley, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022150934/http://gothamist.com/tags/manspreading"><em>manspread</em></a>? Dandies are known for their neatness and style, and are rarely associated with bad etiquette. But it&apos;s 2016, and everyone has become a bit of a bar-lowering garbage human, even the 91-year-old Eustace.</p>

<p>The famous character is about to grace <em>The New Yorker</em> cover once again for their anniversary issue (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022150934/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/mystery-man-2">it&apos;s practically tradition</a>), and this time around he&apos;s shown sitting spread eagle on the subway seat(s), eyeing a bee (mosquito? flying bed bug?) with his bifocal glass, coat tail draped between his legs. The tableau is titled, &quot;Eustace Spreads Out,&quot; and it was created by an artist who goes by Liniers. This is the first time manspreading has been featured in the magazine or on the cover, a rep for the magazine told us. (They ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022150934/http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/daily-cartoon-friday-january-9th-subway-manspreading">one cartoon</a>, but it was online only.)</p>

<p>Linears <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022150934/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-2016-02-08">says</a>, &quot;I was concerned that the riff may have run its course... But then I realized that the scourge of &#x2018;manspreading&#x2019; is as impactful as ever.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Can someone photoshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022150934/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/31/helen_mirren_manspreading.php">Dame Helen Mirren</a> in next to him? Thanks.</p>
