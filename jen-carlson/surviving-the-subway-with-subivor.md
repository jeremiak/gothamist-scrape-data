<p>Scaremongering just hit a whole new level underground, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145128/http://subivor.com/">Subivor</a> -- the subway survival kit. The website (after a short video montage of all the ways the subway will ultimately become your tomb) warns straphangers:</p><blockquote>Dear Subway Commuters,<p></p>

<p>Did you know that there are hundreds of subway related fires that occur each year?</p>

<p>Did you know that there are 27,817 structural fires that occur each year, that&apos;s an average of 2,318 per month?</p></blockquote>And there&apos;s always Al Qaeda, who while not mentioned in their text, is all over that aforementioned video. So how do you survive fires, terrorism and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145128/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/16/cloverfield_rev.php">Cloverfield monster attacks</a> while underground? The kit includes:<p></p>

<ul><li>SURVIVAL MASK disposable anti-fog facemask, protects against Toxic Smoke,Concrete Dust, Debris, Radio Active Dirty Bomb - radio - Active particle matter, Biological / Epidemic (e.g Influenza, Small Pox, and Dry spores (e.g. Anthrax Contaminants)
</li><li>3 1/2 inch Flashlight
</li><li>7 inch Orange Pry bar
</li><li>Silver tone Metal Whistle
</li><li>Orange Towelette Pouch
</li><li>Compact Bag</li></ul>

<p>All of that security can be yours for just $27.99, and it comes in a black bag with reflector tape that&apos;s adorned in your favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145128/http://www.dhs.gov/xinfoshare/programs/Copy_of_press_release_0046.shtm">threat level color</a>...or pink. And this lil&apos; lifesaver isn&apos;t just being advertised online, they&apos;ve also got cars (so much safer!) parking in the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn. </p>
