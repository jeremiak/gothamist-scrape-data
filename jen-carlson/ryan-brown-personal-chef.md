                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0609ryanbrown.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929063743im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0609ryanbrown.jpg" width="216" height="350" class="image-left"> </span><em>Chef Ryan Brown and his Brooklyn-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929063743/http://choicecooking.com/">Choice Cooking</a> company provide both catering and personal chef services. For the personal chef service, Brown works with clients to develop custom-designed menus and each meal includes soup/salad, entree and dessert.  We tried some of his offerings, which come pre-cooked in eco-friendly packaging that can be heated up in either the oven or microwave, and found them healthy, hearty and delicious&#x2014;with plenty for leftovers, too. Brown recently told us where the best place to get groceries in New York is, what the personal chef business has been like during these financial times, and a story about catering for a famous client who brought a hooker to dinner.</em></p>

<p><strong>When and why did you start Choice Cooking?</strong> I started Choice Cooking in 1999, after having worked in restaurants (Picholine, Jean Georges being the two most notable).  I had a serious case of restaurant burnout, and realized that while it was an excellent education in cooking, it wasn&apos;t what I wanted to do long term with my life.  I&apos;ve always had an interest in health and nutrition, and starting a personal chef service seemed like a natural way of combining those interests.</p>

<p><strong>Is it a tough time, with the economy, to be a personal chef?</strong> We also do full service catering, and while our catering business has declined quite a lot during the recession, our personal chef services have never done better.  I think this is due to a shift in people&apos;s values--they are more inclined to spend money on something that is healthy, sustaining, allows them more time with their family, as opposed to going out to eat and dropping a lot of money on an extravagant dinner.</p>
