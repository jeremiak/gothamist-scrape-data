title: Lola Staar's Dreamland Returns Next Weekend
---

<p>After lots of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811082901/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/03/video_of_the_day_starr_co.php">partying and posturing</a>, Lola Staar has achieved her goal of re-opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811082901/http://www.dreamlandrollerrink.com/">Dreamland Roller Rink</a> on Coney Island. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811082901/http://kineticcarnival.blogspot.com/2008/07/lolas-dreamland-roller-rink-is-coming.html">Kinetic Carnival</a> reports that an official announcement is expected soon, but expect the rink will be open July 19th through mid October (from 12 noon to midnight every weekend). Only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811082901/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/21/freewheelin_bro.php">fleetingly opened last year</a> after she won a contest, Staar (real name Diana Carlin) has spent her waking hours trying to make her dreamland a reality. Hopefully it will be a permanent, or at least seasonal fixture at the historic Childs Building. </p>
