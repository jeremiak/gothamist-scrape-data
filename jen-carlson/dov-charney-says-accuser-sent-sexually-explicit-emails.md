American Apparel CEO Dov Charney claims, via his lawyers, that 20-year-old Irene Morales was sending him naughty emails long before she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005847/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/dov_charney_charged_with_holding_te.php">filed a lawsuit against him</a> for $260 million. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005847/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/oh_come_on_now_5KP6JgnetEC6yU4iIoYvCP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, Morales&#x2014;who claims she was held as his sex slave&#x2014;&quot;appears more like a money-hungry vixen than a helpless victim&quot; in the emails.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old Charney says she sent him at least 40 nude photos of herself in 2008, a year after she quit the company, with salacious text like, &quot;Daddy&apos;s got a little naughty girl waiting for him.&quot; She allegedly also promised sex acts in exchange for money and clothes, and asked, &quot;If you&apos;re not using one of the many laptops you have, would I be able to use it?&quot; At one point she even begged for a job, &quot;even at the Hoboken store.&quot;</p>

<p>The emails in question were sent under the name Irene Julia, but Charney&apos;s lawyer says they are one in the same. Morales&apos; lawyer told the paper, &quot;We have no way to verify the emails or photos in question or if it is just more of American Apparel&apos;s propaganda. However, it is not unusual for victims of sexual harassment or assault to grow so demoralized that they feel the only value they offer is as a sexual object.&quot;</p>

This morning she appeared on the <em>Today</em> show with her lawyer, who is also Morales&apos; lawyer; he says Morales was forced to send the aforementioned emails.</p>
