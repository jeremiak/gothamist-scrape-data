<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081601/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/28/new_lights_may_be_coming_to_coney_i.php">it was announced</a> that the &quot;Eiffel Tower of Brooklyn,&quot; aka the now defunct Parachute Jump in Coney Island, would be getting a multi-million dollar lighting upgrade. The new lighting scheme, made up of a 8,000 LED lights, will debut on the first day of summer (June 21st), with Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz on hand to help flip the switch. Markowitz declares: &#x201C;It brings the bling back to Coney Island.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081601/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/coney-island-parachute-jump-2-million-upgrade-article-1.1313170#ixzz2QA9pLzsU">the Daily News</a>, &quot;Markowitz and other pols spent $1.5 million to have the light artist Leni Schwendinger&quot; give the Jump a makeover. Previously, it had just 450 lights, but with the new programmable display it will be so bright it will be seen from space (paging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081601/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrishadfield">Chris Hadfield</a>). </p>

<p>The 262-foot-tall Parachute Jump is the tallest structure in Coney Island, and was built for the 1939 World&apos;s Fair (moving to Coney in 1941). It will now be lit up whenever Luna Park is operating, and when there are special events in the area. It&apos;s just too bad that some of that $2 million didn&apos;t go towards making it functional again: </p>
