In September they sweet talked their way into six &#x2014; and once making their way inside, they robbed their victims clean of thousands in cash and jewelry. Two suspects have been identified as John George and Steven Demetro, though no arrests have been made. Authorities say, &quot;These two individuals are part of a team of gypsies that target elderly homeowners with the ruse that there is a leak in the home.&quot;</p>
