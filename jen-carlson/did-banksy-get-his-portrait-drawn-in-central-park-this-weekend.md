                            <p>Over the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> slyly set up a stand amongst the vendors bordering Central Park, charging an older gent with the task of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/13/video_banksy_set_up_a_pop_up_booth.php">selling his work for just $60 a pop</a>. Only three people purchased items throughout the day, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://chicagoist.com/2013/10/14/if_you_know_this_chicago_man.php">seemingly unaware</a> that they just scooped up works of art worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Let&apos;s just not think about what we all missed out on, and continue in to Day 14 of Banksy&apos;s New York City invasion, which features <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/photo_latest_banksy_seems_to_be_in_1.php#photo-1">a piece in Queens</a>, and a few other crumbs below...</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> A tipster alerted us to the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64029621317/i-walked-by-this-yesterday-in-central-park">Humans of New York</a> post, which features a photo of a man in a blue closed-face unitard being drawn by a portrait artist in Central Park over the weekend. Was it Banksy recreating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://www.banksy-prints.com/2010/06/banksy-caught-on-camera-for-real-this-time/">that other time</a> he had his portrait done in NYC? We will probably never know, you guys, but that will never stop us from making wild speculations.</p>

<p>When pressed for more details about the scene, Brandon, who took the photo, told us, &quot;Unfortunately don&apos;t have any extra info to add.&quot; Sounds exactly like what someone working for Banksy would say.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Is tomorrow&apos;s piece going to be on the Upper East Side? Earlier today someone saw &quot;a hooded man with a big backpack&quot; and two of his friends jump out the back of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/stuffed_animal_truck_is_the_work_of.php">the stuffed animal truck</a> and walk up 79th Street&#x2014;the witness wonders if the hooded man was Banksy scoping out his next wall.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> While in Williamsburg last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/photos_video_banksys_enchanting_mob.php">the waterfall truck</a> got a parking ticket. Womp womp, etc.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> And finally, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128053723/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/dailycartoon/2013/10/daily-cartoon-monday-october-14th.html?utm_source=tny&amp;utm_campaign=generalsocial&amp;utm_medium=facebook"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> can&apos;t ignore Banksy.</p>
