<p>In 2007, Stanley Bard, the longtime proprietor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007085833/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">the Hotel Chelsea</a>, gave me a tour of the place just as he was being ousted by the board of directors. The iconic hotel is filled with legends and lore, which is 100% thanks to the Bard family allowing for creatives to do their thing there for decades. That all changed after Stanley Bard&apos;s departure, though a few longtime residents are still hanging on inside as the place passes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007085833/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/11/1/13481084/hotel-chelsea-bd-hotels-sold">through hands of hoteliers</a>. One of those residents, Ed Hamilton, alerted me this morning that Stanley Bard has died at the age of 82. </p>

<p>&quot;Stanley is survived by thousands of people in the arts who have called the Chelsea Hotel their home&#x2014;for a night, a week, a month, a year, or for several decades&#x2014;and who will continue to honor his memory in their lives and their art for many years to come,&quot; Hamilton wrote, adding that &quot;as long as the Chelsea Hotel stands, the spirit of Stanley and his undying dedication to the arts he so loved will live on.&quot; </p>

<p>Hamilton, author of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007085833/https://www.amazon.com/Chintz-Age-Tales-Love-Loss/dp/0986111198">The Chintz Age</a></em>, has also written a tribute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007085833/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2017/02/-stanley-bard-former-owner-and-manager-of-the-chelsea-hotel-dies-at-82.html">on his blog</a>, declaring Stanley to be &quot;the guiding spirit of the greatest experiment in bohemian living in the history of New York, if not the world.&quot; He adds that he was in Boca Raton, Florida, at the time of his death, surrounded by his loved ones; &quot;he had been ill for the last few years, succumbed to a massive stroke.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a video from the tour Bard gave me a decade ago, when he was heartbroken to be losing the keys. Here&apos;s what he told me:</p><blockquote>&quot;I created something over a lifetime that I thought was beautiful and worth preserving, and so respected... by everyone. I felt it would be a shame to have that disturbed in any way. I never wanted the Chelsea to be a conformist community. It&apos;s uncomfortable to me, to say the least. I have to protect the integrity, the people... and I feel these are my friends, and they&apos;re worth protecting, and that&apos;s the beautiful part of it. Why would anyone want to change that? My tenants like me and respect me, and I respect them, totally and wholeheartedly. It&apos;s a Mutual Admiration Society. It took me one lifetime to create that, I hope I live another lifetime to see that it&apos;s preserved.&quot;</blockquote><p></p>
