<p>What do you think Julia Stiles was listening to while taking the R train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043103/http://goingwitheddie.com/2013/04/12/they-deal-with-bull-shit-photo-by-kateryna-k/">yesterday</a>... <em>The Bell Jar</em>? Do you think she was looking for her copy of <em>The Bell Jar</em> in her purse so she could read along with the audio book? What music do you think pairs best with <em>The Bell Jar</em>? I always liked Belle &amp; Sebastian, but maybe I was just going through a Belle &amp; Sebastian phase last time I read it. (Belle &amp; Sebastian also pairs well with Salinger&apos;s <em>Franny &amp; Zooey</em>.) Did she want to get out her moleskine to jot down notes for a future film adaptation of <em>The Bell Jar</em> that even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043103/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/julia_stiles_talks_about_paying_for.php">she told us</a> probably wasn&apos;t going to happen we&apos;d still like to see happen because eventually <em>someone</em> is going to do it and it might as well be her? Do you think Sylvia Plath ever took the R train? Do you think Sylvia Plath totally nailed it when she called the subway entrances &quot;fusty, peanut-smelling mouths&quot;? Was it really scarf weather yesterday? Do you think we can get through this without someone saying &quot;celebrities: they&apos;re just like us&quot;?</p>
