</div></div>					<p>Everyone is talking about the unfortunate and cringe-inducing Q-Tip incident in last night&apos;s episode of <em>Girls</em>, but what about that other drug store item: condoms? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221205223/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/lena_dunham_interview_1.php">first season</a> of the show highlighted Hannah Horvath&apos;s obsession with safe sex, &quot;stuff that gets up around the sides of condoms,&quot; and AIDS-fears, but this season has the characters living in a World Without Condoms, and presumably consequences.</p>

<p>Yes, the show is touted for being a true-to-life snapshot of twenty-somethings in New York City, and not every young man or lady out there has safety on the mind after drinking the night away at the Turkey&apos;s Nest or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221205223/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/28/barely_breathing.php">stepping out of a torture-art contraption</a>... but shouldn&apos;t someone think of the naive Midwestern youths who emulate this world and its characters? Remember: there were people who were legitimately angry when they discovered that Carrie Bradshaw&apos;s New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221205223/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/young_writer_who_moved_to_nyc_finds.php"><em>didn&apos;t exist</em></a>.</p>

<p>We ran some data through a statistics machine and discovered that at least one of these characters would have gotten knocked up or contracted a disease by now, so in the real world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221205223/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> is probably responsible for at least a few burning urinary tracts. Click through for a brief, somewhat spoiler-y, and NSFW history of unsafe sex in this season of <em>Girls</em>&#x2014;these are the scenes where either it was very clear no condom was used, or not using a condom was discussed.</p>
