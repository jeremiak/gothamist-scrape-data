<p>New York is a city of small spaces. If you are not prepared to live in a tiny apartment, squeeze into a crowded train car, and brush up against a sweaty stranger on the sidewalk, then you are in the wrong town. But as New Yorkers, we also reserve the right to rant passionately about things that annoy us, and this is where we&apos;re drawing the line at small spaces. </p>

<p>The restaurant tables <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015234424/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/608295323853848576">are too damn close together</a>.</p>

<p>Let us paint you a familiar picture: you enter a restaurant, it&apos;s blissfully empty except for that one couple... who the server seats you directly next to. The table is shifted over and out, widening the 1&quot; space briefly so that you may comfortably climb into your dining prison. </p>

<p>Meet your fellow inmates. Are they on a first date? Are they breaking up? Is he going to propose? Did he try to do that weird thing in bed again? <em>&quot;Why do you keep trying that, Brian?&quot;</em> You will soon find out, because their conversations are now your conversations. </p>

<p>Or perhaps a solo diner was seated next to you and your friend, and is not even pretending to read or play a game on his/her phone. Maybe this solo diner will even start contributing to your private conversation, breaking down the conceptual privacy wall you so needed to believe existed in order to make this night out enjoyable and therefore worth your hard-earned money. </p>

<p>Restaurant owners are dealing with the same space constraints as the rest of us, of course, and they need to utilize all of their square footage in the $martest way possible&#x2014;but <em>they do not</em> need to seat you directly next to the only other people in the establishment. The above photo was taken at Javelina, and shows three separate parties crammed into one corner, as empty tables surround them like a mirage just out of reach. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015234424/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/dining/the-grocery-to-close-in-carroll-gardens-brooklyn.html?_r=1">dearly departed Grocery</a> in Brooklyn, which was pin-drop quiet, was also known to pull this move, making for the awkwardest of dining experiences when the place wasn&apos;t at capacity.</p>

<p>And yes, people are listening, judging, tweeting... COUNSELING IS A HEALTHY AND VALID DECISION DIANE.</p>

<p>As far as privacy is concerned, the basic layout of tables isn&apos;t helping, either. Over on East 9th Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015234424/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/30/the_worlds_most_famous_veggie_burge.php">Superiority Burger</a> has created this awkward solo seating situation, which resembles the front car of a roller coaster. Wheeeeeee! Remember when there was dignity in dining?</p>

<p>Oh never mind, things have always been this awkward. Back in 2007, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015234424/https://www.flickr.com/photos/myszka/2012026488">one Flickr user</a> captured this table at Mill Korean in Morningside Heights. Mill Korean, by the way, is a restaurant for adults, not children who just got a &quot;time out.&quot; And for adults, this is the perfect eavesdropping table, as staring at a brick wall really clears your mind of any clutter and lets you focus more intently on the gossip unfolding just an elbows-length away.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="08tablenyc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015234424im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/08tablenyc.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span><br>

<p>While we can&apos;t do anything about the small spaces, if space does allow, we can ask to be seated at a table that&apos;s not pushed up against a stranger&apos;s body. Oh, that table is reserved. Of course it is.  </p>

<p>Failing that, just chat loudly about death and nauseating smells if you think someone is eavesdropping:</p>
