</div></div>					<p>Earlier this year we chatted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/24/rachel_maddow_talk_show_host.php">with Rachel Maddow</a> (MSNBC host, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/01/video_rachel_maddow_discusses_bout.php">swine flu survivor</a> and cocktail aficionado) about many things, including the search for the perfect pre-prohibition Scotch drink. At the time, she told us, &quot;Scotch is used in very few cocktails, but when it is used, it can be very effective. So I&apos;m very interested in trying to figure out what&apos;s beyond the Blood and Sand in terms of Scotch in cocktails.&quot;</p>

<p>So, we called upon some of the city&apos;s best mixologists to take this Scotch challenge to task, and this past Tuesday night we all gathered at the Gonzo Room inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://www.aspen-nyc.com/">Aspen Restaurant</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/">Ms. Maddow</a> was done filming her show for the day, and, well, drank a lot of Scotch (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://www.thedalmore.com/">thanks to Dalmore</a> for their generous contribution and for the brutal Wednesday morning hangovers!). Justin Kirk from <em>Weeds</em> also dropped by, awkwardly showing up wearing the same sport coat as Gothamist staffer John Del Signore, nearly inciting a vicious catfight.</p>

<p>The mixologists on hand were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://ourdailytable.blogspot.com/2009/09/thursday-morning-interrupted.html">Jennifer Nelson</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://www.buttermilkchannelnyc.com/">Buttermilk Channel</a>, Richard Boccato of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://www.dutchkillsbar.com/">Dutch Kills</a>, Payman Bahmani of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://lifesacocktail.com/">Life&apos;s a Cocktail</a>, Yael Vengroff of Woodson &amp; Ford and Jason Litrell of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213156/http://www.randolphnyc.com/">the Randolph</a>. Alas, no winner was declared (because they were <em>all</em> delicious), but we stole some of their recipes from the night, which you can find after the jump.</p>
