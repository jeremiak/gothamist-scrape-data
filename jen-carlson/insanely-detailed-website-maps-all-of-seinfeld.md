<span class="photo_caption"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073916/http://mapsaboutnothing.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/jerrys-apartment/">Jerry&apos;s apartment</a> was at 129 W. 81st Street, Apt 5A</span></p>

<p>Yesterday the creator of this website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073916/http://mapsaboutnothing.wordpress.com/">Maps About Nothing</a>, alerted us to his project. Initially, thinking we&apos;d seen every possible way to keep the show alive, we yawned and clicked the link, thinking: &quot;What is the deal with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073916/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> obsession?&quot; But this site is actually pretty amazing. Everyone else can stop working on their <em>Seinfeld</em> hobby projects now.</p>

<p>The creator&#x2014;Dan Zinman from Canada&#x2014;tells us his site includes &quot;every single location in the history of Seinfeld, in NYC and beyond, all in one place.&quot; And it really, really does. He explained: &quot;I compiled the list over about 6 months while in university 5 years ago... let it sit for a while, then it took about 3 months to put the site together and organize everything afterwards. Process was simple really&#x2014;ridiculous attention to detail, and a lot of Google Maps hunting.&quot; You can search by location (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073916/http://mapsaboutnothing.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/kramers-apartment/">Kramer&apos;s apartment</a>), by countries and states (even when they&apos;re <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073916/http://mapsaboutnothing.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/north-dakota/">just mentioned</a></em>), and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073916/http://mapsaboutnothing.wordpress.com/episodes/">by episodes</a>.</p>

<p>Just try to ignore that he Yada Yada&apos;d Harlem, Inwood and Washington Heights <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073916/http://mapsaboutnothing.wordpress.com/locations/">in the map</a>.</p>
