</div></div>					<p>The folks behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160118165500/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/10/rock_n_bowl_in_williamsburg.php">Brooklyn Bowl</a> have been sinking lots of money and time into their ambitious bowling alley/rock venue/restaurant hybrid, and the grand unveiling is coming soon...hopefully. The massive space boasts a 600 person capacity for concerts, 16 lanes, a stellar sound system (remember this place is brought to you by the Wetlands guys), a menu including french bread pizzas and burgers from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160118165500/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/23/brooklyn_bowl_teams_up_with_blue_ri.php">Blue Ribbon</a>, dining tables made out of old bowling lanes and aesthetic touches by one of the designers of Dressler. </p>

<p>The location used to be an old ironworks foundry dating back to the 1880s, and the owners are applying for LEED certification, which would make it the first bowling alley in the country to have that (in keeping green, the stage lighting is almost entirely LED). And yes, there will sometimes be live music playing while you bowl (musicians even get their own green room). Expect an opening date in June (they&apos;re still waiting on the Certificate of Occupancy, liquor and cabaret licenses; stay tuned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160118165500/http://www.brooklynbowl.com/">their website</a>), but for now feast your eyes on some photos we shot last night.</p>
