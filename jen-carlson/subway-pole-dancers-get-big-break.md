Way to go, America. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708000401/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/10/four_women_pole.php">Remember those girls</a> who took their underground antics to YouTube, showcasing their stripper-esque talents to straphangers and anyone with an internet connection? They&apos;re finally getting their big screen debut.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708000401/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/22/2010-04-22_subway_dancers_to_strut_talent.html">the Daily News</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708000401/http://www.myspace.com/pole_itegirls">Pole-Ite Girls</a>, as they&apos;re known, have been invited to compete for $1 million on the NBC reality show. Isis Masoud told the paper, &quot;We are ready to take what we learned in the subway and show the nation something they&apos;ve never seen before.&quot; Her cohort Paula Sanders added, &quot;We are representing New York and we take pride in being edgy and pushing the envelope.&quot;</p>

<p>Their 90-second shot at fame will be filmed right at Manhattan&apos;s Hammerstein Ballroom tomorrow night (it&apos;s unclear if they&apos;ll recreate a subway car for the stage). If they dazzle the judges (who include Sharon Osbourne and Howie Mandel), they&apos;ll head to Vegas for the next level, and then on to LA for their shot at the jackpot. And a video, after the jump:</p>
