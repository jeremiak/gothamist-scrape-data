<p>Do you want to smell like the Apple Store? An artistic collaborative has created what they believe is the scent one whiffs when opening up an Apple box and pulling out a brand new MacBook Pro (soon available for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022848/http://www.greatesthitswebsite.com/">purchase online</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022848/http://www.air-aroma.com/blog/the-scent-of-a-apple-product-sourcing-the-macbook-pro-fragrance">They say</a> &quot;a distinctive scent can be observed when unwrapping a newly purchased Apple product from its packaging,&quot; one that Apple fans will recognize. But what about the olfactory of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022848/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/26/foxconn_fabulist_mike_daisey_apolog.php">factory workers</a> in China? Or the scent of the grown men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022848/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/apple_fans_line_up_to_get_their_han.php">waiting on line</a> for days for a new product to be released? There are so many possibilities&#x2014;so we await version 2.0 of this fragrance.</p>

<p>In the meantime, maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023022848/http://www.bondno9.com/">Bond No. 9</a> can create scents that capture all of the Apple Stores in the five boroughs... because Grand Central, 5th Avenue and Staten Island <em>have</em> to <em>Stink Different</em>, right?
