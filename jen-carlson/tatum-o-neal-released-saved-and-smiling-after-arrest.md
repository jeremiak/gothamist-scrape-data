The actress was busted buying crack and cocaine on Clinton Street, not far from her apartment in The Forward building, around 7:30 p.m. Not even a full 24-hours later she quickly came clean <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155510/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032008/news/columnists/tatum_to_cops__thanks__113776.htm">to The NY Post</a>, thanked the cops for saving her, and is even trying to help the guy who sold her the drugs, Alan Garcia.</p>

<p>She told the paper that her recent struggle towards recovery was nearly ruined by Sunday&apos;s walk, but &quot;the cops came and saved me!&quot; As for what set her off, she explained:</p><blockquote>&quot;I lost my Scottish terrier, Lena,&quot; three weeks ago. &quot;That seemed to set me off. She got old. She got cancer. She was the fabric of our family. We had to let her go to heaven. My daughter and I had to put her down. It was too horrible for words. I couldn&apos;t get out of it. I was going to my psychiatrist. I was doing everything I could do. I have the disease of alcoholism. It&apos;s lifelong. I treat it every day by going to my 12-step program.&quot;</blockquote>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155510/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06022008/news/regionalnews/tatum_in_coke_arrest_113529.htm">The Post detailed</a> how the drug deal went down, and reportedly she was found with &quot;two yellow plastic bags of cocaine in her front pants pockets.&quot; While there was no further mention of crack, the paper did explain to her that she was also busted for that drug (&quot;It&apos;s both?&quot; she asked, surprised. &quot;I didn&apos;t even know what I was buying!&quot;). As for her night behind bars, O&apos;Neal describes how she made the best of it:<blockquote>&quot;I slept on a mattress with a couple of ladies because I was tired,&quot; she giggled. &quot;And they were nice! And I thought the thing that was cool about New York, no special treatment. No special cell.&quot;</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155510/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/06/03/2008-06-03_child_sensation_tatum_oneal_hits_rock_bo.html">The Daily News</a> retraces O&apos;Neal&apos;s steps to rock bottom, and while everyone seems to be rooting for the actress -- her publisher is using her brush with the dark side as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155510/http://gawker.com/tag/celebrity_industrial-complex/?i=5012483&amp;t=coke-bust-to-bump-sales-for-tatum-oneal-publisher">a selling point for O&apos;Neal&apos;s 2005 memoir</a>.<p></p>
