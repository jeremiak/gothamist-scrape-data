</div></div>					<p>This week, a new restaurant opened in Brooklyn&apos;s Clinton Hill: The Wallace&#x2014;an undertaking by soon to be husband and wife team of Chef Jon Wallace &#x2029;(previously &#x2029;of&#x2029; Thistle&#x2029; Hill&#x2029; Tavern &#x2029;and &#x2029;Buttermilk&#x2029; Channel) and Jessica Soule. The duo are &quot;paying tribute to the diverse American culture and cuisine found in the multi-faceted borough of Brooklyn while saluting all things local and home-made.&quot; In fact, they say a &quot;majority of the quality driven ingredients used at The Wallace (from the cheese to the sausage to the jams to the buns) are made <em>in-house</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Some offerings from their menu include: Seasonal &quot;Housemade Flatbreads&quot; (with housemade ricotta, grilled, marinated radicchio, crushed red pepper, runny egg); Oysters Oregenata: Oregano infused aioli, Bread crumbs; Housemade Buratta Salad (Savory peach puree, endive, parsley, peach vinaigrette, crispy herbs); Duck Breast (Fingerling potatoes, baby turnips, shaved brussel sprouts, duck demi glaze); The Wallace Burger (House ground short rib &amp; tongue burger, house made whole wheat roll, picked jalape&#xF1;o, blue cheese, with cheese smothered broccoli); Butternut Squash Risotto (Mascarpone, pecorino romano, balsamic reduction); and Braised Oxtails (Creamy polenta, toasted breadcrumbs, crispy garlic). Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013305/http://www.soulebrooklyn.com/menu.html">menus here</a> (they&apos;ve even got brunch).</p>

<p>Price points: Entrees hover around the $20 range, while beers start at $6, and wines start at $9 (a Bloody Mary at brunch is a pretty reasonable $8).</p>
