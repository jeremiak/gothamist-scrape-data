										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpLzKZM7PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151656im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpLzKZM7PM.jpg" width="120" height="86" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151656/http://gothamist.com/tags/coyote">Coyotes</a> have made their way to Columbia University&apos;s Morningside campus. Over the past week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151656/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/05/central_park_coyote_spotted_again.php">one has been spotted</a> roaming around Central Park... but now they are multiplying and possibly prepping for a takeover after getting an Ivy League education! Columbia Public Safety reported the sightings of the three coyotes, observed in front of Lewisohn Hall this morning&#x2014;at which point 911 was called and the NYPD responded. They&apos;re all still at large, but the one they did manage to spot &quot;went behind the CEPSR build and it is believed he exited the campus.&quot; Ergo, <em>no one is safe</em>. If you are in the area, you are advised not to approach the wascally guys and report them immediately, narcs.</p>
