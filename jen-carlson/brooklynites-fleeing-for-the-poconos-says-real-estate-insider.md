<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="poconotub.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234852im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/poconotub.jpeg" width="350" height="245" class="image-right"> </span>In the latest trend sweeping the borough, a real estate &quot;insider&quot; declares that Brooklyn residents are making a mass exodus to a magical land called The Poconos&#x2014;that place where your parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234852/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenc/4228353808/">went on their Honeymoon</a>. The Pennsylvania &quot;hot spot&quot; is just 90 minutes from New York City, and Christine D&#x2019;Amico of Toll Brothers developers says, &#x201C;at some point it turned into a primary location as opposed to just a weekend resort type of area.&quot; Over the past couple of years, half of their Poconos sales have been to buyers from Brooklyn.</p>

<p>D&apos;Amico told the Brooklyn Paper&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234852/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/36/7/all_escapetothepoconos_2013_02_15_bk_.html">who are helping to hype</a> this whole thing up&#x2014;that many can afford a brand new four-bedroom home at what they&apos;re paying in rent in Brooklyn. And if you need to commute to the city, there&apos;s a bus service that will shuttle you to Port Authority every morning <em>for the rest of your life</em>. Doesn&apos;t it just sound like a DREAM? And in August, they&apos;ll have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234852/http://phantasytour.com/bands/1/topics/3362474/posts?page=1">Phish festival</a>!</p>

<p>According to a quick scan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234852/http://poconos.craigslist.org/search/apa?zoomToPosting=&amp;altView=&amp;query=&amp;srchType=A&amp;minAsk=&amp;maxAsk=&amp;bedrooms=&amp;hasPic=1">of Craigslist</a>&#x2014;where listings declare: &quot;Move Here... We have IT all... No need to leave home!&quot;&#x2014;you can rent a 3 bedroom home for around $1400 (even the ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234852/http://poconos.craigslist.org/apa/3600199828.html">with new carpeting</a>!), and homes start at around $120,000 to purchase.</p>

<p>Real estate agent Kriss Ferrara moved from the city to the Poconos (where we&apos;re guessing she holds a few listings) and told the paper, &quot;It&#x2019;s almost like a bedroom community for New York City... After several years of living in New York people can&#x2019;t take it any more and have to get out.&#x201D; But not everyone seems 100% about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234852/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4AOBdI1bsc">the land of champagne glass hottubs</a>, sources say one solitary tear came to the eye of a former Brooklyn resident while she told the paper: &#x201C;I guess sometimes I wish I could just walk to the store, or something like that.&quot;</p>
