<p>Kate Upton, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035826/http://gothamist.com/tags/kateupton">who you know</a> from the most recent <em>Sports Illustrated</em> Swimsuit Issue cover, filmed a tv commercial last November in Tompkins Square Park for Zoo York. But now no one will air it, partially for the cursing cockroaches, and partially for the model&apos;s assets. The ad was rejected by both MTV and the Adult Swim Network on account of the profanity (which would be bleeped out anyway) and Upton&#x2019;s &#x201C;erect nipple,&#x201D; according to the company. The commercial&apos;s pretty crass, but a true Nipplegate this is not:</p>
