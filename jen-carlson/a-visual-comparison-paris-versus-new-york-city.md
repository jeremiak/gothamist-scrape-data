</div></div>					<p>This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102132/http://parisvsnyc.blogspot.com/">Vahram Muratyan</a>&apos;s book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102132/http://www.amazon.com/Paris-versus-New-York-Cities/dp/0143120255/?tag=gothamist03-20"><em>Paris Versus New York</em></a> was released, which we only heard about after seeing some Tweets about an event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102132/https://twitter.com/#!/PenguinPbks/status/165444686507552768/photo/1">at the Standard</a> last night that no one told us about. La baise Fran&#xE7;ais! Anyway, the book is very visually compelling, comparing the two cities with some gorgeous graphic design work, with a subtitle: A Tally of Two Cities. Muratyan is French-born, but <em>has</em> lived in New York before, and recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102132/http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/13/travel/paris-versus-new-york/index.html">told CNN</a> what he misses about either city when he&apos;s not there:</p>

<blockquote>In New York, I used to miss my bike. But now I can even have a bike there, so it&apos;s becoming more European than ever. I used to miss baguette bread and now it&apos;s OK. I can find something much closer to Paris baguettes. And there&apos;s a big variety of bread there, so I don&apos;t care. In Paris, I miss the way people can talk to each other just for even five minutes in the street like in New York. People are more easygoing. It&apos;s something that is missing in Paris, in a way.</blockquote>

<p> Click through for a look, as you ponder: bagels or baguettes?</p>
