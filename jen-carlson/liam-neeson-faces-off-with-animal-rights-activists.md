Last week a story ran in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063545/http://www.irishecho.com/newspaper/story.cfm?id=18971">Irish Echo</a> regarding the New Yorker resident&apos;s public support of the Central Park carriage industry, which came out in a letter to the City Council. </p>

<p>Neeson stated in the open letter that there&apos;s been a &quot;coordinated attempt by animal activists and a certain Queens council member to ban the industry from the city.&quot; Indeed, Tony Avella&apos;s bill to put an end to carriage horses is being introduced at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063545/http://carriagehorsesnyc.blogspot.com/2009/01/public-hearing-for-carriage-horse-bill.html">a public hearing</a> on January 30th (at the same time the industry will also propose their first fare increase in 19 years). Neeson (who didn&apos;t seem at all like an animal cruelty supporter in that <em>Love, Actually</em> movie) continued his letter as follows:</p><blockquote>As a horse lover and rider, I am deeply disturbed by the unnecessary and misguided political and extreme rhetoric against the horse-drawn carriage industry and feel obliged to counter this action.<p></p>

<p>The horse-drawn carriage business is an iconic part of this city, employing hundreds of dedicated, hard-working men and women, caring for well-bred, well-trained horses and attracting tourists to New York City for over 100 years.</p>

<p>As a proud New York resident, I have personally enjoyed the beauty of Central Park on a daily basis for many years, and these horses are an undeniable integral part of that experience. The notion that a well-nourished horse pulling a carriage through Central Park is considered cruelty may fit in with animal activists&apos; extremist view, but not with the rest of us. Surely we have a responsibility to protect commerce, especially one with such history, and one I truly feel helps define this city. May pragmatism prevail.</p></blockquote>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063545/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01192009/gossip/pagesix/liam_bridles_at_horse_bill_150848.htm">the NY Post</a> is pitting him against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063545/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/06/19/alec_baldwin_to_help_end_horse_cruelty_">Alec Baldwin</a>, who recently came out in support of putting an end to the industry.<p></p>
