<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194323/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/16/subway_seats_1.php">Last week</a> we spotted the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194323/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/02/are_seatless_subways_in_our_future.php">seatless subway</a>&quot;&#x2014;furnished with seats that easily flip-up during busy rush hour commutes to create room for more straphangers. You know, so we can work our way towards being more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194323/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0A9-oUoMug">like Japan</a>. At the time, Deputy Director of Public Affairs, Deirdre Parker, told us that they were brought in for a test, but the &quot;seats are locked in the down position and will remain that way. There is no plan at this point to run those cars in the up position.&quot; So there we have it, human <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194323/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/flashback_cow_tunnels.php">cattle cars</a> are not in our future.</p>

<p>In case you had any doubt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194323/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/26/2010-08-26_you_can_rest_easy_seatless_subway_plan_nixed_by_mta.html">the Daily News</a> now confirms that the seats will remain in a down position; a transit official told them, &quot;People are already feeling they&apos;re paying more for less. I don&apos;t know that a train like that, even though the idea was to increase capacity, was something that the public would have embraced. We&apos;re not going down that road.&quot;</p>

<p>A rep on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board says if the plan did roll out to all the trains, &quot;<strong>there would have been civil disobedience. I think people would have brought bolt cutters and unlocked the seats.</strong>&quot; However, similar subway cars have been introduced in Boston and allegedly there have been no complaints <em>or</em> reports of civil disobedience... and they&apos;re way more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194323/http://gothamist.com/tags/boston">uncivilized</a> than us!</p>
