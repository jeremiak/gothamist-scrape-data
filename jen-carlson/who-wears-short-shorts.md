<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpAOS67jPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035322im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpAOS67jPM.jpg" width="151" height="145" class="image-right"> </span>In an unfortunate pairing with the alleged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035322/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/fashion/13POTBELLY.html?_r=1&amp;ref=fashion">potbelly trend</a> happening in Williamsburg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035322/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09032009/entertainment/fashion/shorts_story_187803.htm">the NY Post&apos;s Justin Rocket</a> says that showing a little man-thigh with some short shorts is now all the rage. This is all based off of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035322/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/31/the_grizz.php">final Pool Party</a> crowd this weekend, where men were showing more skin than the ladies. One 27-year-old told them, &quot;I can feel the breeze now. I do feel a little girly, but this is great!&quot; Meanwhile, 31-year-old Nicolas Carr,  who teamed up his short shorts with suspenders, said, &quot;My wife was giving me a hard time when I left the house this morning. Said I looked like grandpa. <strong>If you are revealing testicles, then it&apos;s too short. But otherwise, why shouldn&apos;t guys be able to wear shorts as short as girls?</strong>&quot; Women applauded, saying they aren&apos;t the only ones with nice legs. Perhaps, but they are the only ones with shaved legs. Are you there, winter? It&apos;s us, Williamsburg ... please arrive soon.</p>
