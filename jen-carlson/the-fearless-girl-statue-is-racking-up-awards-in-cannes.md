					<p>If there was any doubt left that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620013406/http://gothamist.com/tags/fearlessgirl">Fearless Girl</a> was simply a prop for a global investment firm... well, just watch the commercial below, which is currently racking up awards at the Cannes Lions 64th International Festival of Creativity. Time to pop the champagne, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620013406/https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/03/08/too-bad-that-statue-of-a-girl-staring-down-the-wall-street-bull-is-a-pr-stunt-by-wall-street-patriarchs/">Wall Street patriarchs</a>!</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620013406/http://www.adweek.com/creativity/fearless-girl-takes-cannes-by-storm-winning-3-grand-prix-on-her-first-day">to AdWeek</a>, McCann&apos;s Fearless Girl statue&#x2014;which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620013406/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/07/fearless_girls_interview.php">created by sculptor Kristen Visbal</a>, and placed on Wall Street by State Street Global Advisors (who now own her cast)&#x2014;is &quot;sweeping up&quot; at the festival. The outlet notes how judges were impressed that &quot;it had such immediate global impact through such an incredibly simple and inspired execution.&quot; </p>

<p>Judge Wendy Clark noted how it &quot;elegantly captures women&#x2019;s journeys and our path to empowerment,&quot; before digging into how it has benefited the male-run company:</p>

<blockquote>Clark also cited the business results for State Street, including a 374 percent increase in the size of the so-called SHE fund&#x2014;State Street&#x2019;s SSGA Gender Diversity Index, which tracks the performance of U.S. companies that are leaders in advancing women through gender diversity on their boards and in senior leadership positions.</blockquote>

<p>It&apos;s worth noting that State Street continues to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620013406/https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/05/05/guess-who-state-street-global-advisors-the-company-behind-the-fearless-girl-just-hired-into-leadership-positions/">a gender diversity problem of its own</a>.</p>
