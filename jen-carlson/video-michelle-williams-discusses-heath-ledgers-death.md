										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ledgerwilliams1210.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ledgerwilliams1210.jpg" width="125" height="178" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s coming up on the third anniversary of Heath Ledger&apos;s death, who was found dead in his downtown NYC apartment on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072544/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/22/heath_ledger_fo.php">January 22nd, 2008</a>. He left his ex Michelle Williams behind, along with their daughter Matilda (who is now 5 years old), and during that time there were <em>a lot</em> of photos surfacing of Williams walking around her neighborhood of Park Slope, but she rarely discussed his death. </p>

<p>Now she has opened up for one of the first times during a <em>Nightline</em> interview (watch below), saying that she &quot;understood&quot; why people were curious about her following Ledger&apos;s death. </p>

<p>Williams also says, &quot;In a strange way, I miss that year, because all those possibilities that existed then are gone. It didn&apos;t seem unlikely to me that he could walk through a door, or could appear behind a bush. It was a year of very magical thinking&quot; [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072544/http://www.amazon.com/Year-Magical-Thinking-Joan-Didion/dp/140004314X">Didion shout out</a>] &quot;and in some ways, I am sad to be moving further and further away from it.&quot;</p>

(Ladies, be sure to stick to the 4-minute mark when her <em>Blue Valentine</em> co-star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072544/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/10/video_ryan_gosling.php">Ryan Gosling</a> shows up.)
