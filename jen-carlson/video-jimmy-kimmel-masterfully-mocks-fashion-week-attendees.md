<p>Jimmy Kimmel has done it again. &quot;It&quot; being making certain humans of the world look like complete frauds, afraid of being shunned for not being In The Know about Whatever Important Thing is happening right now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308112235/http://laist.com/2013/04/23/video_jimmy_kimmel_asks_coachella_f.php">He did this at Coachella</a>, and this week he sent out a correspondent to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308112235/http://gothamist.com/tags/nyfw">New York Fashion Week</a> to ask attendees what they think about designers. None of the designers exist, but that did not stop the fashion devotees from commenting on them. </p>

<p>For example, when one is asked if she&apos;s into George Costanza, she responds, &quot;Yeah, I&apos;ve heard of him... I like more of his style, I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;d buy his clothes,&quot; which the correspondent points out are really more for short people anyway. Plus not everyone enjoys being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308112235/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imgGyD6waTA">draped in velvet</a>.</p>

<p>As for Christian Louboutin&apos;s new UniBoot&#x2014;that&apos;s one boot for two feet, also fictional&#x2014;at least two people asked said they&apos;d give it a shot&#x2014;&quot;If it&apos;s a fashion and a trend I may try it.&quot;</p>
