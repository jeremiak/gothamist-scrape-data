title: No Plans For Judgment Day? Five Places To Watch The World End In NYC
---

	
										<p><em>An army of Christians have been sounding off about the End of Days lately (according to them, it&apos;s this Saturday May 21st... however, according to <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em>, there&apos;s an apocalypse at least once a television season). Anyway, you&apos;ve seen the subway posters and billboards... but have you made plans yet? Because Judgment Day is nearly upon us, and you don&apos;t want to be stuck at home eating leftovers. Here are our top five picks on where to watch in New York, and don&apos;t forget to send us your photos of true Christians floating to heaven (or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr!).</em></p>

The rest of us will be doomed, as \"there\'s no more salvation at that point. And then the Bible says it will be 153 days later that the entire universe and planet Earth will be destroyed forever.\"\r\n\<p\>\r\nWhile considering where to spend the End of Days, keep in mind you want to have a view of the bodies floating to heaven, but you also might want to have shelter in case it rains that day.
