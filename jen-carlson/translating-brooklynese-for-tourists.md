title: Translating Brooklynese For Tourists

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bkdictionary.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151116220631im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bkdictionary.jpg" width="200" height="306" class="image-left"> </span>Do you speak fluent Brooklynese? Well fuhgeddaboutdit, you just found yourself a new job. A London-based company called Today Translations has posted an ad on Craigslist seeking speakers of the borough&apos;s native language, which can&apos;t be found in any dictionary. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151116220631/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/04/29/2010-04-29_untitled__2brooklyn29m.html">the Daily News</a> the freelance gig will pay up to $210/day to those who have knowledge in Brooklyn&apos;s &quot;accent, slang, and nuances.&quot; Such Brooklynisms can often be challenging for tourists, with the ad calling attention to phrases like: &quot;not for nothin,&apos;&quot; &quot;cawfee&quot; and &quot;whatayagonna do?&quot;</p>

<p>The paper talked to some locals, who found the ad amusing for the most part&#x2014;though one turned the tables, saying, &quot;I have a tenant from England and I can&apos;t understand a fucking word he says.&quot; He also admitted that whenever he leaves the city nobody understands him, recalling, &quot;I almost got locked up in Canada. You say one thing. They don&apos;t understand you. They lock you up.&quot; Hmm, let&apos;s hope Brooklynese translation makes it to the Mounties.</p>
