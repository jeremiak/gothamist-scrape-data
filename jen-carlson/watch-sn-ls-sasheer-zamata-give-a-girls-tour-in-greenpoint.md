                            <p>A couple of weeks ago SNL announced they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223065836/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/06/snl_casts_black_female_cast_member.php">had cast Sasheer Zamata</a> as their first black female cast member in quite some time. <em>Too long a time</em>, really. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223065836/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/19/videos_drake_impresses_doing_double.php">made her debut</a> this past Saturday, but if you didn&apos;t get enough of her on your screen, this below video will serve a more solid introduction if you aren&apos;t already familiar with the UCB alum. Here she is playing Madison, a girl giving tours of &quot;the revolutionary show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223065836/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The video&#x2014;shot in December&#x2014;comes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223065836/http://www.aboveaverage.com/">Above Average</a>, an online comedy video network part of the Broadway Video family (the production company behind SNL, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, &amp; Portlandia)... so maybe they&apos;ll bring Madison to Studio 8H?</p>
