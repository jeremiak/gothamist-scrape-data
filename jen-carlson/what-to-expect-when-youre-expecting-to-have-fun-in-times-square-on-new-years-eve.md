<p>If we&apos;re to believe Hollywood, then this New Year&apos;s Eve in Times Square is going to be simply <em>magical</em>. But you won&apos;t find Jon Bon Jovi or that girl from <em>Glee</em> in the spotlight, instead, the lights will be shining on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104103414/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/justin_bieber_and_lady_gaga_to_make.php">Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber</a>. That&apos;s right, this year organizers were like &quot;How can we make Times Square MORE of a clusterfuck this New Year&apos;s Eve?&quot; And then they booked two of the biggest pop stars, with two of the most rabid fanbases in the universe. Should you choose to be a part of this moment in time, here&apos;s what you can expect:<br>
</p><ul><li><strong>PUBLIC TRANSIT:</strong> Streets will be closed off in Midtown, preventing cabs and buses from accessing certain areas. On top of that, certain subway entrances and exits will be closed between 7 p.m. and midnight. Don&apos;t expect to be able to exit the Times Square-42nd Street station between 10 p.m. and midnight (unless you walk to 8th Avenue). After the ball drop, subway lines around Times Square will have trains running every 8 to 12 minutes until around 3 a.m., and the 42nd Street shuttle will be running.<br>
</li><li><strong>MILD WEATHER:</strong> One million revelers are expected... though probably more due to the nice weather (sunny with a high of 50). It&apos;s expected to be around 41 when the ball drops.<br>
</li><li><strong>YOUR NEW BEST FRIENDS:</strong> Seriously <em>huge</em> crowds. President of the Times Square Alliance, Tim Tompkins, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104103414/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/huge_square_dance_eWz3HkhJYCWNmog0AxudPI#ixzz1i2EfEPMh">the NY Post</a> huge crowds are also expected because, &#x201C;Ten years after 9/11, New York has more than regained its swagger, with crime down, tourism up and people feeling good about the city&#x2019;s trajectory.&quot; Expect to grow to love or hate the people standing next to you.<br>
</li><li><strong>SHINY THINGS:</strong> 32,000 lights on the Waterford Crystal ball, which you can gaze at as the dude next to you pukes on your shoes. There will also be a bright &quot;2012,&quot; and you can check out some video of the numeral 2 making its entrance into Times Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104103414/http://timessquareball.net/press/Numeral%202%20delivery%20and%20installation/Numeral%202%20B%20Roll%20SD.mov">right here</a>.<br>
</li><li><strong>COLORFUL THINGS:</strong> 16 million pieces of confetti, including wishes from the Wishing Wall (you can still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104103414/http://timessquarenyc.org/">submit one online</a> before 5 p.m. today).<br>
</li><li><strong>THE MAN:</strong> Thousands of police officers, including more than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104103414/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/12/30/national/a084531S48.DTL">1,500 rookies</a> who are probably just itching to use that pepper spray.<br>
</li><li><strong>THIS:</strong> A Mayor Bloomberg and Lady Gaga photo-op, as the two hit the button that drops the ball at 11:59 p.m. We hope she dresses as Staten Island Chuck.<br>
</li><li><strong>CELEBRATORY GUNFIRE?:</strong> Police commissioner Ray Kelly says that all over the city, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re also concerned about a phenomenon we&#x2019;ve seen quite frankly in previous years, celebratory gunfire. We urge people not to do that. The bullets come down and hit people. We&#x2019;ve seen that happen in years go by.&#x2019;&#x2019;</li></ul><p></p>
