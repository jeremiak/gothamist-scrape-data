<p>Happy Birthday to Canadian boy wonder Justin Bieber, who turns 17-years-old today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155002/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658926/justin-bieber-birthday.jhtml">MTV</a> (who earlier today had posted February 29th as his birthday, but have since fixed) asked around to find out what some New York City establishments would do if they were hosting his bash&#x2014;most included 3-D and &quot;intimate&quot; groups of 300. </p>

<p>For the big day, the little man&apos;s been asking that his Beliebers donate to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155002/http://mycharitywater.org/p/campaign?campaign_id=13922">Charity: Water</a> (he&apos;s already raised about $28,000); he&apos;s also hoping his grandma makes him some cherry cheesecake, which he declares is &quot;the best.&quot; (Apparently 17 isn&apos;t the year that Justin makes his transition into &quot;bad boy.&quot;) Also he is probably doing this in front of the mirror all day?:</p>

<p>According to an E! True Hollywood story we once accidentally watched, most of us have only known about Bieber since mid-2009&#x2014;which means it&apos;s <em>only been two years</em>. But be warned young Bieber, one minute you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155002/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOyfZMHohkM&amp;feature=player_embedded">dating Selena Gomez</a>, the next you&apos;re looking like Mick Jagger.</p>
