										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="drapersoup0412.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170225im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/drapersoup0412.jpg" width="640" height="468" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We just received this late-breaking press release, and it was too delicious to keep to ourselves:</p><blockquote>&quot;I was just informed that Jon Hamm is currently eating at Lansky&#x2019;s Jewish Deli on the Upper West Side eating Lansky&#x2019;s famous matzo ball soup by himself in the front window of the deli.  He was wearing a baseball cap, black sunglasses, plaid shirt, full beard, jeans and a black blazer.<p></p>

<p>Wanted to see if we could get the item on Gothamist.com for any spotted sections you might be posting? &quot;</p></blockquote>Why yes, we can certainly find room for this hot Jon Hamm <em>item</em>! Unfortunately, by the time you read this, Hamm won&apos;t be there anymore. (In fact, Gothamist&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170225/https://twitter.com/#!/jenchung/status/192740645310431232">Jen Chung</a> immediately raced over there and by that time he was already gone.) But if you want to find a lonely Jon Hamm eating matzo ball soup, now you know where to stalk. We also hear George Clooney was sitting at the counter drinking a Coke, and Ryan Gosling was fixing a clogged toilet! <p></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 6:42 p.m.:</strong> Back from the front, Chung, ever the optimist, files this report:  &quot;Upside of not seeing John Hamm &#x2014; he didn&apos;t see me wincing because of all the lactic acid in my calves from trying to sprint there in unsuitable shoes.&quot; </p>
