<p>Carsten H&#xF6;ller&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155519/http://gothamist.com/tags/carstenh%C3%B6ller">Experience exhibit</a> opened at the New Museum this week with much excitement, mostly centered around the 102-foot-long slide that visitors can go down. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155519/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/25/the_new_museums_giant_slide_is_here.php">the entire exhibit</a> is pretty unusual and unprecedented, even including a sensory deprivation tank, called the &quot;Psycho Tank.&quot; Inside, visitors float around, often naked, with other visitors, and unsurprisingly the Department of Health has now put an end to that. Even worse: now they&apos;re eying the slide. </p>

<p>Turns out the New Museum didn&apos;t get permits for any of this, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155519/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/health_dept_no_sharing_ZsQ2HPrmplviRxjdAwzi3H">the NY Post</a>, city officials came knocking yesterday. Now only one person at a time is allowed in the tank&#x2014;a rule the museum itself instituted after the DoH &quot;advised them of the requirements in the Health Code and the conditions that would require approval and a permit.&quot; Visitors also must continue to sign a form saying they don&apos;t have any conditions or diseases that can be passed along in the water. </p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect the city to be appeased by that gesture however, officials are still investigating, and now they&apos;ve got their eye on the slide and carousel, which may not meet safety standards. (But, one of theme&apos;s in H&#xF6;ller&apos;s the exhibit is <em>safety</em>!) We&apos;ve contacted the New Museum for comment on any further changes they may have to make, and will update when we hear back&#x2014;but we suggest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155519/http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/449">spending the day there</a> before the city starts pulling out the red tape.</p>
