The artist, in short, shot a dog (that he adopted) for the sake of &quot;art&quot; -- something he did, and filmed, 20 years ago.</p>

<p>He&apos;s apologized for the unforgivable act, but with each new piece he creates or installs -- it seems his past will always come back to haunt him. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023005040/http://mcbrooklyn.blogspot.com/2008/04/tom-otterness-apologizes-for-shooting.html">Here is one of his latest emails addressing the situation</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;As you must understand this is a very difficult and painful situation for me. Thirty years ago when I was 25 years old, I made a film in which I shot a dog. It was an indefensible act that I am deeply sorry for.<p></p>

<p>Many of us have experienced profound emotional turmoil and despair. Few have made the mistake I made.</p>

<p>I hope people can find it in their hearts to forgive me.</p>

<p>Tom Otterness&quot;</p></blockquote>Is the apology enough? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023005040/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=27&amp;id=19895">The Brooklyn Eagle</a> doubts it was the one many were hoping for. In the meantime, there are still &quot;artists&quot; killing innocent animals; Guillermo Vargas Habacuc tied a dog up, put it on display in a gallery, and starved him to death -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023005040/http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/134292.asp">something that will be repeated</a> at the  Centroamerican Art Biennial this year. <p></p>
