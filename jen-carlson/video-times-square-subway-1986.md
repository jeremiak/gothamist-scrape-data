										<p>We&apos;ve looked back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429005904/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/08/flashback_times_square_1986.php">Times Square in 1986</a> before, but that was above ground... what was happening underneath all the action? One tourist from the time just uploaded his 25 year old footage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429005904/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzCQ_l_RWTE&amp;feature=player_embedded">YouTube</a>, saying while on a visit he &quot;was going in the underground at 43nd St &amp; Times Square&quot; to film. He recently &quot;opened my archive once again with the original film and composed it with the original stereo sound to this over 10 minutes long &apos;directors cut&apos; of all scenes I filmed at this day in June 1986. Enjoy it!&quot;</p>

<p>He also notes someone told him filming was illegal in the subway without permission, which of course, isn&apos;t true... at least not in these modern times, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429005904/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/nypd_get_lesson_in_photography.php"><em>right</em>, NYPD</a>?
