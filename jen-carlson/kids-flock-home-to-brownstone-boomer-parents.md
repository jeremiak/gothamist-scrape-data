Didn&apos;t we all see this coming with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191244/http://imdb.com/title/tt0265666"><em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em></a>?</p>

<p>One Carroll Gardens family, the Eisenbergs, have seen their three daughters return for varying amounts of time -- they are, of course, just one small section of a new generation of kids returning to the nest nationwide. As opposed to some other places in the county, however, they get rent-free living in expensive, &quot;hip&quot; neighborhoods.</p><blockquote>A few factors drive this phenomenon. The Brooklyn neighborhoods where these graduates grew up have become hip places to live, and rents there and throughout New York City have skyrocketed. &#x201C;Another important thing, I think, is that the clash in values between parents and their grown children is not as extreme as it once was,&#x201D; Rusti [Eisenberg[] said.</blockquote>One of the Eisenberg flock even brought her boyfriend home to live in the Henry Street home for three years! For the most part this is a strategy to save money and buy a room of one&apos;s own someday, one 20-something interviewed in the article pointed out that, &#x201C;The amount I saved while living at home was enough for a down payment on an apartment&quot; (a studio in along Prospect Park West for $130,000 in 2002, sold in 2006 for double that amount).<p></p>
