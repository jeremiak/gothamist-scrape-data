                            <p>The Guggenheim sent out a press release yesterday the size of <em>The Fountainhead</em> describing their upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102185141/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/upcoming/frank-lloyd-wright">Frank Lloyd Wright: From Within Outward</a> exhibition (opening in May and running through August). In celebration of the building&apos;s 50 year anniversary the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation has helped them piece together the installation, which will present 64 projects designed by Wright, all displayed on the spiral ramps of the museum he designed. The CEO of the foundation says that, &quot;Rather than a retrospective, this exhibition focuses on the diversity of Wright&apos;s vision and the ways he sought to realize it...The concept of the exhibition also reflects a growing recognition of the enormous relevance today of Frank Lloyd Wright&apos;s design philosophies, which embrace culture, technology and environment.&quot; Sad fact: Wright actually died six months prior to the grand opening of the Guggenheim.</p>
