<p>Sometime around Cinco de Mayo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162742/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/03/lobo_giving_mexican_food_in_nyc_an.php">we wondered</a> where the best and worst Mexican food could be found in New York City. As you can see by the hefty number of 3.5 ratings below, we&apos;re never going to really have <em>the best</em> Mexican food here, but we can at least come up with a comprehensive list of decent places. </p>

<p>Our previous post was inspired by a terribly bland and soggy experience at Lobo on Court Street in Brooklyn&#x2014;and since no one deserves to get Lobo&apos;d, we asked for your suggestions on the best and worst places that serve Mexican food here. Below are the lists that you helped generate, as well as polls where you can cast your final vote for &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst.&quot;</p>
