This is the first structure to be demolished by implosion in the city in over a decade. And the destruction will be streamed live on the internet! Though we&apos;d recommend watching it live with your own eyes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228232847/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/28/bloomberg_wont_shut_up_about_how_th.php">from the romantic Staten Island Ferry</a>. <p></p>

<p>The Trust for Governors Island (known more ominously as simply: The Trust) announced today that the non-historic building, located on the island&apos;s southern end, will be imploded on the morning of June 9th. Ronay Menschel, Chair of The Trust for Governors Island, says, &quot;The demolition of Building 877 is a major milestone in the transformation of Governors Island. A beautiful sports field will be constructed in the space cleared of this building as part of the Island&#x2019;s new park.  The public will enjoy glorious views of the Statue of Liberty from all points in the park.&quot;</p>

<p>The building is from 1968, and is also known as the Cunningham Apartments, which housed 165 duplex apartments for members of the Coast Guard and their families. It has been vacant since 1996, has been abandoned since, and &quot;does not comply with local or state building codes, was constructed with unacceptable levels of out of date materials.&quot; So the only solution is a summer blockbuster implosion event! Which they promise will bring at least 30 seconds of visual excitement. </p>

<p>Following that, &quot;The Trust is moving forward with the transformation of 30 acres formerly closed to the public into new park. This park includes Liggett Terrace, a sunny, six acre plaza with seasonal plantings, seating, water features and public art; Hammock Grove, a shady ten acre space that is home to 1,500 new trees, play areas and hammocks; and the Play Lawn, 14 acres for play and relaxation that includes two turf ball fields sized for adult softball and Little League baseball.  Construction of these 30 acres is on schedule for completion later this year.&quot; You had us at &quot;hammocks,&quot; The Trust, <em>&quot;you had us at hammocks.&quot;</em></p>
