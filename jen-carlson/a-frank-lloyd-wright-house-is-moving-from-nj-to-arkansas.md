<p>One of the houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright that&apos;s actually within an hour of NYC will soon be a plane trip away. The Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195934/http://crystalbridges.org/press-releases/crystal-bridges-museum-american-art-acquires-rare-frank-lloyd-wright-house-preserves-architectural-treasure/">has purchased</a> Wright&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195934/http://bachmanwilsonhouse.com/">Bachman Wilson House</a> in Somerset County, NJ. They hope to have the home on their property by next year. </p>

<p>Built in 1954, the 2,000-square-foot-house originally belonged to chemist and lawyer Abraham Wilson and his wife Gloria Bachman. The couple &quot;wrote to Wright, asking him to design a house for them, and later met with the architect at the Plaza Hotel in New York, while he was working on the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The resulting design reflects Wright&#x2019;s Usonian period: a work of art in simplicity and form, representing organic design principles.&quot; </p>

<p>It was restored by its most recent owners, but after suffering flooding damage from the nearby Millstone River, they decided to sell it in 2012 for an asking price of $1.5 million... as long as the buyer would move the house to a new location. </p>

<p>You can see the home in more detail below (the home is a private residence and no tours are given). When it relocates, the furniture and fixtures will be going with it. </p>
