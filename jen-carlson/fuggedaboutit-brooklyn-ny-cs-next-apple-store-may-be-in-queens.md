<p>While Marty Markowitz has been lobbying for an Apple store in Brooklyn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144327/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/08/marty_markowitz_uses_ipad_to_beg_fo.php">for years</a>, that borough may be one of the last to get one. Currently Manhattan has five Apple stores (the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144327/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/more_photos_of_the_grand_central_ap.php">in Grand Central</a>), Staten Island has one, and it turns out Queens may be next on the list. Forest Hills, to be exact. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144327/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-aims-apple-core-article-1.1007252">the Daily News</a>, real estate developer Yeheskel Elias is in preliminary talks with the company about opening one of their stores on Austin Street in Forest Hills. And if a deal is reached, the store could open next year. Elias vowed, &#x201C;I will do anything I can to bring Apple in. Queens has to have an Apple store.&#x201D; Oh well, at least you got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144327/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/brooklyn_shake_shack_now_open_with.php">a Shake Shack</a>, Marty.</p>

<p>For now, Apple says they have no announcements to make about upcoming stores in New York City.</p>
