While she had described her former job as &quot;<em>burlesque</em> dancer,&quot; she is now taking off her tops and bottoms for the masses at Scores right here in New York. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110518083856/http://www.tmz.com/2011/05/16/danielle-staub-stripper-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-nj-naked-nude-photos-pictures-scores/">According to TMZ</a>, she&apos;s signed a three-year contract in which she &quot;agreed to do one live appearance and occasionally appear on ScoresLive.com.&quot; The club sent over some very NSFW photos of the 48-year-old on the pole, and you can click through to view them&#x2014;we have censored them for you (you&apos;re welcome).</p>
