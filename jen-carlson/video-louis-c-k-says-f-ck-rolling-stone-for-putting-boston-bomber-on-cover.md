<p>In April of this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144428/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> landed on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144428/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/louis-c-k-im-an-accidental-white-person-20130411">the cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, but last night during his appearance on <em>The Daily Show</em> he came down on the magazine for putting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144428/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/17/rolling_stone_cover_has_people_sayi.php">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on their cover</a>, looking like a dreamy &apos;70s acid rocker. C.K. told host John Oliver: &quot;They put that kid on the cover that blew up Boston, so fuck them.&quot; You can watch the clip below, where he also addresses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144428/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/22/royal_baby.php">the Royal Baby hype</a>: &quot;I don&apos;t understand why it&apos;s a big deal. There were 50 babies born in Brooklyn today, probably. This baby was born with a castle, already. With <em>a couple</em> of castles.&quot;</p>
