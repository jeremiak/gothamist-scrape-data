Salinger of Canadian comedy,&quot; at his Upper West Side home. The now 60-year-old actor ducked out of the spotlight many years ago, but is somewhat back with a new album, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731150634/http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Brisket-Other-Love-Songs/dp/B00CPKZLF2"><em>My Mother&#x2019;s Brisket &amp; Other Love Songs</em></a>. We highly recommend reading the entire thing, but here are some great life notes we took away from it.</p>

<ul><li><strong>On livin&apos; life:</strong> &quot;I don&#x2019;t particularly like travel, and I do like home. I like to consume music alone and films alone. I read books alone. Why wouldn&#x2019;t I consume other art alone? I always eat earlier than everyone, and I don&#x2019;t like restaurants. By the time I take everything out of the food they serve, primarily the butter and the salt, it&#x2019;s not very tasty. But I wasn&#x2019;t always like this. I don&#x2019;t recommend this as a lifestyle to a young person.&quot;
</li><li><strong>On dating websites:</strong> &quot;What picture would I use? The guy from <em>Ghostbusters</em>? I don&#x2019;t think dating sites work for people with famous punims.&quot;
</li><li><strong>On how we&apos;re all gonna die alone anyway:</strong> &quot;You have to want to meet somebody, you can&#x2019;t be shy and you have to put work into it. You have to say to people, fix me up! Do you know anybody? If you&#x2019;re not going to wind up with your childhood sweetheart or the person you went to med school with or whatever, then you either have to get really lucky bumping into somebody. Or you have to be doing the things you love and encounter someone who also enjoys those things. And you can begin to build some history together. The older you get, I think the harder it gets.&quot;
</li><li><strong>On how print will be saved:</strong> &quot;I just love when the Internet is wrong. It&#x2019;s the only thing that will save journalism.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>Maybe it&apos;s because of our old soul, but this interview made us swoon. More Moranis, please.</p>
