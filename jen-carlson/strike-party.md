C&apos;mon, speak up! If not, you have pretty much the same options as you had yesterday (just more localized to where you live) Stay In or Go Out...</p>

<p>Stay In: Watch tv. It&apos;s okay, you walked all day. Take a load off, order some popcorn from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522063834/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/11/29/maxdeliverycom_1.php">maxdelivery.com</a> and check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522063834/http://online.tvguide.com/listings/?rnd=705.5475">the Guide</a>. Our picks...</p>

<blockquote>TBS (8) From 8pm to 11pm you can catch back to back&apos;s of the most un-city NYC shows: <em>Friends</em> and <em>Sex &amp; the City</em>. You can make a drinking game out of it and take a shot every time the characters DON&apos;T get on the subway. 

<p>NYC TV (25) has a Secrets of New York documentary on covering the oldest bridges and cemeteries. 8pm.</p>

<p>MTV (20) If all else fails, there&apos;s always the Laguna Beach marathon on MTV. 8pm to indefinitely!</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Go Out: Would you rather commiserate with other pedestrians at the end of the day? We don&apos;t foresee any problems with bands not making it to venues tonight. Around town New York locals Saints + Lovers, Kimya Dawson and A.R.E. Weapons are playing - and we think they are all tough enough to make it to their respective venues. [More shows listed @ our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522063834/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/12/19/the_pitas_weekl_1.php">picks for the week</a>.] If the rock isn&apos;t your thing, then organize a happy hour at your local bar and look on the brightside: you didn&apos;t have to touch that disgusting subway pole today.  </p>

<p>So what are you doing tonight? Seriously, someone HAS to have a strike party!</p>

<p><em>Of note: All major tourist attractions are scheduled to remain open. So don&apos;t let the stike stop you from checking out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522063834/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/12/15/darwin.php">the Darwin Exhibit</a>!</em></p>
