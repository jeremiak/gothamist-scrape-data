</div></div><p>With so much talk of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185341/http://gothamist.com/tags/trolley">trolleys</a> coming back to New York (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185341/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/streetcar_study_now_underway.php">at least in Brooklyn</a>), here&apos;s a snapshot of what our city streets looked like when they were originally here. Can you guess which year this photo was taken? We&apos;ll update later with the answer and more details.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This photo was taken in 1910. More photos, with their captions, of street cars and trolleys from that time have been added.</p>
