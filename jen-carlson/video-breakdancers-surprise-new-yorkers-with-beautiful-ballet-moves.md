<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108133805/http://improveverywhere.com/2015/08/04/unexpected-ballet/">Improv Everywhere</a> crew recently added a little ballet to NYC breakdancing. Enlisting professional ballet performers to pose as breakdancers in Washington Square Park, the dancers &quot;hype up their tumbling routine to a gathered crowd before realizing they brought the &apos;wrong music.&apos;&quot; And it all unfolds beautifully from there.</p>

<p>Why didn&apos;t they pretend to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108133805/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/29/two_showtime_dancers_give_us_the_lo.php">showtime dancers</a> and bring this prank underground? Improv Everywhere impresario Charlie Todd answers that: &quot;For years I&#x2019;ve wanted to stage a project on the subway where ballet dancers show up on a train car pretending to be &apos;showtime&apos; performers and then suddenly break into an awesome ballet routine instead of the normal tumbling and subway pole acrobatics. Each time it would come up I&#x2019;d talk myself out of it over safety concerns. The subway is really not an ideal place to do ballet moves.&quot; But C&apos;MON, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108133805/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/07/its_showtime_in_forest.php">those moves</a> are no more space-consuming than what the showtime guys do.</p>
