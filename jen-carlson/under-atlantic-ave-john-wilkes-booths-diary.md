<p>The plan is to bust through a wall in the tunnel, to get to another portion of the passageway where one, all or none of the following items may be discovered: an old steam locomotive, John Wilkes Booth&#x2019;s diary (that will obviously &quot;reveal who hired him to shoot Abraham Lincoln&quot;), vampires, the bones of bomb-making German solidiers, and probably Jimmy Hoffa.</p>

<p>Booth&apos;s diary is clearly the bold-faced-item here, and it&apos;s not entirely absurd to think it may be found underneath the busy Brooklyn street; &quot;historical novelist G.J.A. O&#x2019;Toole wrote in his 1979 detective thriller <em>The Cosgrove Report</em>, that the missing pages of the assassin&#x2019;s journal were hidden in a steel box under Atlantic Avenue. Next to a lost steam locomotive.&quot; The explorer declared, &#x201C;They could be in there. The first time I crawled into that tunnel, I felt like Indiana Jones. I am nervous with anticipation of what will happen this time.&#x201D; Dun dun dun! Now we wait til winter.</p>
