On Tuesday a store called KamaSutra opened in the neighborhood, and now locals <em>and</em> a local politician are rallying against it. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141411/http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2010/08/sheepshead-sex-shops-opening-slammed-by-neighbors/">the area blog</a>, the risqu&#xE9; window display is, perhaps, a little too provocative. <p></p>

<p>The shop, owned by a man going by the name of &quot;John,&quot; sells lingerie, sex toys, novelties, massage oils, and of course, water pipes&#x2014;for when you want the <em>total</em> experience. &quot;John&quot; told the blog, &#x201C;A place like this is going to work anywhere. We&#x2019;re all the same. We all use lingerie, we use toys. This can work anywhere.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The store is on the same stretch as a ballet studio, a karate studio, and a kids&apos; store, however&#x2014;which may not be the best area to be hawking dildos. But since the store doesn&apos;t stock pornographic magazines and videos, or have live shows, they can stay put... until the townsfolk come torch the place, that is.</p>
