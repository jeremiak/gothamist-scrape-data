<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103115359/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/27/yule_logs_embers_eyed_in_fatal_stam.php">depressing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103115359/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/27/former_saturday_night_live_writer_c.php">headlines</a> out there today, so let&apos;s think of something positive. We stumbled across this old photo from 1931, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103115359/http://gothamist.com/tags/prohibition">during Prohibition</a>, of illegal beer kegs being smashed somewhere in New York City. A tragic sight! The sound of the foam seeping into the unappreciative soil will haunt our dreams tonight, but at least the Great Beer Massacre of 1931 is all in the past. </p>

<p>So, the next time you get the blues and your hugging machine isn&apos;t around, think about this: at least we have beer. Sweet, nectar of the gods, beer. And it&apos;s perfectly legal (if you are 21 or older) to drink it, and even store it in kegs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103115359/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/25/kegs_in_the_city.php">in your apartment</a>.</p>
