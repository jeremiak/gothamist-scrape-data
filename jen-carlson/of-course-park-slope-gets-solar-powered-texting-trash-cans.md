title: Of Course: Park Slope Gets Solar Powered, Texting Trash Cans
---

	
										<p>First <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618174244/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/18/spotted_catpack_in_park_slope.php">catpacks</a>, and now solar garbage cans... what <em>can&apos;t</em> Park Slope deliver? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618174244/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/solar-garbage-cans-coming-to-park-slope-hippies-rejoice.html">FIPS</a>, some &quot;Big Belly solar powered garbage cans are going to be installed in various spots along Fifth Avenue. They are apparently each outfitted with a solar powered trash compactor, which reduces the need to empty them as much.&quot; </p>

<p>Big Belly trash cans<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618174244/http://gothamist.com/2005/03/03/big_belly_on_chambers_street.php"> have been around for a while</a>, but it seems like they&apos;re popping up in more places. THis video shows how the Big Belly can can fit 5 cans into 1 can, and when it&apos;s finally full <em>it sends a text message</em> to the powers that be to come and empty it. The company makes it <em>seem</em> like Oscar the Grouch endorses these things in the video below, but they would create a very inhospitable environment for Oscar to live in, don&apos;t ya think?</p>
