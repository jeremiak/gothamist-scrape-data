<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406183913/http://www.woostercollective.com/2009/08/judith_supines_above_the_city_in_a_summe.html">the Wooster Collective</a> posted a few photos of Judith Supine way at the tippy top of the Williamsburg Bridge, hanging his piece titled: &quot;Above the City in a Summer Night Dream.&quot; This one seemed like a much more dangerous project than previous pieces (for example the fifty-foot-tall piece he hung over the side of the very same bridge, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406183913/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/05/judith_supine_t.php">two years ago</a> he lowered one off the Manhattan Bridge). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406183913/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/supine_takes_a_dip_in_central_park.php">Again</a>, we challenge Supine to bring his next piece into the Gowanus Canal.</p>
