The stamp will feature a photo taken by Rollie McKenna, and will be released next year; the reverse side of the sheet will feature samples from the poet&apos;s work.</p>

<p>Plath took her own life in 1963 by gassing herself (legend has it she stuck her head in the oven) after her husband Ted Hughes&#x2014;who never had <em>his</em> own stamp (pretty sure?)&#x2014;moved in with her friend Assia Wevill. The Guardian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225704/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/18/sylviaplath-tedhughes">notes</a> that after her death, the Hughes name was often scratched off of her headstone by her fans.</p>

<p>There will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225704/http://www.examiner.com/literature-in-national/poetry-forever-usps-unveils-2012-poet-stamps-plath-roethke-cummings-more">nine other stamps</a> dedicated to poets, as well&#x2014;they will feature: Joseph Brodsky, Gwendolyn Brooks, William Carlos Williams, Robert Hayden, Elizabeth Bishop, Wallace Stevens, Denise Levertov, e. e. cummings, and Theodore Roethke. </p>

<p>In other Plath news, could that Julia Stiles <em>Bell Jar</em> movie finally be coming out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225704/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844467/">next year</a>?</p>
