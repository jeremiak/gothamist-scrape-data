<p>On Sunday night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130221000442/http://gothamist.com/tags/doordine">Do Or Dine</a>&apos;s Justin Warner (the &quot;Rebel with a Culinary Cause&quot;) took home the big prize and became the next <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130221000442/http://www.foodnetwork.com/justin-warner/index.html">Food Network Star</a> (thanks in part to his many fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130221000442/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/justin_warner.php">who voted</a> for him). After Warner&apos;s win, Food Network&apos;s senior VP said, &quot;Justin is a rule breaker in the best possible sense, much like his mentor Alton Brown. He approaches food with a quirky sense of joy that made him stand out from the very beginning of the season.&quot; </p>

<p>The 27-year-old&apos;s Bed-Stuy joint only opened a little over a year ago, and has already become successful <em>without</em> the help of national fame&#x2014;so will any of us ever be able to get a seat there again? Warner&#x2014;who will now go into production for his own Food Network show&#x2014;answered some of our more pressing questions this morning:</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s the next step for you now that you&apos;ve won?</strong> I&apos;m going to respond to a lot of emails.  I just took a tour of the Food Network offices, hung out on the set of <em>Iron Chef</em>.  We (the Network and I) have a lot to discuss.</p>

<p><strong>Will you get to film your show in NYC?</strong> It&apos;s still TBD.  Alton Brown has a studio and production company in Atlanta, so that&apos;s also a possibility. </p>

<p><strong>Will &quot;we&quot; ever be able to get a seat at Do Or Dine again?</strong> Oh yeah, we are rarely busy until 8 p.m. or so.  The best time to come is around 6, when we open.  If the weather is nice, we have additional seating on the patio.</p>

<p><strong>Can you give us a simple recipe (a summery dinner?) that people can cook in their cramped NYC kitchens?</strong> Miso paste + butter + corn + grill.  Bangin&apos;.*</p>

<p>*If you don&apos;t have a grill in your kitchen (the FDNY definitely frowns upon that), then just do your corn up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130221000442/http://notquitegourmet.blogspot.com/2012/04/corn-two-ways.html">on a skillet</a>.</p>
