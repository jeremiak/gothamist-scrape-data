The ad is part of their &quot;Why Pay More?&quot; campaign, and a Taco Bell rep addressed the debacle, saying, &quot;We made a good faith, charitable offer to 50 Cent to change his name to either 79, 89 or 99 Cent for one day by rapping his order at a Taco Bell, and we would have been very pleased to make the $10,000 donation to the charity of his choice.&quot; The problem is that 50 never agreed to it, and now Taco Bell may be left paying more than they bargained for as they face a $4 million lawsuit; the rapper wants payback for &quot;diluting the value of his good name.&quot;</p>
