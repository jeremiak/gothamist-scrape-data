Currently he&apos;s filming a new series with Will Arnett for Britain&apos;s Channel 4, and come this summer you&apos;ll be able to soak up his wisdom in the written word when his book &quot;I Drink For A Reason&quot; hits shelves. Recently he told us about the Arrested Development movie, an upcoming Squeakel, and what he thinks of a law banning fans from talking to him. Tomorrow night he&apos;ll return to the stage, joining Zach Galifianakis, Janeane Garofalo, Demetri Martin, John Oliver and Paul F. Tompkins for &#x201C;Stand-Ups Give BAC,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213259/https://www.carolines.com/#/page/event/130/stand-up-gives-bac-a-benefit-for-the-brooklyn-autism-center/">a benefit for the Brooklyn Autism Center</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did you spend Inauguration day/night?</strong> I was up at my house in the woods. No tv so my girlfriend and I drove down into town and watched it at a bar.</p>

<p><strong>Do you know about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213259/http://www.lindsayism.com/2006/06/davids_law.html">David&apos;s Law</a>?</strong> I did know about David&apos;s Law. A friend who works at the U.N. pointed it out to me. I didn&apos;t know it had passed. I thought it was still in the docket at The Hague. I will state here for the record that Lindsay is welcome to break that law whenever she pleases. I think I met her once at a &quot;Tinkle&quot; show (I think) and that she was lovely.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any stories about fans that you wish knew about David&apos;s Law?</strong> I have literally hundreds of stories but they are all so similar and only mildly irritating that they&apos;re not really worth repeating. Mostly garden variety rude, in-your-space, yelling &quot;Why do I know you&quot; type stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Do NYC transplants who grew up around rednecks treat you (more) like a savior?</strong> Yes! It&apos;s an instant conversation starter and for some reason I really get into the minutia of it (their experiences in conjunction with mine) and I wind up boring them I think.</p>
