<p>It&apos;s been (somewhat awkwardly) announced that Justin Timberlake will be hosting the season finale of Saturday Night Live this year. He&apos;ll be closing out the 36th season on May 21st, according to a Tweet from the show that has now been deleted! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528125503/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/19/justin-timberlake-on-saturday-night-live_n_851201.html">HuffPo</a>, it went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>When a Twitter follower wrote, &quot;I didn&#x2019;t realize that @nbcsnl isn&#x2019;t back until May 7th!!! What am I going to do!? Is Tina Fey the season finale!?&quot; the show responded, &quot;Nope! We have Timberlake after that!&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This makes it the third time Timberlake has hosted the show (if we&apos;re to believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528125503/http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110307153131AA1TgHH">Yahoo! Answers</a>... and why wouldn&apos;t we?). This means he&apos;s <em>soclose</em> to being a part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528125503/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Timers_Club">Five-Timers Club</a> (and at such a young age!), though he currently ranks closer to Paul Simon, also splitting his duties between music-oriented cameos and acting. Check out the Kings of SNL below (there are only <em>two women</em> in the Five-Timer Club).</p>
