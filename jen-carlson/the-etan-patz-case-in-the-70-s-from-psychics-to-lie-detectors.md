</div></div>					<p>Yesterday we checked out the New York Public Library&apos;s microfilm room to find some old articles not available online regarding the Etan Patz case. The 6-year-old was kidnapped 33 years ago, and yesterday the FBI and NYPD set up a new crime scene on Prince Street, where the Patz family still lives. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233819/http://gothamist.com/tags/etanpatz">catch up on the ongoing story right here</a>, but right now we&apos;ll look back at how the case was handled and reported in the late &apos;70s.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="php2k5koaAM.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233819im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php2k5koaAM.jpeg" width="350" height="132" class="image-right"> </span>At the time, Detective William Butler was dedicated to solving the crime, and was reported to have become like a father to the rest of the Patz family. The NY Post wrote, &quot;Every day Detective William Butler retraces the route that the 6-year-old should have taken on that Friday morning two months ago when he disappeared. Starting at 7:30 a.m. [he] walks slowly back and forth for two hours on Prince Street: past a health food store, a resaurant, several art galleries, and a bakery. He is searching desperately for a witness or clue that might have been overlooked by the police.&quot; He told them, &quot;It&apos;s a long shot, but by now I feel like he&apos;s my own son, I can&apos;t give up.&quot;</p>

<p>Psychics were also coming in to help. It was reported that they were &quot;providing a wealth of clues in the search for 6-year-old Etan Patz, the SoHo youngster who disappeared five days ago. But thus far they&apos;ve all turned out to be dead ends. One of the psychics told the boy&apos;s exhausted father last night that she thought the first grader was in a &quot;blue&quot; hospital where there&apos;s a nurse named Mrs. Keanne.&quot;</p>

<p>Another psychic was hypnotized and thought the boy was &quot;living safely&quot; with a dark haired woman who spoke with a Spanish or Cuban accent and &quot;who lives on the second floor of a tenement building number 29.&quot; The NYPD followed all of the leads at the time, but were reported to have been &quot;frustrated.&quot;</p>

<p>There was also a tip that the boy was with relatives in Boston (in fact, his father Stan Patz didn&apos;t believe he was near their Prince Street home). Julie Patz&apos;s mother underwent a lie detector test at this time, but results were confidential. You can click through for the articles we unearthed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233819/http://nypl.org/">at the NYPL</a> yesterday, or head over there and dig through their microfilm files for an even closer look.</p>
