<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ratdemicgrandarmy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133534im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ratdemicgrandarmy.jpg" width="275" height="325" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133534/http://gothamist.com/tags/ratdemic">The ratdemic</a> has moved over to Brooklyn&apos;s Grand Army Plaza, where rats are allegedly holding court and scoffing at the Parks Departments efforts to poison them! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133534/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/17/2010-09-17_rats_havin_grand_time.html">the Daily News</a>, the rodents have taken to a wooded area at the northern end of the landmark (near Bailey Fountain) and are still running rampant even after the Parks Department baited the area with poison. </p>

<p>The rats aren&apos;t afraid to come out in daylight, either, and one local doorman told the paper, <strong>&quot;It&apos;s nasty. On the corner, I saw a rat as big as a rabbit.&quot;</strong> (Maybe it was a rabbit-rat hybrid!) Another local said that &quot;people are scared&quot; because the rats have taken over benches and trash cans. </p>

<p>Earlier this year the city cut down on pest control staff, when the Union representing pest control workers in the city declared: &quot;A lot of people are going to be seeing a lot of rats. It&apos;s going to take much longer to get vacant city lots cleaned up and to get rats exterminated. It&apos;s going to be a disaster. Rats are all over New York City, and we&apos;re just trying to contain it. We&apos;re going to have chaos in the city.&quot;</p>
