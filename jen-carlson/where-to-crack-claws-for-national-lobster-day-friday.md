<p>National Lobster Day is crawling up on us, and we&apos;re sinking our teeth into the delicious &quot;holiday&quot; early, with some recommendations on where to celebrate (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTO57M3KgA">Pinchy would have wanted it that way</a>). The big day is this Friday June 15th, and we&apos;re planning on stopping by at least one of these fine establishments:</p>

<p><strong>Ed&apos;s Lobster Bar and Annex</strong> is the place to go if you want to think outside the lobster shell. At the Annex (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://www.lobsterbarnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/EdsLobsterBar-Annex-Menu.pdf">PDF</a>), they serve up lobster meatballs, lobster tacos, and lobster sliders, while over at the Bar (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://www.lobsterbarnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/EdsLobsterBar-Menu.pdf">PDF</a>) they have lobster pot pie, lobster ravioli, and lobster burgers. And on Friday they&apos;ll be hosting a lobster feast starting at 4:30 p.m., where guests will have the chance sample 1 half chilled lobster, 2 mini rolls, 1 lobster ravioli, 1 lobster meatball slider, 1 lobster burger slider, 1 lobster taco, and a Bisque shooter.&quot; There will also be pickles, cole slaw, and a Bloody Mary with a claw garnish &quot;and a refreshing lobster ale to wash it all down.&quot; This costs $60.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://www.yelp.com/biz/carmines-new-york"><strong>Carmine&apos;s</strong></a> tells us their Lobster Fra Diavolo features &quot;a show-stopping array of lobster meat and pasta swimming in a fiery tomato sauce.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://www.yelp.com/biz/vai-restaurant-new-york"><strong>Vai</strong></a> on the Upper West Side is running a celebratory three-course menu on National Lobster Day, featuring Sauteed Lobster Fricasse.</p>

<p>If you want to loosen the pursestrings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://www.yelp.com/biz/l-ecole-new-york"><strong>L&apos;Ecole</strong></a> has those fancy (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/test_driving_the_rolls_royce_of_lob.php#photo-1">Gothamist approved</a>!) Fourchu lobsters ready and waiting for you.</p>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s nothing wrong with celebrating with a roll. Some of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php#photo-1">our favorites</a> include the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://redhooklobsterpound.com/"><strong>Red Hook Lobster Pound</strong></a>&apos;s&#x2014;which is $16, and served with either homemade mayo or slathered in butter on a split-top bun. At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://www.lukeslobster.com/menu/"><strong>Luke&apos;s Lobster</strong></a> you can get a $15 roll, with or without mayo, and with lemon butter (also served on a split-top bun). And don&apos;t forget to top it all off with a Lobster Bloody Mary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617163958/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/a_food_drink_tour_of_greenpoint.php?gallery0Pic=6#photo-20">in Greenpoint</a>.</p>
