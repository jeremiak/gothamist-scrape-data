<p><img alt="2007_07_arts_satc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182450im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_07_arts_satc.jpg" width="224" height="290" class="left">Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182450/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/24/sex_and_the_cit.php">in May we asked</a> what you thought of a Sex and the City movie, 51% of you thought it was coming three years too late. Whether we like it or not, the movie is going to happen - after Kim Cattrall finally signed on. Word is that she wanted a higher salary and a deal for a future HBO show, both of which she got. Guess her post-Samantha days haven&apos;t been filled with great roles (see: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182450/http://imdb.com/title/tt0396652/"><em>Ice Princess</em></a> with Michelle Trachtenberg).</p>

<p>The question now is, what will the plot-line be when the ladies hit the big screen? We have some ideas: </p>

<p>&#x2022; Samantha joins AARP (Cattrall is now 51!) and cheats on Smith with Andre Balazs.<br>
&#x2022; Charlotte considers having an affair with the manny.<br>
&#x2022; Miranda, as a Brooklyn resident, joins the fight to stop overdevelopment of the waterfront and to bring more F train service to Brooklyn.<br>
&#x2022; Carrie (whose shoe loyalties now go to Christian Louboutin) and Big consider adopting a baby from Africa.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182450/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117968051.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1">Variety</a> has an innuendo-filled article on the project, telling us HBO is &quot;getting in bed&quot; with New Line to get the film on the big screen after &quot;much foreplay&quot;. As for the cast, the original ladies are all back, along with Mario Cantone - though there&apos;s no word on Chris Noth or David Eigenberg. </p>

<p>We wonder what the movie promo in New York will be like. Will bars serve Flirtinis? Will the premiere be held during Fashion Week? Will a special Miranda-edition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182450/http://www.bugaboo.com/">Bugaboo</a> be released? </p>
