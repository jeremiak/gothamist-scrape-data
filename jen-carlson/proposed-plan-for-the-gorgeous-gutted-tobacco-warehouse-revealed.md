<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015736/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/12/empire_stores_warehouses_in_dumbo.php#photo-1">we got a look at</a> what the Empire Stores Warehouses may look like in the future, and now the proposed new look of their neighbor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015736/http://gothamist.com/tags/tobaccowarehouse">The Tobacco Warehouse</a> has been revealed.</p>

<p>Community groups, preservationists, and the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015736/http://broadwayworld.com/article/St-Anns-Warehouse-Unveils-Tobacco-Warehouse-Design-20130418">have begun to finalize the plan</a> for the building in Brooklyn Bridge Park, which was granted to St. Ann&apos;s Warehouse last year and will become the theater&apos;s future home. The architects at Rogers Marvel Architects are heading up the project, and presented these designs for the structure, which is now an abandoned open-air space <em>that is gorgeous just the way it is.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2tobaccoarehouse041.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015736im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2tobaccoarehouse041.jpg" width="640" height="362" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015736/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2013/04/18/theater_group_unveils_proposed_tobacco_warehouse_makeover.php">Curbed</a>, their plan &quot;would enclose the 18,000-square-foot enclosed building with &apos;a flexible performance space,&apos; plus another 1,000-square-foot multi-use space for local artists and community groups. The lobby will have access to Brooklyn Bridge Park, and the plan also includes a &apos;view corridor&apos; looking out at the park and the water.&quot; But some of the space will stay open&#x2014;a 7,600-square-foot triangular open space &quot;imagined as a walled birch tree grove&quot; will double as an entrance to the theater, and be open during park hours even when the theater is not. This portion of the plan was designed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015736/http://www.mvvainc.com/category.php?c=parks">Michael Van Valkenberg Associates</a>, who have also worked on various sections of Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p>
