<p>That supercut of the best &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot; videos is going to have to be edited, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120609001440/http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2012/06/jimmy-carly-rae-jepsen-and-the-roots-play-call-me-maybe-with-classroom-instruments/">Jimmy Fallon</a> just threw his hat in the ring... and he brought the real deal Carly Rae Jepsen along. The singer performed with the late night host and his house band The Roots backstage before the show last night, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120609001440/http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2012/02/16/147016475/new-video-from-bon-iver-offer-stripped-down-versions-of-five-songs">like Bon Iver before her</a>, she went for a raw, stripped down sound. Jepsen plays the triangle, Fallon plays a wooden block, and the band filled it out with more advanced elementary instruments like the kazoo, washboard stick, tambourine, and recorder. Enjoy!</p>
