<p>Hasidic Jewish reggae performer Matisyahu <em>shaved his beard</em>, and announced this morning: &quot;No more Chassidic reggae superstar.&quot; The New York-raised artist, who grew up a Reconstructionist Jew, is best known for mixing traditional Jewish themes with reggae, and sometimes rock and hip hop. But with his new look (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602112129/https://twitter.com/#!/matisyahu/status/146577385318391808">he posted photos</a> of this morning along with his announcement), comes a new sound (though he&apos;s still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602112129/https://twitter.com/#!/matisyahu/status/146696803457310721">going to Shul</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602112129/http://matisyahuworld.com/news/detail/note_from_matisyahu/">His announcement</a> read:</p><blockquote>Sorry folks, all you get is me&#x2026; no alias. When I started becoming religious 10 years ago it was a very natural and organic process. It was my choice. My journey to discover my roots and explore Jewish spirituality&#x2014;not through books but through real life. At a certain point I felt the need to submit to a higher level of religiosity&#x2026;to move away from my intuition and to accept an ultimate truth. I felt that in order to become a good person I needed rules&#x2014;lots of them&#x2014;or else I would somehow fall apart. I am reclaiming myself. Trusting my goodness and my divine mission. Get ready for an amazing year filled with music of rebirth. And for those concerned with my naked face, don&#x2019;t worry&#x2026; you haven&#x2019;t seen the last of my facial hair</blockquote> Does this mean Matisyahu is going to start rocking Fabulous Fanny frames and come out with a chillwave album?<p></p>
