<p>This man was spotted on the L earlier this week, getting on at Grand Street and off at Union Square&#x2014;our tipster tells us: &quot;We asked if we could sit down. He ignored us and continued to read the paper and eat M&amp;Ms.; The train started to fill up towards Manhattan.&quot; As Arnold Diaz says, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174958/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/17123172/arnold-diaz">Shame Shame Shame</a>.&quot; Sure, the list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174958/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette rules</a> is a little long, but if you forget a few, just rely on common sense. Is it rush hour on the L train? Is there barely standing room for all of the people in your car? Then maybe don&apos;t sit in the middle of a two-seater bench, spread your legs open, fan out the NY Post as you dine on your morning M&amp;Ms;, and use your bike as your own personal velvet rope.</p>

<p>Almost exactly one year ago, we asked: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174958/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/26/subway_etiquette_when_is_it_okay_to.php">When is it okay to bring your bike on the subway</a>? There are some acceptable scenarios in which a cyclist can do this&#x2014;to recap: When it&apos;s snowing/raining, when the bike needs a repair, when you&apos;ve been injured, and when you&apos;re tripping face and the bike tells you it wants to ride on the subway. Even if none of the above apply, you can take your steed on the subway when it&apos;s not crowded... but just like those <em>without</em> bikes, please board with a modicum of decency. Or at least get creative and add a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174958/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/etiquette.php">comical banana peel</a> to your rule-breaking tableau.</p>
