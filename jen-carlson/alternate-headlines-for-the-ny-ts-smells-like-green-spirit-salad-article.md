<p>This weekend&apos;s New York Times magazine featured an article by the paper&apos;s former restaurant critic Sam Sifton, concerning a salad in Seattle&#x2014;the headline of the article: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720111419/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/magazine/smells-like-green-spirit.html?_r=0">Smells Like Green Spirit</a>.&quot; It&apos;s about the city&apos;s &quot;fanciest, finest restaurant&quot; of sixty years, where the unlikely highlight on the menu is a simple salad containing chopped romaine, bacon, croutons, cherry tomatoes, and a magic dressing made out of lemon and coddled eggs. Maybe if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720111419/http://gothamist.com/tags/kurtcobain">Kurt Cobain</a> had tasted it he would have never killed himself! Anyway, let&apos;s think of some alternate headlines:</p>

<ul><li>Ramp Me
</li><li>Swap Meat (With This Salad)
</li><li>About A Salad
</li><li>Where Did You Get That Salad Last Night
</li><li>Frances Farmer Will Have Her Salad In Seattle
</li><li>Lithi<em>yum</em>
</li><li>Floyd The Gardner
</li><li>On a Plain (of Greens)
</li><li>Territorial Mustard Greens
</li><li>Negative Beet
</li><li>(En)dive
</li><li>All Asparagus</li></ul>

<p>And this is only Nirvana&#x2014;feel free to think outside of the <em>heart shaped box</em> in the comments with Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Temple of the Dog, Hole, and 7 Year Bitch themed headlines.</p>
