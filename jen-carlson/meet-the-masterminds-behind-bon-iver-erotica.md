<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035355/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/26/men_are_reading_fifty_shades_of_gre.php">Last week</a> we were thrilled to happen up a new Tumblr called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035355/http://boniverotica.tumblr.com/">Bon Iver Erotica</a>, and quickly bookmarked it as we simultaneously threw away our copy of <em>Fifty Shades Of Grey</em>. Because <em>this</em> is our <em>Fifty Shades Of Grey</em> now. It&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035355/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/10/video_ryan_gosling.php">Hey Girl</a>&quot; meets the seclusion of northwestern Wisconsin and <em>it is perfect</em>. So naturally, we wanted to find out more about the project&#x2014;and while we were sad that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035355/http://gothamist.com/tags/boniver">Justin Vernon</a> himself wasn&apos;t sitting behind the curtain, the twenty-somethings who are running the show are doing a damn good job on their own. We caught up with them this week to find out more...</p>

<p><strong>Please tell us: who are you?</strong> We&apos;re a trio of very fun 20-somethings who live in Boulder, Colorado. </p>

<p><strong>How did Bon Iver Erotica (Bon IvErotica) start?</strong> Once we realized we all loved Bon Iver, we just began telling each other these little stories. We loved imagining ourselves in the rough hands of a capable lover, and that lover was Justin Vernon (in our simplified and silly imaginings, he is known as Bon Iver).</p>

<p><strong>Are you afraid you&apos;ll run out of material?</strong> If you a drop a penny down the well of Bon Iver&apos;s love, you&apos;ll never hear it hit bottom. He is an endless source of inspiration. </p>

<p><strong>Why is Bon Iver Erotica better than <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>?</strong> As you&apos;ve no doubt noticed, what we&apos;ve created is not really erotica. Rather, it&apos;s a series of vignettes that describe an utterly perfect romantic ideal (for some). We like to think that through Bon Iver we are sharing a message of selfless loving and appreciation of nature. But we are thankful for the success of Shades of Grey!</p>

<p><strong>Can you write a little NYC-centric Bon Iver Erotica bit for our readers on Gothamist?</strong> Bon Iver took me down to the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge and stared pensively across the water. &quot;These are the mountains that men build,&quot; he said, with a tinge of sadness in his voice. Then we made love behind a converted warehouse.</p>

<p><strong>Have you heard from an Bon Iver reps yet, or Justin himself?</strong> We haven&apos;t heard from Justin, but we like to think he chuckles throatily as he reads our little stories because we&apos;ve painted an idyllic picture. </p>
