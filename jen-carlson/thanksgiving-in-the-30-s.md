According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105132626/http://www.greenpt.com/anytngftkg.htm">this website</a>, kids would get dressed up and &quot;go from house to house yelling, &apos;Anything f&apos; Thanksgiv&apos;n?&apos; In return they would be rewarded with coins, or a piece of fruit, or a piece of candy. Apparently in those days it was called Ragamuffin Day and was practiced the day before Thanksgiving.&quot; <p></p>

<p>In this 1995 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105132626/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/l-memories-of-thanksgiving-begging-163895.html">NY Times letter</a> to the editor, one man explains, &quot;My brother and I were Thanksgiving &apos;ragamuffins&apos; in what is now called the Midwood section of Brooklyn &#x2014; we called it simply Flatbush then &#x2014; beginning in the early 1930&apos;s. We had it on excellent authority &#x2014; our parents&apos; &#x2014; that Thanksgiving begging dated to well before World War I. They had, in fact, participated themselves in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. Based upon our first-hand information, we believe the custom of Thanksgiving begging started no later than the beginning of the century, at least in Brooklyn, where most good things began anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105132626/http://web.wm.edu/amst/370/2005F/sp4/home_analysis_commercialization.htm?svr=www">this article</a>, &quot;Ragamuffin parades, which harkened back to European traditions, were a chance for the poorer immigrants of New York to march through the streets in extravagant costumes, begging for change. Popular myth would have us believe that the Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade originated in a similar fashion. Macy&apos;s itself supports the belief that its parade began as a spontaneous decision by immigrant store employees wishing to celebrate their newfound Americanness with a European-style parade.&quot; Of course, the idea <em>really</em> came from store executives.</p>
