(Many had expected the pick to be a female, due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025846/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/18/amy_poehler_will_leave_saturday_nig.php">Amy Poehler&apos;s departure</a>.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025846/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/20/bobby-moynihan-named-new_n_120114.html">The Huffington Post</a> reports that Moynihan worked on &quot;The Line,&quot; which has SNL cast members involved (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516025846/http://crackle.com/c/The_Line/The_Line_Ep_1_The_FutureSpace_Showdown_Begins/2340431#ml=o%3d12%26fpl%3d297691%26fx%3d">watch episodes here</a>), and with others from the SNL troupe at UCB.
