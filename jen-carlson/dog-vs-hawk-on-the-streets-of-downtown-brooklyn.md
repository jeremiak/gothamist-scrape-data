<p>This hawk was spotted hanging out near the Fulton Mall in Brooklyn over the weekend, and an eyewitness to the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003307/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/12/hawk-just-chilling-in-downtown-brooklyn/">told Animal</a> that it stayed there calmly for about ten minutes until a curious dog got too close for comfort. We contacted our hawk expert to find out if hawks chilling on city sidewalks like this is normal (usually they&apos;re just swooping down to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003307/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/19/hawk_bird_of_prey_seeks_meal_at_eas.php">steal our chicken</a>), and will update when we hear back. Until then, read an entertaining story about why Animal got the photos, and not the NY Post, who was gunning for them (hint: it pays to support the 99%).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003307/http://yojimbot.blogspot.com/">Yojimbot</a> tells us this behavior is &quot;not normal, but sometimes city hawks don&apos;t have a normal fear of people.  Often when they are acting listless or confused it&apos;s because they have a disease called frounce.&quot;</p>
