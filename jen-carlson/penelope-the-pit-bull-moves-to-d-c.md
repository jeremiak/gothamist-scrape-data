<p>A small update on the pit bull puppy that was discovered tied to the Williamsburg Bridge during a snowstorm last week... she&apos;s with her new family (in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161631/http://dcist.com/">D.C.</a>) and looks happy as can be. Her new humans named her Penelope, and Nick at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161631/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=3403">Scouting NY</a> (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161631/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/lets_save_this_cute_puppy_today.php">helped save</a> and deliver her to her new home) reports that &quot;when she arrived at her new home, she was timid at first, and even refused to go anywhere near the bed due to some sort of past training. They quickly broke her of this, and she spent the night cuddled up with them until late the next morning.&quot;</p>

<p>She lives with a husband, a wife, two pugs, and plenty of new toys. She&apos;s been to the vet, tested, treated, and soon-to-be microchipped. Her new family seems very happy with her... even if she snores.</p>
