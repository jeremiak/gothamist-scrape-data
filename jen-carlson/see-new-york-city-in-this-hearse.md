                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hearsetour.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914072706im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hearsetour.jpg" width="350" height="230" class="image-right"> </span>Well this is... dark. There&apos;s a new tour company in town and they want to show you the sites. You know, like where our 5th President James Monroe spent his final days, where artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring died, where Heath Ledger last lived, and where mobster &quot;Crazy Joe&quot; Gallo ate his last plate of pasta. Yep, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914072706/http://www.deadappletours.com/">Dead Apple Tour company</a> wants to show you the darker side of town, and they wanna do it in a 1960 Cadillac Superior Crown Royale hearse.</p>

<p>On your two-hour tour you&apos;ll also learn the dark secrets of iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building, discover the deadly secrets of &quot;The Hangman&#x2019;s Elm,&quot; hear the story of the Butcher of Tompkins Park <em>and</em> an 1849 riot involving actors from rival theaters in Astor Place. If you&apos;re left wanting more, one tour guide keeps up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914072706/http://twitter.com/deadappletours/">a Twitter</a> with &quot;death fun facts,&quot; like, &quot;More people are killed each year by coconuts than sharks. Approximately 150 people are killed each year by coconuts.&quot;</p>

<p>Tours cost 45 bucks a pop... so goth kids, start saving up your Hot Topic paychecks now&#x2014;it&apos;s probably better than your parents taking you to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914072706/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/18/addams_1.php">Addams Family</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130914072706/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/25/opinionist_american_idiot.php">American Idiot</a> double header on Broadway.</p>
