                            <p>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208080816/http://brandonbloch.com/">Brandon Bloch</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208080816/http://timsessler.com/">Tim Sessler</a> visited the most excessively tagged bathrooms in Brooklyn and created this, &quot;Dive Art: Brooklyn, NY,&quot; out of their journey into &quot;the sublime beauty of everyday spaces.&quot; Well, that is a very nice way of thinking about it. </p>

<p>The three minute short features bathrooms from bars in Bushwick, Greenpoint and Williamsburg (and was inspired by the Tumblr <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208080816/http://nyctoilets.tumblr.com/">Toilets of New York</a>), including  The Gutter, Duck Duck, Bushwick Country Club, Anchored Inn, and Pearl&apos;s Social. Bloch says, &quot;We were especially excited about how the graffiti looks when shot through a macro lens. The layers of color blend together on top of these old crumbling walls. It&apos;s really this organic beauty that&apos;s often dismissed as vandalism. But by reframing the subject, what emerges is art on par with what is sold in galleries.&quot; Ah, just think about what kind of things those layers contain...</p>
