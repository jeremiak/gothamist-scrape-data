We decided to ask him a few questions ourselves, and dig a little deeper - beyond the beard (just a little though). </p>

<p><strong>How did NY Mag approach you for the Look Book piece?</strong><br>
They found me walking past Times Square.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think they picked you?</strong><br>
I have crazy facial hair.</p>

<p><strong>Where did they shoot the photo?</strong><br>
They shot the photo around the corner from the main subway entrance at Times Square...on a side street outside. They had set up roll paper and two soft boxes. There were a few photo assistants and a photographer.</p>

<p><strong>They focus on your facial hair in the first question, would you ever consider growing a neck beard? (Interesting neck beard story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103812/http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/6889#139018">here</a> - the comment beginning with &quot;My friend Andrew...&quot;).</strong><br>
In general, i  believe neck hair to be grosser and more uncomfortable than other facial hair. The article you sited partially referenced that.  As far as facial hair and attractiblilty goes...here&apos;s my take ... i don&apos;t think people are specifically into in a facial hair cut like mine, but they might think, &apos;wow, that&apos;s...weird...maybe they&apos;re interesting or witty or something.&apos;</p>

<p><strong>What is the Accumulation Project all about?</strong><br>
The Accumulation Project is an idea a few of my friends and myself came up with. Basicallly, we thought it would be interesting and challenging to curate a year-long group art show where individuals would gather one kind of thing for year and do something interesting with it. We have a website, and every month each accumulator (artist) would send photo/text/audio/video documentation updates on their accumulates and how their accumulation was changing/growing. We had a &apos;teaser&apos; show last year and are looking for a space to host our second show reflecting the changed/similarites to the first show, and to see how each project has changed.<br>
The website is here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103812/http://www.accumulationproject.org/">www.accumulationproject.org</a></p>

<p><strong>Anything you&apos;d like to say about your style, or anything else for that matter, that you didn&apos;t get to say in the NY Mag piece?</strong><br>
As far as style, the only thing I&apos;d like to say is that witty and eccentric should be cool. As far as other stuff goes... a few weeks ago, NY Mag featured a story about Jersey City. In my interview with them, i mentioned that most of the interviewees were young and white. Jersey City is incredibly culturally diverse. Did they talk to them? And my term &apos;Williamsburgising&apos; [sp?] may have been slightly inaccurate, or at least misunderstood in my mind. I meant to say that Jersey City is experiencing rapid and uncreative urban development (gentrification? Williamsburgization?) in the form of newly constructed condos, luxury condos, and condos. I don&apos;t see much of anything that is being built that is affordable to the average current Jersey City resident. It seems all aimed at higher-incomed people who as of yet don&apos;t live there. Is this the future of urban planning? Is this sustainable?</p>

<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103812/http://www.111first.org/home.cfm">111 1st Street</a> still stood. It was a huge warehouse kind of building with hundreds of working artists in it.  There seemed semi-utopic popssibilities for the future of Jersey City with 111 and a strong art/cultural scene at it&apos;s heart--an artist-rich downtown area with functional and educational studios, galleries, shops, theatres....who knows. The owner of the building, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103812/http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=SUf&amp;q=%22lloyd+goldman%22+jersey+city&amp;btnG=Search">Lloyd Goldman eveicted the artists</a> and is in the process of building...you guessed it....luxury condos.</p>

<p>I also wanted NY Mag to mention this book I helped put together that is a moving collection of photos of the hand-made signs that appeared in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It is a fund raiser for  some Gulf Coast area volunteer organizations...It&apos;s called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103812/http://www.signsoflifebook.com/">Signs of Life: Surviving Katrina</a>.</p>
