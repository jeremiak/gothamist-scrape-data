Driving around Pasadena one day&#x2014;which is essentially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145112/http://hometown-pasadena.com/resident-tourist/hollywood-east-movie-and-tv-locations">one large filming location</a>&#x2014;I swung by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145112/http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2009/06/22/don-drapers-house-from-mad-men/">the home</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145112/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>&apos;s Betty and Don Draper.

<p>The colonial home&#x2014;which on the show was in Ossining, NY&#x2014;is located at 675 Arden Road, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145112/https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=675+Arden+Road,+Pasadena,+CA&amp;daddr=843+S+El+Molino+Ave,+Pasadena,+CA+91106&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=34.131622,-118.136558&amp;sspn=0.000757,0.000704&amp;geocode=FTLQCAId1mH1-Cl5LiNmn8TCgDGCvLOsIAiu7Q%3BFa_NCAIdGF_1-CmH9ZVAn8TCgDEcK7Zi7UIaBw&amp;oq=675+Arden+Road&amp;t=h&amp;gl=us&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ltm&amp;z=20">about 300 feet</a> from the <em>Father Of The Bride</em> house, an oddly New England looking area in the shadow of hills and palm trees.</p>
