</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> seems to be &quot;LA LA LA I can&apos;t hear you&quot;-ing her way out of her latest scandal&#x2014;in which she may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/gaga_7.php">stolen her identity</a> from a now-deceased musician she co-wrote songs with. Everything seemed like business-as-usual last night at the VMAs, but the pop star shut down her fan message board following the aforementioned scandal breaking, in what seems like an effort to place a gag order on her monster minions and anyone else she has power over. Anyway, it&apos;s nothing a little <em>meat dress</em> won&apos;t distract from! </p>

<p>While the performer showed up in a dress fit for pop royalty last night, said to be from late designer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/cfda_gala.php">Alexander McQueen</a>&apos;s last collection, she quickly changed into an outfit made entirely of meat. The dress was designed by Franc Fernandez, and as you might imagine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2010/09/lady_gaga_meat_dress.php">PETA</a> had something to say on the topic. The organization told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://www.tmz.com/person/lady-gaga/">TMZ</a>, <strong>&quot;After time spent under the TV lights, it would smell like the rotting flesh that it is and likely be crawling in maggots.&quot;</strong> Maybe that&apos;s why Cher seemed apprehensive about holding her meat purse when she delivered Gaga one of her eight awards last night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a biography on the poster girl for carnivore couture is set to his shelves soon, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gaga_grab_for_glory_HnM5UCKsU1AE1uPvPj0UAI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> has an excerpt. No word on if her maybe-muse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://gothamist.com/tags/linamorgana">Lina Morgana</a> is mentioned, but we do learn such <em>fascinating</em> things like how Gaga (then Stefani Germanotta) &quot;would spend her days composing and demo-ing in her apartment; her place was sparsely furnished with a futon, a queen-sized mattress and a record player from Urban Outfitters... [and] a picture of David Bowie over her bed.&quot; Her apartment, by the way, was at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424105013/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=176+Stanton+St+ny&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=176+Stanton+St,+New+York,+10002&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=3yqOTMOpM4H58Aajif31CQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=40.720917,-73.984036&amp;spn=0.008326,0.017295&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.720101,-73.984042&amp;panoid=1MdAU1Z-2ENpeFmHrwwmLQ&amp;cbp=12,39.5,,0,-17.29">176 Stanton Street</a> on the Lower East Side, where one resident&apos;s sister once mistook her for a prostitute!</p>
