										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpW4YcxLPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150040im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpW4YcxLPM.jpg" width="300" height="275" class="image-left"> </span>In honor of the New York Historical Society&apos;s upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150040/https://www.nyhistory.org/web/default.php?section=exhibits_collections&amp;page=exhibit_detail&amp;id=5798416">Grateful Dead exhibition</a>, the Empire State Building is going to be <em>tie dye</em> tomorrow. At press time, we were unable to confirm how in the world this was going to happen, short of dosing the entire city with acid and hoping everyone sees beautiful melting colors shining off the building. </p>

<p>No word on if members of the Dead will be on hand for the lighting tomorrow, but the press release stated that Phil Lesh and Bob Weir will be guests of honor at the fundraising reception, which takes place on Wednesday (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150040/http://www.nyhistory.org/web/dead_tickets">tickets</a>). The exhibit will open in March 2010, and promises to be <em>epic</em>; drawn almost exclusively from the Grateful Dead Archive, it will chronicle the history of the band, their music, &quot;and phenomenal longevity through an array of original art and documents related to the band, its members, performances, and productions. Exhibition highlights from the archive will include concert and recording posters, album art, large-scale marionettes and other stage props, banners, and vast stores of decorated fan mail.&quot;</p>

<p>If you capture the building draped in tie-dye, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150040/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us your pics</a>!</p>
