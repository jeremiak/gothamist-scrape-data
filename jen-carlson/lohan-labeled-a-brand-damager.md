<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="LOHANFASHIONWEEK.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811100813im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/LOHANFASHIONWEEK.jpg" width="125" height="112" class="image-right"> </span>Last year when Ashley Dupre was seated in the front of of Yigal Azrouel&apos;s Fashion Week show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811100813/http://www.bravotv.com/kell-on-earth">people got fired</a>. This year, Lindsay Lohan is the new Dupre, and designer Jill Stuart has deemed her a &quot;brand damager&quot; (though she denies banning the fallen actress from her show). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811100813/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/fashion/shows/05lohan.html">Maybe this</a> had something to do with it? Apparently that isn&apos;t the only reason La Lohan isn&apos;t in town for the events, either; one source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811100813/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/02/16/2010-02-16_brand_damager_lindsay_lohan_reportedly_not_invited_to_designer_jill_stuarts_fash.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;Fashion Week kind of belongs to the Ronsons... and Charlotte had Lindsay banned from both her show and after-party&#x2014;just like she did this past fall.&quot; Lohan has had a dramatic on-again/off-again relationship with Charlotte&apos;s sister Samantha. Aw, seems like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811100813/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/07/fashion_week_has_begun_lohan_causes.php">just yesterday</a> they were laughing it up in the front row.</p>
