<p>The people behind this stunning timelapse call it a &quot;mixtape&quot; made up of 321 different shots taken over a two week period of time. The 3.5 minute piece was made for the 2013 US Open broadcast on ESPN, and the team recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112551/http://www.kessleru.com/2013/09/working-with-tight-deadlines-a-conversation-with-the-seventh-movement/">discussed the shoot</a>, their process, and navigating New York with their crew:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The vision for the shoot came down to the word Grand. Everything had to be big and wide. Showcasing the enormity of NYC; the biggest, brightest backdrop for the 2013 US Open. So with that in mind, think big for every shot. 

<p>When the weather is right, aim up and get those big clouds rolling over the city. When the clouds aren&#x2019;t running, aim down and turn your attention to other moving elements. People and cars. Shadows creeping.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>And as for shooting around the city: &quot;Sometimes we don&#x2019;t ask at all and just get our stealth on. In situations like the subway or Grand Central, it is better to ask for forgiveness afterwards.&quot; Check it out below, but as always with timelapses, you may want to pipe in your own music.</p>
