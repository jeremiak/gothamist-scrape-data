					<p>Brooklyn Heights is filled with charming old homes&#x2014;it is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227055536/https://www.amazon.com/Brooklyn-Heights-Rebirth-Americas-Definitive/dp/162619954X/">America&apos;s First Suburb</a>, after all&#x2014;but one of the most unique and treasured of them all is the clapboard house at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227055536/https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7006665,-73.9942555,3a,89.5y,118.97h,96.53t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1ungwriM6L6xgPohEQihbg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1">24 Middagh Street</a>. The 19th century abode&#x2014;which has been in the same family since the 1950s&#x2014;sits on the corner of Willow Street, and just a block from the best view of the Manhattan Skyline. The house is more like a compound, featuring the main house <em>and</em> a carriage house (the two are joined by a private courtyard), and it&apos;s now on the market for $6,650,000 (down from $7 million, which it listed for when it went on the market late last year). The rare opportunity to own the oldest house in Brooklyn Heights means that anyone can get a look inside, finally.</p>

<p>The sellers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227055536/http://www.24middagh.com/">set up a website</a> for the sale, featuring photos of the interior of the home, and a little bit of its history:</p><blockquote>The oldest house in Brooklyn Heights, 24 Middagh Street, known as the &quot;Boisselet house,&quot; can be dated to the early 19th century; some archivists surmise that it dates to 1790 and moved from near the Fulton Ferry Landing. Its Federal-style clapboard structure and charm remain intact, and its doorway alone, with elegant top- and sidelights and period bootscrapers are notable examples of the form.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The main house spans four floors and features a kitchen, dining room, and five bedrooms, while the carriage house has a living and dining area, two bedrooms, and a wood burning fire place. Seems like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227055536/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/hygge_guide.php">a good place to hygge out</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227055536/https://www.6sqft.com/oldest-home-in-brooklyn-heights-hits-the-market-for-6-65m/">According to 6sqft</a>, the current owners are Celeste Weisman and her brother Jared, who grew up in the house but have been renting it out. Their parents bought the home in 1958.</p>
