<p>Senator Chuck Schumer is not actually a hip hop or rap or any type of music expert, even if he has been spotted hangin&apos; with Jay-Z and Beyonce in the past. <em>In Williamsburg</em>, no less. <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000336/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/31/the_grizz.php">At a Grizzly Bear concert</a></em>. Still, he is a politician, so we&apos;re guessing he probably doesn&apos;t even know what Chillwave is, even if he&apos;s riding his bike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000336/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/schumer_wont_comment_on_bike_lanes.php">all over Brooklyn</a>. So the fact that he mixed up L.L. Cool J and DJ Kool Herc is really not very surprising. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000336/http://www.politicker.com/2012/02/20/chuck-schumer-needs-to-brush-up-on-his-hip-hop-history/">Politicker</a>, over the weekend Schumer was speaking at a gala scholarship dinner at the annual New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus association weekend, when the subject of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000336/http://gothamist.com/tags/1520sedgwick">1520 Sedgwick</a> came up. </p>

<p>The building in the Bronx is thought of as the &quot;birthplace of hip hop,&quot; to many, because it was there that Kool Herc first mixed records and introduced extended break beats. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000336/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/03/birthplace_of_h.php">In 2008</a>, Schumer began lobbying on behalf of the tenants to preserve the building&apos;s affordability. When addressing those efforts this weekend, he told the crowd, &#x201C;I have kept my promises to you that, while I have clout in Washington, I will do everything I can for our dear State of New York. So, <strong>when greedy landlords in the Bronx wanted to close the home on Sedgwick Avenue where L.L. Kool Herc invented hip hop</strong> and lots of hardworking people lived, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000336/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/birthplace-hip-hop-bronx-landlord-battle-building-affordable-article-1.976259">we stopped them</a>.&quot; Maybe Kool Herc can mix up some old Cool J jams? <em>Maybe Schumer is on to something here?</em> Or maybe in the future Schumer will be able to separate the two by remembering that LL Cool J <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000336/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_Cool_J#Personal_life"><em>is a Republican</em></a>.
