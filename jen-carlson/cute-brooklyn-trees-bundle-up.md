<p>If you&apos;re an object without a knit, well, you are doing it wrong. Seriously, what <em>isn&apos;t</em> getting knit these days? Back in 2009 the crafty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191334/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/knitta_please_hits_montague_street.php">Knitta Please</a> crew adorned parking meters in Brooklyn Heights with some colorful custom pieces, then Olek raised the bar with some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191334/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/10/knitta.php">knit bikes</a>, and more recently outdid herself by creating a custom knit for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191334/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/27/spotted_wall_street_bull_warms_up_w.php">Wall Street bull</a>.

Dream catchers? [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405191334/http://imby.blogspot.com/2011/01/tree-sweater-weather.html">IMBY</a>]</p>
