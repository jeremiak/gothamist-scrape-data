<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="chuckhouse1113.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132505im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/chuckhouse1113.jpeg" width="300" height="281"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> As you can see from the logo, Chuck is also a helpless Time Warner Customer.</i></div> If you&apos;re awake before the sun rises this Saturday, consider going to Staten Island to see the final meeting between Mayor Bloomberg and Charles G. Hogg (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132505/http://gothamist.com/tags/statenislandchuck">Chuck</a>), as the groundhog tells us if we&apos;re in for more winter or an early spring.<p></p>

<p>Back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132505/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/02/staten_island_chuck_predicts_spring.php">2009</a> the four-legged weather predictor bit Bloomberg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132505/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/04/staten_island_chuck_a_rodent_star_i.php">turning him into a star</a>, but since then the two have been amicable. However, that is not stopping us from calling Saturday&apos;s event <em>Staten Island Chuck Vs. Bloomberg: FINAL BLOOD</em> (at press time poster art is awaiting final approval).</p>

<p>So you want to be at this once-in-a-lifetime event, right? Admission to the ceremony, which begins around 6:30 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132505/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151219310366640&amp;set=a.383826306639.169191.27619211639&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1">at the Staten Island Zoo</a>, is free. But if you want to dine with Chuck afterwards, there&apos;s a &quot;Breakfast with Chuck&quot; option that will cost $10 for adults and $5 for children (call 718-442-3101, ext. 14 for reservations).</p>
