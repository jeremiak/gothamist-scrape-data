<p>Earlier this afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107091135/https://twitter.com/#!/maxsilvestri/status/197774115824877568">Max Silvestri Tweeted</a>, &quot;Which PopChips Ashton Kutcher character is your fave? It&apos;s so hard to pick! (how I&apos;m gonna drown myself fastest),&quot; with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107091135/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4PZ6_9kPgQ&amp;feature=autoplay&amp;list=PL9A9C3E142391E04E&amp;playnext=1">a link</a> that sent us into a world where Kutcher portrays a diva; a hippie; a biker; and Raj, an Indian. Soon after, New York band Das Racist&#x2014;who are 2/3 Indian&#x2014;also noted the ad campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107091135/https://twitter.com/#!/dasracist/status/197770864706600961">on Twitter</a>, calling Kutcher out for playing a &quot;brownface character.&quot;</p>

<p>Anil Dash is also questioning how this ad campaign got approved, via Twitter, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107091135/http://dashes.com/anil/2012/05/fixing-popchips.html">in a longer form</a> piece on his blog.<br>

<p>Kutcher, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107091135/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/many-faces-of-aston-kutcher-in-popchips-ad-campaign/">helped develop the campaign</a>, hasn&apos;t responded as of yet, but we reached out to PopChips, who told us: </p>

<blockquote>The new popchips worldwide dating video and ad campaign featuring four characters was created to provoke a few laughs and was never intended to stereotype or offend anyone. <strong>At popchips we embrace all types of shapes, flavors and colors, and appreciate all snackers</strong>, no matter their race or ethnicity. We hope people can enjoy this in the spirit it was intended.</blockquote>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Sometime between 6:30 and 8 p.m. the video went private... but the agency is still hosting them on their Vimeo, which you can see below.</p>
