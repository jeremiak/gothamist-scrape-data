<p>Radiohead&apos;s video for &quot;Daydreaming,&quot; directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is getting the big screen treatment this week. Metrograph, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801211132/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/metrograph_movie_theater.php">the delightful little indie theater</a> that recently opened on Ludlow Street in Manhattan, will be screening the video in 35mm before all films, all week long.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801211132/https://twitter.com/MetrographNYC/status/729325950832365572">The theater tweeted</a> the above photo of the film&apos;s canister earlier this week, which shows a note that reads: &quot;We&apos;ve made a film, here it is. We&apos;d be happy if you played it!&quot; The run time is 7 minutes. The Alamo Drafthouse also got their hands on it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801211132/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/08/radiohead-daydreaming-video-theaters">along with other theaters</a> nationwide.</p>
