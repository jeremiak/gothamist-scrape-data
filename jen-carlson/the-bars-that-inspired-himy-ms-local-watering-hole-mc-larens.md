<p>On Monday night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/14/how_i_met_your_mother_1.php"><em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a> returned for its final season after 8 years on the air. The crew is going to be mostly on Long Island this season, which will span the 56 hours before Barney and Robin&#x2019;s wedding. Which is sort of a shame, because even though the show doesn&apos;t actually film in New York, they&apos;ve always done the city right. More right than many other shows that actually <em>do</em> film here. The creators really get New York and New Yorkers&#x2014;and this is apparent in even the simple details. For instance, the characters on the show <em>actually take the subway</em>, and they even frequent a bar (you very rarely saw the <em>Friends</em> or <em>Seinfeld</em> cast in a bar). But does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/MacLaren&apos;s_Pub">their local watering hole</a> exist in real life NYC? Sort of. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://www.jimcolucci.com/files/CBS_Watch_Apr_08_How_They_Created_Mother.pdf">a 2008 interview</a>, CBS&apos;s Watch magazine talked to creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas and found out the origins of McLaren&apos;s bar:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;McLaren&apos;s doesn&apos;t actually exist in Manhattan&#x2014;the TV watering hole and its bartender are named for Carl, a <em>Mother</em> associate producer&#x2014;but is instead a composite of four real favorite hangouts of the Bays, Thomas and friends from the <em>Letterman</em> staff. <strong>McGee&apos;s</strong>, a tavern around the corner from Letterman&apos;s Ed Sullivan Theater, features the model for Maclaren&apos;s WPA-era mural on its brick wall. The recently closed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://www.yelp.com/biz/mchales-new-york"><strong>McHale&apos;s</strong></a> on Eight Avenue, where Bays and Thomas first started writing jokes during their MTV summer, lent its dark atmosphere. 

<p>A Greenwich Village speakeasy named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://gothamist.com/tags/chumley&apos;s"><strong>Chumley&apos;s</strong></a>, where Thomas typed away on the pilot script, inspired some of Maclaren&apos;s more rustic touches. And at <strong>Fez</strong>, a recently shuttered Moroccan-style bar on the Upper West Side. Bays and Thomas befriended the DJ, Josh Mosby, who later gave Ted his surname. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://www.yelp.com/biz/fez-under-time-cafe-new-york">Fez</a> gave the writers the idea to put a few round booths at the back of their TV bar.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The only one of those left now is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcgees-new-york">McGee&apos;s</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://mcgeespub.com/menu.html">menu</a>), so head to 240 W 55th Street (between Broadway and 8th Avenue) if you want to&#x2014;order a Scherbatsky:</p>

<p>But where&apos;s that Canadian bar?</p>

<p>UPDATE: A commenter points out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141933/http://www.yelp.com/biz/mchales-bar-and-grill-new-york">McHale&apos;s is technically open</a>, but not in the same location, and not by the same owners, so it doesn&apos;t really count!
