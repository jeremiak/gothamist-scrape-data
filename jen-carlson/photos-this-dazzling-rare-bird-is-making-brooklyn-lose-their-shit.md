<p>Prospect Park is drawing enthusiastic birdwatchers hoping to catch a glimpse of a painted bunting, a bird not typically found in these parts. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063857/http://nypost.com/2015/12/02/people-are-losing-their-s-t-over-this-bird/">the NY Post</a>, the winged visitor has been hanging around the LeFrak Center, where &quot;at least 100 avian enthusiasts a day are showing up.&quot; Though according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063857/http://birding.aba.org/mobiledigest/NY01#1032812">some birding message boards</a>, there were only 3 people there yesterday. </p>

<p>One birder told the paper, &quot;people are losing their shit over this bird.&quot; Why? Because it&apos;s pretty, and a rare sighting here.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This is the first adult male painted bunting that&#x2019;s ever had a recorded visit to Brooklyn &#x2014; and one of only 10 birds of his species to have arrived since 1927, according to data compiled by the New York State Area Records Committee.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Birder Paul Chung, who took the above photo, doesn&apos;t think it will be around for much longer&#x2014;he told us the bird, originally spotted by Brooklyn birder&#x200E; Keir Randall, &quot;is a resident of Florida and Texas and winters in Mexico. Rarely seen in New York.&quot; </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063857/http://birding.aba.org/mobiledigest/NY01#1032970">this thread</a>, as of this morning the painted bunting is still &quot;in the plantings on top of the LeFrak Skating Rink,&quot; possibly hanging out with 7 European Goldfinches.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063857/http://research.amnh.org/vz/ornithology/staff/paul-sweet">Paul Sweet</a>, Ornithologist at the American Museum of Natural History, told us more about the bird:</p><blockquote>The Painted Bunting breeds in summer along the Atlantic seaboard from North Carolina  south to northern Florida  with a second population found in south central USA. These birds would normally migrate in the fall to south Florida, the Caribbean and Mexico but every year a few make a wrong turn and head north, a phenomenon known as vagrancy. It&#x2019;s these stray birds that get birders excited, the last time a Painted Bunting was seen in Brooklyn was in March of 1999 and that was a drab female not the multicolored male that is being seen in Prospect Park.</blockquote><p></p>
