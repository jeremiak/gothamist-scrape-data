<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305123355/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/08/gowanus_wall.php">Earlier this year</a> an investigation of sorts was underway, as the Landmark Preservation Commission tried to determine whether a wall in Gowanus was worthy of landmark designation. Some believe the  20-foot wall&#x2014;which stands at 3rd Avenue between 1st and 3rd Streets&#x2014;is part of the original Dodgers stadium (aka Washington Park stadium). As of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305123355/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/31/gowanus_wall_not_really_part_of_ori.php">last December</a> Con Ed was slated to demo some buildings by the wall, but said they would preserve the wall itself. But today April from Brooklyn sent us the above photo and noted, &quot;the last remaining section of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305123355/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/Dodgers/dodgers.html">oldest baseball stadium</a> in Brooklyn (now part of a Con Ed facility in Gowanus) seems to be coming down.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the company to see <em>what gives</em>, and will update if/when we hear back.</p>
