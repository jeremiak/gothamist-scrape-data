title: Doors Close at CBGB
---

	
										<p>Last night was the final one at CBGB, the (now even more) legendary venue shut it&apos;s doors for good sometime after 1am. For a ton of coverage on the last couple of nights there, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033522/http://brooklynvegan.com/">Brooklyn Vegan</a>. Bad Brains was one of the last bands to take the stage, a short video of that is below, and we expect a lot more video (of the last nights with Patti Smith, Debbie Harry, et al) will be showing up as the day goes on. <br>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033522/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hell">Richard Hell</a> (ex-Television) told the NY Times that &#x201C;CBGB&#x2019;s is going to be dismantled and reconstructed as an exhibit in Las Vegas, like Elvis. I like that. A lot. I really hope it happens as intended.&#x201D; Television&apos;s performances at CBGB helped start punk and inspired artists like Patti Smith (who actually wrote the first press review of the band for the Soho Weekly News in 1974). </p>

<p>Love the club or hate it, it&apos;s a part of the history of this city, and it&apos;s sort of a shame they aren&apos;t going to reconstruct the stage in another location here. </p>

<p>Update: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033522/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35om3fNqcZk">Here&apos;s a clip</a> of Debbie Harry singing &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; at CBGB. And they have already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033522/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/10/cbgb_the_mornin.html">taken the awning down</a>!</p>
