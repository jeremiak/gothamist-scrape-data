										<p>So what happens to NBC&apos;s late night shows when Conan replaces Leno in two years? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180621/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/22/arts/television/22cona.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin">The Times reports</a> that, &quot;One move is expected to involve signing Jimmy Fallon, a former star of NBC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Saturday Night Live,&#x201D; to what is known as a holding deal. It would bring him back to the network and put him in position to be a prime contender for Mr. O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s job as host of NBC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Late Night&#x201D; show, at 12:35 a.m.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, you probably hate Jimmy Fallon, but let&apos;s consider the alternative for a minute, The Times goes on to say that Mr. TRL himself is also asking to be considered. Carson Daly...Jimmy Fallon...Carson Daly...Jimmy Fallon. We&apos;ll take Jimmy any day. </p>

<p>In the early 1980s David Letterman signed a holding deal with NBC and by 1982 took his spot in late-night programming, so it seems like Fallon is following those footsteps. We hope it resembles &quot;The Barry Gibb Show&quot; (see below):<br>
