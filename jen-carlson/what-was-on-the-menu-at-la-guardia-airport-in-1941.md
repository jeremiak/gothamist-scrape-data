</div></div>					<p>Before Au Bon Pain and other chains took over LaGuardia Airport, there was the Airport Coffee Shop. This old menu, from 1941&#x2014;about two years after the airport opened&#x2014;was uploaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161747/http://menus.nypl.org/menus/30491&quot;">by the NYPL</a>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161747/https://twitter.com/nypl_menus/status/260806118232686594">pointed out</a> the Peanut Butter &amp; Bacon sandwich today. That offering went for .15 cents (the same amount as a regular PB&amp;J;!), and while you can probably still find something like that on menus today, there are some other things you probably wouldn&apos;t be able to&#x2014;like, say, the diced tongue omelette (.85 cents) or the fried ham/egg/relish sandwich (.30 cents).</p>
