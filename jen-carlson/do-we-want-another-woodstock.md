<p>On the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619232733/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodstock">of August 15th in 1969</a>, an event occurred that could never occur in the same way again. <em>As it should be</em>. And yet there have been a couple of attempts at recreating the magic of the original Woodstock festival. This has gone about as well as it has gone when someone attempts to bring a loved one back from the dead through zombie magic. Or cloning. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619232733/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_1999#Violence">Limp Bizkit. Rape. Fire.</a> These have been just three outcomes from recreating Woodstock in the past.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Trent Reznor covered in mud <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619232733/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/nine_inch_nails_returns_revisit_the.php">was excellent</a>.</p>

<p>And on the invisible hand, do you remember &quot;The Forgotten Woodstock&quot;? Of course you don&apos;t, or else that wouldn&apos;t be its nickname. It took place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619232733/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_%2789">in 1989</a>.</p>

<p>The newest incarnation of the festival would be in 2019, for the 50th anniversary. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619232733/http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/entertainment/2016/02/10/woodstock-50th-anniversary-concert-works/80195364/">the Poughkeepsie Journal</a>, &quot;Ulster County resident Michael Lang, the driving force behind the famous festival that attracted hundreds of thousands to Sullivan County in August 1969&quot; is planning a comeback. But will it come back to Bethel, NY? That&apos;s up in the air.</p>

<blockquote>Lang told the Journal that discussions are under way with potential partners and different locations are being explored. An overseas event, in addition to one being planned for the U.S., is possible. Details on potential locations and possible performers were not available.</blockquote>

<p>Lang also wants to bring Woodstock further into the future with an annual festival&#x2014;he says it is &quot;the original and most famous festival brand. With the prevalence of festivals out there, and all the excitement about them, maybe it&#x2019;s time for that [an annual concert driven by the Woodstock name].&quot;</p>
