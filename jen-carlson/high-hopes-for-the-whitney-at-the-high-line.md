An agreement between the museum and the city has been three years in the making, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150318/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/arts/design/12museum.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> reports that they&apos;re forging ahead with plans to open a Renzo Piano-designed space at the entrance of the High Line; it will be six stories high and twice the size of their current location.</p>

<p>They have now signed a contract with the city&apos;s Economic Development Corporation &quot;to buy the city-owned site at Washington and Gansevoort Streets for $18 million. That is about half the appraised value of the property, a sign of the city&#x2019;s interest in drawing visitors to the area.&quot; They now have four years to close on the purchase of the land, and five to start bringing the design to life. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150318/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/19/whitney_museum_1.php">Last year</a> Leonard A. Lauder donated $131 million to the museum, under the condition that they do not sell their first home, the 1966 Marcel Breuer building on Madison Avenue and 75th Street. The Whitney&apos;s director, Adam Weinberg, says &quot;the money for the project would come from capital funds, not the operating budget.&quot; They will also eventually sell five town houses next to the Breuer building in order to make the downtown museum a reality. Perhaps once they settle in on the High Line, they&apos;ll team up with the Standard for an ongoing, ever-changing exhibit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150318/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/26/exhibitionists_are_standard_at_hote.php">of the human form</a>.</p>
