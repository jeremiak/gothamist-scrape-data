<p>Andy Warhol&apos;s portrait of Elvis Presley as a cowboy is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001435/http://news.yahoo.com/warhol-portrait-elvis-could-fetch-50m-nyc-172514820.html">headed to the auction block</a> in Manhattan on May 9th, y&apos;all. The &quot;Double Elvis (Ferus Type)&quot; silkscreen is the first to appear on the market since 1995, and is expected to go for up to $50 million at Sotheby&apos;s.</p>

<p>The silkscreen was made in 1963, and is part of a series of 22 that Warhol did of the musician (currently 9 are in museum collections). They were for an exhibition at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, where they were on display with his Elizabeth Taylor prints. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001435/http://www.warholstars.org/chron/1963.html">the Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonn&#xE9;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Warhol made two types of compositions based on the same picture of Elvis Presley. The source has not been located but a comparable image has been identified in the Warhol archive&#x2014;a colour postcard, printed in Germany, that shows Presley as a gunslinger... On the back, the movie is identified as <em>Flaming Star</em>, a Western directed by Don Siegel... The postcard documents Warhol&apos;s source and helps to establish a date before July 1963 for the paintings.</blockquote>
