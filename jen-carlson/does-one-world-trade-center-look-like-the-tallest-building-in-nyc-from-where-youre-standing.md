<p>From 1931 to 1972, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in New York City&#x2014;a title it regained after the tragedy on September 11th, 2001. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105507/http://www.metro.us/newyork/local/article/1141230--one-world-trade-center-almost-new-york-city-s-tallest-building">Metro</a> is reporting today that One World Trade Center will grow to be the tallest building in New York by Monday, it already took that title back in March, as we noted while wondering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105507/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/is_the_freedom_tower_going_to_be_to.php#photo-1">if the building looked too small</a>. There seems to be some confusion about whether they&apos;re counting the floors or the outside of the structure, but at any rate, it is or will be the tallest! Earlier this month it was just four feet below the Empire State Building&apos;s 1,250-feet, and once finished it will be 1,368 feet high.</p>

<p>So, we want to know what it looks like from where you&apos;re standing&#x2014;too small, too big, just right? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105507/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">Send us</a> your photos or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr or hashtag them #Gothamist on Instagram, and don&apos;t forget to tell us where the photo was taken from.</p>
