<p>This just in: Gothamist fave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519165032/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/09/suzanne_vega.php">Suzanne Vega</a> will be hosting a last-minute event at the Russian Tea Room tonight, and if you have $88, you&apos;re invited! They tell us:</p>

<blockquote>Suzanne Vega is hosting a reading at The Russian Tea Room tonight at 7 p.m. Vega is a masterful storyteller who got her start singing at Greenwich Village clubs before propelling to the top of the folk music charts with the release of her self titled debut album in 1985. She is known for her introspective lyrics about city life.</blockquote>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the publicity team to find out if Ms. Vega will be performing as well, and they told us, &quot;Not sure. She is doing a reading&#x2014;she may perform impromptu but that is not planned.&quot; We&apos;re guessing this lady doesn&apos;t travel without her guitar, so our money is on her playing a couple tunes as well... especially for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519165032/http://www.runmyclub.com/hudson/eventcalendar.asp?id=206561">an $88 ticket</a>.</p>
