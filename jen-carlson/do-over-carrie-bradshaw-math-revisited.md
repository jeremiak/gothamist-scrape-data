										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="bradshawmath06311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427174217im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bradshawmath06311.jpg" width="350" height="340"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">So much money is being spent in this photo alone!</span></i></div> Last month a site called The Frenemy tackled &quot;Carrie Bradshaw Math,&quot; which was essentially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427174217/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/young_writer_who_moved_to_nyc_finds.php">the author throwing a lexical tantrum</a> after feeling duped into moving to New York City under the assumption that she could live like a fictional television character. Raise your hand if you ever felt like <em>Sex and the City</em> was a good blueprint of which to base your real life. No one is raising their hand (we have a new technology that we won&apos;t get in to right now, <em>there&apos;s just no time</em>). <p></p>

<p>So now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427174217/http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/carrie-bradshaws-budget-in-real-numbers/">another lad</a>y is tackling Carrie Bradshaw&apos;s finances and budget, saying she &quot;felt unfulfilled when a trillion dollars was allocated to condoms.&quot; In other words, the math on the site was inaccurate, just as life portrayed on a television show is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Okay, ready for some math fun? Season 1 of the show took place in 1998, and our latest Carrie fan/math wizard notes that &quot;considering Inflation, what cost .75 cents at the start of the series now costs us $1.&quot; And here&apos;s what she presumes Carrie&apos;s budget was, while making $1,500/month:<br>
</p><ul><li>2-3 packs of cigarettes a week: $49/month ($3.50 a pack!)<br>
</li><li>Expensive cocktails: $33/week or $132/month<br>
</li><li>Brunch: $121/month<br>
</li><li>Designer shoes: $303/month<br>
</li><li>Cabs: $228/month on transportation<br>
</li><li>Landline phone: $125/month<br>
</li><li>Utilities (Carrie doesn&apos;t have TV, internet, or air conditioning at this time): $60/month<br>
</li><li>Rent (in her rent controlled apartment): $750/month</li></ul><br>
Someone get us our abacus! In the end, the author believes that in the first season of the show, Carrie spent an estimated $22,000 annually while making the aforementioned $15,400. Which would have put her $6,500 in the hole (not including her unpaid taxes and ignored credit card payments).<p></p>
