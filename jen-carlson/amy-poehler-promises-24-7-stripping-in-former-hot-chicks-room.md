										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hotchicksroom031711amyp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034943im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hotchicksroom031711amyp.jpg" width="365" height="220" class="image-right"> </span>Last night we ran into Amy Poehler&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034943/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066436,00.html">and her influence</a>&#x2014;at a party (where her friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034943/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/02/craig_wedren_interview.php">Craig Wedren</a> was performing an intimate set) in the East Village. The very same East Village that recently demanded the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater take down their scandalous &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034943/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotchicksroom">Hot Chicks Room</a>&quot; sign (inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034943/http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=60287&amp;title=hot-chicks-room">this UCB skit</a>). Now that Poehler has banished the sign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034943/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/hot_chicks_room_sign_headed_to_gove.php">to Governors Island</a> as an act of goodwill towards the neighbors (very Leslie Knope of her!), what does she have to say about the whole debacle? Here&apos;s what she told us last night:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I&apos;m happy that something fun and weird came out of it, because that&apos;s the spirit of the theater, and we know it&apos;s important to be good neighbors so we want to do what we can to feel like we&apos;re part of the East Village, which we feel very connected to. 

<p>But I think what&apos;s so great about New York are those small little moments, small little stories. And I hope whoever didn&apos;t like the sign, will like everything that happens inside. And we would love to show them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>And what about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520034943/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/local_comedy_venue_trying_to_turn_e.php">those red velvet curtains</a> that are now making the once pristine neighborhood look like a common whore? Sorry local morality police, Poehler&apos;s not going to bend on those. She told us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;That I <em>refuse</em> to change. Look, I know that when you look outside your window, if there&apos;s something you don&apos;t like, it drives you crazy everyday. But the spirit of the theater has always been cheap, fun entertainment... <strong>Whoever wants to come in, we welcome them, and we&apos;ll show them a good time. That sounds sexual. There will be 24/7 stripping.</strong>&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Please note, NIMBYs: Ms. Poehler is a comedian, and was just kidding about the 24/7 stripping.</p>
