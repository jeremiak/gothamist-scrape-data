<p>This weekend we binge-watched Netflix&apos;s new original series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201407/http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Orange_Is_the_New_Black/70242311?trkid=8133737"><em>Orange Is The New Black</em></a>, based on Brooklynite Piper Kerman&apos;s 2009 novel of the same name. Kerman&apos;s novel tells the true-story of her life inside Danbury, CT&apos;s Federal Prison in 2003, where she served time for a crime she committed in her 20s. That crime was transporting money for her drug-smuggling girlfriend at the time. Following her 15 months on the inside, she wrote the book, and a decade after that, Netflix has released her story as a series. Below, we address any questions, concerns, and thoughts you didn&apos;t even know you had yet about the show, and binge-watching in general. No spoilers!<br>
</p><ul><li>There are 13 episodes, each around one hour long. And, as they have in the past with shows like <em>House Of Cards</em> and <em>Arrested Development</em>, Netflix has released it all at once.<br>
</li><li>Sometimes when there&apos;s a heatwave outside it&apos;s real easy to press play and not turn back, but try to break up your viewings until Science says binge-watching is actually great for our brains. We did so by getting some next level cleaning done... this seems to be A Thing:</li></ul><p></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="pipes0613.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201407im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/pipes0613.jpg" width="230" height="325"> <br> <i style=" width:230px; ;display:block"> The real Piper and Larry</i></div> <ul><li>There are flashbacks during the show, so you won&apos;t remain in prison the entire time. Instead, you&apos;ll get to look back at Piper, and every other character&apos;s life before they entered the prison. This includes New York City flashbacks, so pay attention for mentions of things like seeing The Hungry March Band at Zebulon.<br>
</li><li>Kerman (played by Taylor Schilling) lives in New York City, both now (in Brooklyn) and then. She&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201407/https://twitter.com/piper">pretty active on Twitter</a> the past few days, answering questions from viewers.<br>
</li><li>Kerman (whose last name is Chapman in the show), is engaged to Larry Smith during season one&#x2014;the founder of Smith Magazine (who we&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201407/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/23/larry_smith_fou.php">interviewed</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201407/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/whats_the_history_behind_the.php">twice</a>). He&apos;s played by Jason Biggs on the show.<br>
</li><li>Aside from all that, you may want to go into this not knowing much else about real life Piper, so try not to Google.<br>
</li><li>The show was adapted by Jenji Kohan, the creator of <em>Weeds</em>, and could pretty easily be the story of Nancy Botwin&apos;s life as an inmate. (But like, a lot better than that would have been.)<br>
</li><li>For the first 30 seconds or so of the theme song, you&apos;ll think it&apos;s Karen O, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201407/http://jezebel.com/regina-spektors-song-for-orange-is-the-new-black-is-ca-781927735">it&apos;s Regina Spektor</a> showing she can be a badass, too.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Should you watch it? Yes, it&apos;s pretty great, and was already renewed for a second season. And the cast of characters supporting Schilling is top notch, and includes Natasha Lyonne, Kate Mulgrew, Taryn Manning, Yael Stone, Samira Wiley, and Laura Prepon.</p>
