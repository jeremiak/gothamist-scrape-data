title: Verrazano Bridge Wind Closure!

										<p>About <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005003543/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/12/high_wind_warnings_in_effect_thru_t.php">those high winds</a>: we just got word that the upper level of <strong>the Verrazano Bridge is closed to all traffic in both directions</strong> because of the powerful gusts. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005003543/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/wind_accidents_causing_delays.html">SI Advance</a> is also reporting that the lower level is open with a 20 mph speed restriction. Beware the wind, it&apos;s been wreaking havoc all day&#x2014;and this is all starting to sound a little bit too much like a Stephen King novel.<br>
