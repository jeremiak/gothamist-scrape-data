<p>Before you <em>really</em> met Daria Morgendorffer in 1997, she was a little different&#x2014;somewhere between her cameo on <em>Beavis and Butthead</em> and her own series, she was a flickering black &amp; white animation. Check out the pilot for the show below, which resurfaced sometime last year, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022643/http://www.eonline.com/news/404852/daria-s-5-minute-pilot-surfaces-and-we-don-t-hate-it-translation-we-really-really-love-it?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-topstories&amp;utm_source=eonline&amp;utm_medium=rssfeeds&amp;utm_campaign=rss_topstories">again this week</a>.</p>

<p>Some facts about America&apos;s favorite deadpan, cynical teen:<br>
</p><ul><li><em>Daria</em> first aired just over 16 years ago, on March 3rd, 1997.<br>
</li><li>Creators have said the fictional town of Lawndale is &quot;a mid-Atlantic suburb, outside somewhere like Baltimore or Washington D.C. They could have lived in Pennsylvania near the Main Line, though.&quot;<br>
</li><li>The New York Times called Daria &quot;a blend of Dorothy Parker, Fran Lebowitz, and Janeane Garofalo, wearing Carrie Donovan&apos;s glasses.&quot;<br>
</li><li>The show&apos;s theme song, called &quot;You&apos;re Standing on My Neck,&quot; was written and performed by Splendora.<br>
</li><li>You can still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802022643/http://www.mtv.com/shows/daria/series.jhtml">watch full episodes on MTV.com</a></li></ul><p></p>
