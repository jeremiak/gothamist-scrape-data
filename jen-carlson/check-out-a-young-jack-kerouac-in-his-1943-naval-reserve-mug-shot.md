<p>A youthful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163741/http://gothamist.com/tags/jackkerouac">Jack Kerouac</a> is pictured here in his Naval Reserve &quot;mug shot.&quot; The year was 1943 and Kerouac was just 21-years-old; he had dropped out of Columbia University and the U.S. Merchant Marines at this point. Looking back on his time at the latter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163741/http://www.openculture.com/2013/01/jack_kerouacs_naval_reserve_enlistment_mugshot_1943.html">OpenCulture</a> notes that Kerouac&apos;s motives were personal not patriotic for joining the USMMA in 1942, as he wrote in his journal:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;My mother is very worried over my having joined the Merchant Marine, but I need money for college, I need adventure, of a sort (the real adventure of rotting wharves and seagulls, winey waters and ships, ports, cities, and faces &amp; voices); and I want to study more of the earth, not out of books, but from direct experience.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>By October of 1942 he had left the Merchant Marines, and just a few months later most of the crew of the ship he had been on, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163741/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAT_Dorchester">the Dorchester</a>, was killed when torpedoed by a German U-boat. Around the same time he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve&#x2014;on February 26th, 1943 Kerouac was sent to a training station in Newport, Rhode Island, where this photo was taken... but he didn&apos;t last there more than 10 days.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="kerouac0113a.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163741im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/kerouac0113a.jpeg" width="350" height="319"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block">Kerouac aged well, no?</i></div> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163741/http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2011/fall/kerouac.html">According to files</a> released by the government in 2005, &quot;he was transferred from the Naval Training Station to the Naval Hospital in Newport because he had numerous headaches and &apos;appeared to be restless, apathetic, seclusive. [And a] neuropsychiatric examination disclosed auditory hallucinations, ideas of reference and suicide, and a rambling, grandiose, philosophical manner.&apos;&quot; He was then diagnosed with dementia praecox, or schizophrenia, but Kerouac said this testing was a &quot;folly&quot; and a &quot;farce.&quot; He later told his mother: &quot;as far as I&apos;m concerned I am nervous; I get nervous in an emotional way but I&apos;m not nervous enough to get a discharge.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The next year, in 1944, Kerouac was arrested as a material witness in the murder of David Kammerer&#x2014;which is the focus of the upcoming movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163741/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/photo_daniel_radcliffe_as_allen_gin.php"><em>Kill Your Darlings</em></a>.</p>

<p>But the important thing here is that years of smoking, drinking, going &quot;mad,&quot; and road miles seemed to age Kerouac nicely, no?</p>
