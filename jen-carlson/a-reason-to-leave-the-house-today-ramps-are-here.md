<p>Just as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/ramps.php">that guy we talked to</a> at the greenmarket recently predicted, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">the ramps</a> have arrived in mid-April. First they showed up in restaurant dishes, then at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/http://instagram.com/p/X2mZ9iwSCO/">Dean &amp; Deluca</a>, and now they&apos;re at the Union Square Greenmarket... though on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/http://unionsquaregreenmarket.tumblr.com/day/2013/04/12">the market&apos;s Tumblr</a> they note: &quot;Not many, not huge, but the first ramps are here.&quot;</p>

<p>So even if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/12/please_work_from_home_today.php">worked from home today</a>, we recommend hoofing over there and picking some up, because your weekend will be so much better with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/ramps_have_arrived_celebrate_with_t.php">ramps pesto</a> in it.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, this morning when the skies opened up to pour rain down, God&apos;s hand reached out and picked up the ramp pesto from our kitchen counter and mixed it in with some cream cheese and Ramps Pesto Cream Cheese was born. And it was good. (Seriously, try it. We <em>hear</em> this also works with butter.)</p>

<p>The Greenmarket tends to offer up the biggest bunches for the most reasonable prices (typically $3 to $4 a bunch), but if you want to stay inside and order ramps to have delivered to your door, you can do so via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/https://www.freshdirect.com/product.jsp?catId=lk&amp;productId=veg_grns_ramps&amp;trk=srch">Fresh Direct</a>. Though we must call out the company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806190840/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/02/fresh_direct_nyc_retailers_price_go.php">again</a>, for offering smaller bunches at an inflated price of $5.99 (which they claim is a sale price from $7.99!). Shame on you, Fresh Direct, for tarnishing the holy ramp with your corporate greed.</p>
