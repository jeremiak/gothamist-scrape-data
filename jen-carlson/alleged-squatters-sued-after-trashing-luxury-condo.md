                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="CONDOEV1010.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031071212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/CONDOEV1010.jpg" width="275" height="183" class="image-left"> </span>When the owner of an East Village condo died 12 years ago, two squatters moved in to his old pad, according to the owner&apos;s brother Wahid Sharaf, who is now suing the two for trashing the place. The condo is located at 184 East 2nd Street, reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031071212/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/year_squat_in_ny_pad_Uefw9DvFB7IXduUDxkGHOP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME">the NY Post</a>, and Sharaf says the illegal tenants did $70K worth of damage, causing him to sell it for way below the $900K market price.</p>

<p>The former condo-board president, Raymond Sotnychuk, and a man named Humberto Abenoza allegedly took the condo without permission&#x2014;though Abenoza claims he saved the condo from foreclosure (by paying off debts) with Sharaf&apos;s permission. Eventually Sharaf won the condo back, and he is now suing the men for a total of $273K.</p>

<p>So, what do you think $70K in damages to a luxury condo looks like?</p>
