<p>Seems like just yesterday we were readying our cameras for the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003340/http://gothamist.com/tags/manhattanhenge">Manhattanhenge</a> dates, and here we are again. This weekend, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (and director of the Hayden Planetarium in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003340/http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/resources/starstruck/manhattanhenge/">posted the 2012 dates</a>. If you somehow still haven&apos;t heard of the event, here&apos;s the deal: four times a year, &quot;the setting sun aligns precisely with the Manhattan street grid, creating a radiant glow of light across Manhattan&apos;s brick and steel canyons, simultaneously illuminating both the north and south sides of every cross street of the borough&apos;s grid.&quot; Two of these days you get the full sun, and the other two you get a half sun (both pictured above).</p>

<p>So without further ado, here are your 2012 Manhattanhenge dates:</p>

<p><strong>Half-sun on the grid</strong><br>
Tuesday, May 29th, 8:17 p.m.<br>
Thursday, July 12th, 8:25 p.m.</p>

<p><strong>Full-sun on the grid</strong><br>
Wednesday, May 30th, 8:16 p.m.<br>
Wednesday, July 11th, 8:24 p.m.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, deGrasse also has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003340/http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/resources/starstruck/manhattanhenge/">some tips</a> for those who want to score some sweet photos.</p>
