<p>Twenty years ago today, the world officially met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://gothamist.com/tags/radiohead">Radiohead</a> when they released their debut studio album, <em>Pablo Honey</em>. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/nirvanas_nevermind_turns_20.php">an albumversary like this</a> usually leads to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/296363427524386817">panic attacks</a>, a fleeting mid-life crisis, tearful fits of nostalgia, and an extra therapy session, the band has transformed so much between then and now that this one is less jarring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/28/pearl_jam.php">than others</a>&#x2014;it <em>feels</em> like it&apos;s been twenty years. Over the past two decades Radiohead has never looked back, releasing seven more albums, never derivative of their last... which is possibly why this clip from MTV&apos;s Beach House (circa 1994) has become more and more awkward with each passing year:</p>

<p>And while seeing Thom Yorke performing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://mysocalledsoundtrack.blogspot.com/2011/08/mtv-memories-mtv-beach-house.html">in the broad Hamptons daylight</a> alongside a pool and MTV&apos;s spring breakers is an odd thing to stare at now, the band did credit the network with some of their success. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/07/matt_pinfield_dj.php">we interviewed Matt Pinfield in 2009</a>, he told us a great Radiohead story from the time, recalling: &quot;one of the most amazing and satisfying days for me was when Thom Yorke came in to give us gold records for <em>The Bends</em>... Thom Yorke walked up to us and said, &apos;I know you guys took a lot of shit for staying behind this and backing us on this record. And I just want you to know how much it means to us.&apos; And Thom Yorke actually broke into tears before he walked out of the room. He was literally in tears.&quot;</p>

<p>But let&apos;s get back to two years prior to the release of <em>The Bends</em>&#x2014;in 1993, <em>Pablo Honey</em>&apos;s other charting singles were &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, and &quot;Stop Whispering.&quot; The producers of the album, Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1702359/radiohead-pablo-honey-20th-anniversary.jhtml">MTV News</a>: &quot;When we finished... I thought they could be a really great band... I attribute their amazing leap forward with the fact they had gone out and played for a whole year, and physically became a different band. A great band.&quot; Below, check out some of those live shows, as well as some interviews from that year.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; (live in Chicago, 1993):<br>

<p>&quot;Stop Whispering&quot; (live in Lisbon, 1993): <br>

<p>Here&apos;s an interview from 1993 featuring a very young Thom Yorke and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/10/jonny_greenwood.php">Jonny Greenwood</a>:<br>

<p>Here&apos;s another where they discuss the grunge movement and the future of music (&quot;basically you&apos;re gonna get... every new band that comes out is gonna sound completely unlike every other band. There&apos;s just gonna be fewer and fewer scenes.&quot;) Note how much larger Thom&apos;s hair became by late 1993!:<br>

<p>And did you know the album title is founded right here in New York? The name comes from Queens&apos; natives the Jerky Boys, specifically a prank call that includes the line, &quot;Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!&quot; (The clip is sampled in &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031841/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A9O1yafmPU">How Do You?</a>&quot;).</p>
