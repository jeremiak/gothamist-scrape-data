And <em>for love</em>? We sort of want to believe, since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145949/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/24/pacey_and_joey.php">the whole Pacey thing</a> doesn&apos;t seem to be working out. <p></p>

<p>According to a &quot;friend&quot; of the actor &quot;Tom might be questioning his involvement with the church... &apos;Now he&apos;s lost the most precious thing in his life, he sees that his Scientology beliefs may not have hurt his box office [success] but have ended not one but two marriages.&apos;&quot; It is important to note that this is coming from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145949/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2217521/Tom-Cruise-set-leave-Church-Scientology-bid-win-Katie-Holmes.html#ixzz29OrPEKkg">the Daily Mail</a>, so don&apos;t cue up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145949/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvebovABt6E">that Berlin tune</a> just yet.</p>

<p>For now, the source says, &quot;He hasn&apos;t lost faith completely but he is blaming Scientology for what has happened.&quot; Should the actor decide to leave the &quot;Church,&quot; can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145949/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressive_Person">the SPs</a> even trust him? Maybe this is just the next Phase in some evil plan that also involves Cruise flashing that winning smile? Maybe Katie Holmes knows this and that&apos;s why she&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145949/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2218091/Just-normal-commute-Katie-Holmes-hops-subway-heads-rehearsals-Dead-Accounts.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">hiding out</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145949/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pic-katie-holmes-bumps-into-ethan-hawke-rides-subway-in-nyc-20121210">underground</a> lately? Anyway, trust no one, etc.</p>
