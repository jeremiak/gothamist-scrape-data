His most famous one, of course, was in 1974 when he walked back and forth between the Twin Towers (documented in the Oscar-winning and vertigo-inducing documentary <em>Man on Wire</em>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521231612/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/petit-to-take-a-high-wire-walk-in-midtown/">CityRoom</a> reports that &quot;Petit says he will perform a high-wire walk this fall in Midtown Manhattan. It will be high, it will be long, and it will be outdoors in a very recognizable location that he does not want revealed quite yet&#x2014;discussions are not final.&quot; The walk will be to raise awareness for literacy, and is part of a series of walks he&apos;ll be performing across the country.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Petit will host a benefit screening of <em>Man on Wire</em> (with a Q&amp;A; to follow) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521231612/http://www.stjohndivine.org/ManOnWire.html">this Wednesday</a> at The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, where he holds an office and has been an artist in residence since 1982. Fun fact: he keeps a practice wire strung inside of Synod Hall and &quot;his duties long included changing the light bulbs high in the chandeliers because the cathedral had no other way to do it.&quot;</p>
