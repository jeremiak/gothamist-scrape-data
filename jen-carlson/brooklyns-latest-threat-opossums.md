I Am Opossum</span></i></div> Move over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522003704/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/18/rabid_raccoons_reach_brooklyn.php">rabid raccoons</a>, there&apos;s a new four-legged fiend terrorizing Brooklynites! After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522003704/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/08/early_addition_545.php">we mentioned</a> a opossum sighting in Cobble Hill yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522003704/http://www.yournabe.com/articles/2010/03/09/williamsburg/williamsburg_courier/news/courier-yn_williamsburg_courier-possum.txt">Courier-Life</a> has found out that opossums have been attacking the borough&apos;s gardens, dogs, and teenage girls!<p></p>

<p>Community Board 11 member Marnee Elias-Pavia&apos;s 13-year-old daughter nearly ran into oncoming traffic after spotting the animals&apos;s terrifyingly large nose in Dyker Heights. Wild opossums have also been spotted in Prospect Park, Bay Ridge, and Fort Hamilton; a Coney Island councilmember blames the city for the growing population, saying that when a rat problem took over Marine Park and Gerritsen Beach they brought in opossums to take care of them. Now in some sick Stephen King-eque twist, the population has grown even though they weren&apos;t supposed to be able to reproduce&#x2014;and as one expert says, their pregnancies are quick &quot;like a bowel movement.&quot; </p>

<p>So are we headed towards an opossum takeover? Probably! These nocturnal animals are <em>killing machines</em>&#x2014;one gardener in Carroll Park says she found dead pigeons and mutilated squirrel bodies* scattered about recently. And once they get infected with The Rabies, not even Will Smith will be able to save us.</p>
