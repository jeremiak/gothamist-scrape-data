</div></div><p>The New York Police Department is one of the oldest established departments in the country (beaten out by Boston, who established their police department 7 years earlier). Founded in 1845, by the time these photos were taken (for LIFE magazine) they were already going strong for 92 years. During this time the &quot;world&apos;s toughest&quot; was part of the force (you can read about Detective John Broderick, Shield No. 226, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142001/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842400,00.html">here</a>), and apparently it was totally fine to have magazine photographers take pictures of dead women in homicide investigations!</p>
