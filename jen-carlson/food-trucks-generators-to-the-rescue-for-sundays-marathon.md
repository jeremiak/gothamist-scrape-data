</div></div>					<p>While the NYC Marathon is still on for this Sunday, many (including runners who planned on participating) are hoping the city will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517135745/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/should_the_marathon_be_cancelled_or.php">cancel or postpone</a> in the wake of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517135745/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>. But the city is moving full speed ahead. As we noted earlier, those urging the city to halt the run believe that the thousands of Marathon volunteers could direct their efforts towards post-Sandy relief and cleanup, &quot;and they also argue that the event will divert thousands of police from important hurricane-related duties.&quot; But despite petitions circulating, work started up again yesterday on the Marathon route. </p>

<p>A tipster, who wishes to remain anonymous, told us there were lots of workers in and out of the park today, who had &quot;started before the storm and then came back starting yesterday.&quot; Trailers are lined up from around 71st to 66th Streets on Central Park West, a food truck was set up today, and &quot;generators have been sitting there at least a week.&quot; The tents that were taken down prior to the storm have also been set back up, and there is a stage set up near 73rd Street. </p>

<p>Considering all the volunteer help and NYPD attention that&apos;s already being diverted to the Marathon, the added sight of generators and food being channeled to the event is probably going to strike some New Yorkers as a little misplaced&#x2014;we&apos;re thinking of the ones who are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517135745/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/photos_frustrated_crowds_wait_for_n.php#photo-1">currently lined up waiting for the National Guard</a> to ration out MREs and bottles of water. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to Crain&apos;s, a press conference is happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517135745/https://twitter.com/CrainsNewYork/status/264105530186944512">right now</a>&#x2014;we&apos;ll update when we have more info.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> The Marathon will go on, but Friday&apos;s opening ceremony and Saturday&apos;s 5K race are cancelled.</p>
