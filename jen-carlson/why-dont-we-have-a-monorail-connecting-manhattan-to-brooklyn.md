                            <p>For their <em>Brooklyn Utopias: In TRANSITion</em> exhibition, the Department of Transportation has brought together 19 artists to offer different visions representing their urban ideal in a city shaped by mass transit. Some of these are just cool looking physical things you can touch but don&apos;t really say much about the state of how we move in the city&#x2014;like this cool thing that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071048/http://www.flickr.com/photos/nycstreets/10441738883/in/photostream/">just installed</a>: </p>

<p>While others are like this rendering of a monorail that brings you from Manhattan to Coney Island WHY DON&apos;T WE HAVE THIS? </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Some artists take inspiration from Brooklyn&#x2019;s existing transportation landscape, while others ask the questions, through exaggeratedly Utopian and Dystopian transportation proposals, &apos;Who gets to make decisions about the future of transit?&apos; and, &apos;What role can artists play?&apos;</blockquote>

<p>And also why don&apos;t we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071048/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEZjzsnPhnw">a g-ddamn monorail</a>?</p>

<p>Events will be held throughout <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071048/http://brooklynutopias.wordpress.com/upcoming-exhibitions/">the exhibition</a>, which ends January 12th.</p>
