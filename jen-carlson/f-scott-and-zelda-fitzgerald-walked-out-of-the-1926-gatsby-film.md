<p>Before there was Baz Luhrman and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513140628/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/the_great_gatsby_trailer_is_here.php">comically large</a> bottles of champagne, there was another questionable adaptation of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> brought to the big screen. Before the 1974 film (adapted by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow), and before the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513140628/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041428/">1949 version</a>, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513140628/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby_(1926_film)">the 1926 version</a>, which came out one year after the book.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513140628/http://www.openculture.com/2013/04/the_only_known_footage_of_the_1926_film_adaptation_of_the_great_gatsby.html">Open Culture</a> &quot;the 1926 silent film hasn&#x2019;t been seen in decades. It&#x2019;s simply lost. All that remains of the original 80 minute film is the one minute trailer above. And the ghost of F. Scott Fitzgerald isn&#x2019;t complaining.&quot; When F. Scott and Zelda saw the film in Hollywood, they were not fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513140628/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anne-margaret-daniel/the-great-gatsby-movie-1926_b_3024329.html"><em>and walked out</em></a> before credits rolled, according to HuffPo. Zelda even wrote in a letter: &#x201D;We saw [it] in the movies. It&#x2019;s ROTTEN and awful and terrible and we left.&quot;</p>

<p>The New York Times also reviewed it that year, noting that none of &quot;the players have succeeded in fully developing the characters,&quot; and Daisy &quot;takes enough of this beverage [absinthe] to render the average person unconscious.&quot;</p>
