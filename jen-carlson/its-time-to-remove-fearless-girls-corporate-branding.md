					<p>Fearless Girl will now be courageously staring at the Charging Bull <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404020148/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/27/fearless_girl_statue_to_stay_until.php#photo-1">until at least early 2018</a>, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week. The statue, despite its popularly with selfie-taking tourists, has proven divisive&#x2014;some argue that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404020148/http://gothamist.com/tags/fearlessgirl">Fearless Girl</a> is a powerful symbol for girls and women (&quot;a reminder to all women that no dream is too big,&quot; Public Advocate Letitia James declared), while others contend she infantilizes feminism. But let&apos;s stick to the facts, ma&apos;am...</p>

<p>The fact is that a global corporation with a gender diversity problem commissioned this statue as a publicity stunt&#x2014;the State Street Global Advisors plaque may be just out frame in all the selfies you&apos;re seeing, but it&apos;s still there on the ground Fearless Girl stands upon. We asked street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404020148/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a> about the installation, and he suggested all corporate branding be removed in order to solidify the stronger statement now being placed upon the statue by the masses.</p><blockquote>Initially I thought it was a very well done and thoughtful public disruption. The statue&apos;s placement and her stance, along with the current social/political climate, connected with people on a bunch of levels. But as the story began to unfold, true intent began to reveal itself. The money behind it, the corporate branding. Goddamnit. Just another advertisement. <p></p>

<p>Did she lose a bit of her luster? I think so. But messages have an ability to reach further and go beyond a well-placed logo. If Fearless Girl were to remain, I&apos;d hope all corporate branding would be removed. Leaving the girl to stand on her own. Which is the way it should be. </p></blockquote>This could work. Replacing the fictional young girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404020148/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/fearless_women_statues.php">with a real historical fearless woman</a> could also work. <p></p>

<span class="photo_caption">(Photo by Scott Heins/Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>But are people flocking to the statue even aware that it was put there for any other reason than a feel-good photo op? And is it possible their appreciation for Fearless Girl is actually turning it into something more significant than a mere corporate ad?</p>

<p>We went over there last week to let the tourists huddled around it know about its true origins. Before Mayor de Blasio posed with the statue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404020148/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/27/fearless_girl_statue_to_stay_until.php#photo-1">and extended her lease</a>, Fearless Girl was only meant to be a very temporary advertisement, and now this little statue has become a big moment in this year&apos;s NYC timeline.</p>

<p>One woman, Sarah, was unaware of where the statue came from, telling us, &quot;Well, that&apos;s really interesting. It&apos;s sort of hypocritical. But... coming off of the loss of Clinton, and all of the stuff around Trump, I think it&apos;s a time when people are searching for meaning. And so even if the intention was a marketing gimmick, people are flocking to it because they want to find meaning in something in such a crazy time.&quot; </p>

<p>Bob Patschke, visiting the city from Wisconsin with his wife and 11-year-old daughter, was also unaware of the statue&apos;s promotional purpose. When the plaque was pointed out to him, Patschke was unfazed#8212;&quot;The fact that they&apos;re doing that means they&apos;re making a statement towards empowering women to break into that market. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that that company is keeping women out of their company, but they&apos;re always going to do what&apos;s best for them. I don&apos;t see any issue with that.&quot; The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404020148/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/too-bad-that-statue-of-a-girl-staring-down-the-wall-street-bull-is-a-pr-stunt-by-wall-street-patriarchs-9749317">has only five women</a> on their board (out of 23).</p>

<p>To that, Lisa Matthews, a 46-year-old visiting from Louisiana, declared: &quot;I&apos;m not a big affirmative action fan. I think if you can do the job, you should be hired. I don&apos;t think there needs to be a certain number of women just because they&apos;re women, or a certain number of minorities just because they&apos;re minorities. I&apos;ve been a woman business owner for 21 years and I&apos;ve never felt discriminated against. My profession is 75 to 80 percent male, I don&apos;t feel like my sex has ever been held against me.&quot; Matthews&apos;s son posed with Fearless Girl while wearing a MAGA hat.</p>

<p>Amanda O&apos;Brien, visiting from New Mexico with her mother Roberta, was not bothered by those who bankrolled the statue&#x2014;&quot;I think the gesture might have seemed a little empty, but all of the traction that it&apos;s getting is really great. I think as more people come to see this kind of attraction, it opens others&apos; eyes to having more women on boards of these large companies. It&apos;s opening a lot of eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>Turhan Clause, 52, a Union iron worker from Niagara Falls, posed with the statue so he could send a photo to his teenage niece. &quot;There&apos;s a lot more to it,&quot; Clause said, &quot;I&apos;m a Native American, and we&apos;ve been oppressed with that Dakota Access pipeline, and in my opinion the President was very disrespectful, the way he spoke about women. A lot of our Native women went to D.C. a month ago to try and protest. I have a niece that&apos;s about 17 years old and she&apos;s up and coming in leadership in her own. She went to the Dakota Access Pipeline to protest. She&apos;s been at youth and elders conferences. I&apos;ll be sending her the pictures. It represents just a little bit more of equality.&quot;</p>

<p>As Nick Pinto at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404020148/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/too-bad-that-statue-of-a-girl-staring-down-the-wall-street-bull-is-a-pr-stunt-by-wall-street-patriarchs-9749317">the Village Voice</a> summed up, &quot;However much State Street may profess to care about women in positions of corporate executive power, its track record doesn&apos;t suggest that it cares much about the sort of women who rely on pensions to survive their later years.&quot; They also could not confirm if they would be adding more women to their board, which further suggests this statue &#x2014; so long as it comes with State Street&apos;s logo &#x2014; is an empty gesture. Let Fearless Girl stay, let her stand as a strong symbol to women, but it&apos;s time to remove the plaque.</p>
