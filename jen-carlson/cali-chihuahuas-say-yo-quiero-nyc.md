The good news is that New York has so many cute Chihuahuas on their way from California! The bad news is that they&apos;re coming from overcrowded shelters after being abandoned by fairweather owners. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926201613/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/pets/2009/12/11/2009-12-11_calif_chihuahuas_hightail_it_to_city.html">the Daily News</a> dozens of the doggies will be here in the next few weeks, and the ASPCA&apos;s adoption center here thinks they&apos;ll be able to find good homes for them. While demand has gone down in Cali, animal lovers in New York love the pint-size pup because they&apos;re so portable and can live in tiny apartments.</p>

<p>This story shows why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926201613/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/08/daily_candy.php">Daily Candy recently suggesting</a> miniature piglets as holiday gifts was such an ill-conceived idea. As experts told the News, the recent overflow of Chihuahuas can be blamed partly on &quot;fans who hoped to emulate celebs like Paris Hilton, but later became bored with the little creatures and abandoned them.&quot;</p>
