<p><em>Bayside! The Musical!</em>, the unauthorized musical parody of <em>Saved By The Bell</em>, scored a cameo from Mr. Belding earlier this month, and now they&apos;ve announced Dustin Diamond will come play along. The campy production, which is held inside Theatre 80 on St. Marks Place, will bring the real Screech to the stage on March 27th, 28, and 29th (you can buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150604103406/http://baysidethemusical.com/tickets/">tickets here</a>). </p>
