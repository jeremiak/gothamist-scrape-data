                            <p>Listen, all of our friends are <em>just fine</em>, but have you ever pined for new, more awesome friends who, like, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/https://twitter.com/jenist/statuses/336577871206309889"><em>own a boat</em></a><em>?</em> Or for money with which you could procure your own vessel? Well, life isn&apos;t like some big flashy Hollywood movie, and statistically neither of those things are going to happen for most of us, so we&apos;re going to need to tap into our powerful imaginations and just pretend we own a boat. The best way to do this is to head over to the Citi Bike of Sailboats: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/http://www.manhattanbysail.com/">Manhattan By Sail</a>, where you&apos;ll get a wooden schooner, a sun-kissed captain, and the wind in your hair. </p>

<p>You have probably seen their fleet on the city&apos;s rivers before, perhaps referring to them as &quot;the pirate ships&quot;&#x2014;we were told the crew doesn&apos;t really like this, but that really is what they look like from afar. This is not your little cousin from New Jersey&apos;s party boat, this is a beautiful wooden sailboat. <br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="clippercity614.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/clippercity614.jpeg" width="350" height="286"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Clipper City</i></div> Some Gothamist staffers finally took a spin in one of them (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/http://www.manhattanbysail.com/About-Us/Our-Boats/Clipper-City-More-Information/">Clipper City</a>) last night for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/http://www.manhattanbysail.com/sails/view-sails/Clipper%20City/Lobster%20&amp;%20Beer%20Lovers%20Sail/25/">Lobster &amp; Beer Lovers Sail</a>, and we&apos;re honestly not just saying this because the $89 tickets were comped: it was freakin&apos; spectacular. Some may even say: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/http://instagram.com/p/bASPubPYde/">life affirming</a>.<p></p>

<p>Their two ships have themed sails, like the Lobster &amp; Beer one we went on (for the $89 you get an open beer bar for the two hour sail, and two full-size Luke&apos;s Lobster rolls, with some fixins of potato salad, cole slaw, and pickles). There&apos;s also a champagne brunch sail, a happy hour sail, a full moon sail, and so on. Also, once a month there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/http://www.manhattanbysail.com/sails/view-sails/Clipper%20City/Tops%20n%20Tails%20Sail/22/">a gay and lesbian night</a> and we&apos;re told that all of the crew members take their shirts off (seriously). </p>

<p>The least expensive option seems to be the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/http://www.manhattanbysail.com/sails/view-sails/Shearwater/Happy%20Hour%20Sail/23/">Happy Hour Sail</a>, which costs $25 and offers a cash bar with 1/2 price drinks (the other sails hover around the $50 price, but always offer something in the way of free drinks). And the most expensive sail costs $1600 (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090359/http://www.manhattanbysail.com/sails/view-sails/Shearwater/Late%20Night%20Rendezvous%20Sail/7/">Late Night Rendezvous Sail</a>) where you and your guest get the sailboat to yourself for 90 minutes (this one includes a bottle of Veuve Cliquot). One concern we had was overcrowding&#x2014;but since the weather last night was hot and it looked like a storm was coming, our boat was pretty empty, which made it seem like for a couple of hours we really did own our own schooner. However, a rep on the boat told us there are usually over 100-150 people, so expect to mingle. </p>

<p>The sails take off from Pier 17 at South Street Seaport, and if you are worried about overcrowding, get there a little early and check in on how many tickets have been sold the specific sail you&apos;re looking to go on. Click through for a look at the sail from last night, including the views you&apos;ll see along the way.</p>
