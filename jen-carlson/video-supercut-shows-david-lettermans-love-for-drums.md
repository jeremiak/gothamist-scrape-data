<p>Have you ever noticed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173241/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidletterman">David Letterman</a> always talks to the drummers after a band finishes their song on the <em>Late Show</em>? Neither have we. But luckily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173241/http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2013/6/Check-out-this-montage-of-David-Letterman-talking-to-drummers">CBC Music</a> noticed, and created a montage of clips from over the years where Letterman asks, &quot;Are these your drums, or rentals? Those are beautiful.&quot; But what else would you expect from a man who held a Drum Solo Week on his show?</p>
