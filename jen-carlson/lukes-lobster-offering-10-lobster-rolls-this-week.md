<p>Starting this Thursday, and lasting through Saturday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006171521/http://lukeslobster.com/">Luke&apos;s Lobster</a> will be selling $10 lobster rolls on their truck (and on Thursday only this same price will apply at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006171521/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/lukes_lobster_opening_in_adorable_b.php">their new Brooklyn Bridge location</a>). This is $5 less than their average lobster roll price, and co-owner Ben Conniff explains, &quot;We&apos;re able to offer this astounding discount because we worked with the Maine Lobster Council to get tons of lobster donated for the cause.&quot; They&apos;ll be donating proceeds to the Mayor&apos;s Sandy relief fund, and Coniff points out, &quot;The only other time we&apos;ve sold rolls so inexpensively was in the hours before the hurricane.&quot; Here&apos;s the schedule:</p>

<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> Our truck will sell the rolls from its normal spot at 57th and Broadway. Bonus: Thursday only we will also sell $10 rolls from our newest outpost in Brooklyn Bridge Park.<br>
<strong>Friday:</strong> The truck will sell from its regular spot at 47th and Madison.<br>
<strong>Saturday:</strong> The truck will sell from its regular spot at Hoboken&apos;s Pier 13 (proceeds to go to New Jersey relief).</p>

<p>And did you know that New Yorkers love lobster rolls THE MOST? Lobster Council Acting Director Marianne LaCroix pointed: &#x201C;New Yorkers have always been there for our industry, as the biggest devotees of Maine Lobster and the classic Lobster Roll.&#x201D;</p>
