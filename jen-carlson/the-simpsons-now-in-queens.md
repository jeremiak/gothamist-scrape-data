<p>Artist Kyle McCoy recently completed a 10-foot by 4-foot, three-dimensional model of Springfield from <em>The Simpsons</em>, made entirely of perler beads (featuring 130,000 individually placed pixels!).  Even Comic Book Guy would agree, this is the <em>best. perler bead constructed art piece. ever.</em>, and it&apos;s set to be unveiled on April 2nd in Forest Hills, Queens.  We&apos;ll be there when it is, and will return with plenty of images... but for now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152107/http://www.midnight-buffet.com/project-springfield.html">enjoy this preview</a>. More details on how and why this was all created can be found in the video below:</p>
