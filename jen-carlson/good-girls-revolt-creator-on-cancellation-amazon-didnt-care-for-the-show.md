<p>I was pretty excited for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164803/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/28/good_girls_revolt_history.php"><em>Good Girls Revolt</em></a> prior to its debut in October&#x2014;the original series for Amazon, based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164803/https://www.amazon.com/Good-Girls-Revolt-Newsweek-Workplace/dp/1610393260">book by Lynn Povich</a>, concerned the real life events in 1970 that challenged and defied the patriarchal world of journalism. But the execution was a little disappointing&#x2014;it felt empty, more focused on love affairs around the office than the real-life compelling story, and the important issues mostly ended up falling to the background. The costumes were also distracting, as they seemed to be straight out of a cheap Halloween costume store, and this added to the feeling that a serious topic was not being approached seriously at all.</p>

<p>But did the show deserve to be cancelled within weeks of its premiere? It wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164803/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/22/is_scorseses_vinyl_good_yet.php"><em>Vinyl</em> bad</a>, after all, and at points it did have a glimmer of the show that I was hoping for, particularly in the final episode. Anyway, it seems like they could have given the show another season to hit its stride and find its way.</p>

<p>The studio is letting creator Dana Calvo and producer Sony Pictures Television shop it around for a second season pick-up elsewhere, so it&apos;s possible that will still happen. In the meantime, Calvo is now speaking out against Amazon, and specifically the studio head Roy Price, claiming: &quot;He didn&apos;t know the characters&apos; names.&quot; She believes he simply cancelled the show because he didn&apos;t &quot;care for&quot; it.</p>

<p>She told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164803/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-girls-revolt-creator-slams-amazon-cancellation-they-run-some-people-953552">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, &quot;We were all so surprised because we were a hit. Of the people driven from the entertainment sections to the commerce section, we were driving 55 percent, which was phenomenal.&quot; (She also cited a high <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164803/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/good_girls_revolt/s01/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score, for whatever that is worth.) </p>

<p>Streaming monitor Symphony Advanced Media VP John Sollecito told THR, &quot;It&apos;s really the only Amazon program that we&apos;ve seen to date that has a really strong female 18-to-49 following.&quot; But Amazon&apos;s head of comedy and drama Joe Lewis says Symphony&apos;s numbers are no good, alleging that they &quot;are wrong and that the show wasn&#x2019;t performing at the levels we had hoped for&#x2014;either in total viewership or completion rates.&quot; Lewis also allegedly asked if the show could &quot;be redeveloped as a comedy&quot;! SIGH.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the first episode, which did open with some promise:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some fans have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164803/http://www.thepetitionsite.com/827/317/952/">started a petition</a> &quot;to demand Amazon, Netflix, HBO, or Hulu pick up the show.&quot;</p>
