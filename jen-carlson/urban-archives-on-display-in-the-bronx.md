</div></div>					<p>The Bronx Museum recently opened an exhibit featuring Bronx &quot;artifacts&quot; from 1971 to present day. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520002933/http://www.bronxmuseum.org/urbanarchives.html">Urban Archives: That Was Then This Is Now</a> is &quot;the first of a new, multi-year series of exhibitions that look at contemporary culture as a living archive.&#x201D; This one was drawn primarily from personal collections of artists that have been working in and on the Bronx for decades, and &quot;in their collections, the testimonies of long-time residents and occasional visitors coexist in the form of mementos, documentation, artwork and other sort of cultural artifacts.&quot; Check it out sometime between now and March 1st.</p>
