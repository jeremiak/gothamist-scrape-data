<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810044606/http://twitter.com/#!/Gothamist/status/149223372981665793">we were very happy</a> when The Internet delivered Callin&apos; Oates, a hotline that allows you to get your Hall &amp; Oates fix 24/7 by simply callingl 719-26-OATES. After that you&apos;ll be prompted to press 1 for &quot;One On One,&quot; 2 for &quot;Rich Girl,&quot; 3 for &quot;Maneater,&quot; and 4 for &quot;Private Eyes.&quot; Phone battery dead? No problem, someone put the experience on YouTube: </p>

<p>Word of the secret sonic nostalgia number spread fast, and its creator was discovered soon after. Michael Selvidge, a newcomer to Twilio&apos;s communications department, started the whole thing&#x2014;and the company has documented its viral success <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810044606/http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/12/hall-oates-on-speed-dial-viral-success-powered-by-twilio.html">here</a>. But with so much attention, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810044606/http://www.callinoates.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810044606/http://twitter.com/#!/CallinOates">Twitter</a> account attached to the project, it couldn&apos;t last long, right? You know, copyrights and stuff! Well, Merry Christmas one and all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810044606/http://www.tmz.com/2011/12/25/hall-and-oates-callin-oates/#.TvczWEr_5dc">TMZ</a> says that Hall &amp; Oates have no plan on stopping the fun. A rep for the group told the site that &quot;they&apos;re thrilled so many people are calling the number and listening to their music... &apos;We had nothing to do with it and we&apos;re still trying to to process what the company&apos;s intentions are. But we&apos;re always happy when people are interested in our music.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Fun fact: Daryl Hall now lives in upstate New York, where he films <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810044606/http://www.livefromdarylshouse.com/">Live From Daryl&apos;s House</a>, but he used to live in this writer&apos;s hometown, where he drove a red sports car with the novelty plate: &quot;HALL.&quot; That was probably around the time the duo recorded this:</p>
