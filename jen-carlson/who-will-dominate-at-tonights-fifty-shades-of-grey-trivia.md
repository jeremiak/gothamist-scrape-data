Tonight is their night!</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095703/https://www.facebook.com/events/372873796119418/">this Facebook invite</a>, &quot;Five rounds of lip-biting trivia about the most sheltered technically clueless college graduate to ever fall into the arms of the ultimate bad boy sadistic billionaire with a heart of gold&quot; will be going down at the Pig &amp; Whistle on West 47th Street at 8 p.m. Start thinking of your trivia team names now&#x2014;we recommend lifting a full quote for this, from one of the many lexical gems offered up by James in her books.

<p>The night is sponsored by The Museum of Sex, naturally, and you have to make reservations by calling (212) 302-0112. Oddly, there&apos;s no mention of prizes, but we assume whoever <em>dominates</em> will walk away with a shiny new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095703/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/16/photos_old_timey_scary-looking_vibr.php#photo-5">Oster Stim-U-Lax</a>.</p>
