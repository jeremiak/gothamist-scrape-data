<span class="photo_caption">Max&apos;s Kansas City menu, circa the 1970s</span></p>

<p>After CBGB&apos;s name was dragged through the corporate mud <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234144/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/28/cbgb_newark_airport.php">all the way to Newark, NJ</a>, a parody menu for the airport restaurant surfaced. Velveeta Underground, Patty Melt Smith, Legs McMuffin, you get the idea. It was meant as a jab at the cultural appropriation of the legendary rock club. But back in the day, Max&apos;s Kansas City&apos;s drink menu looked very similar. The Heartbreakers, Blondie, Patti Smith, Suicide... &quot;Support your fave band!&quot; is what patrons were instructed at the top of their &quot;New York Rock Drink&quot; menu.</p>

<p>While Max&apos;s Kansas City had three incarnations, and two addresses, if you count the failed attempt at revival in the 1990s, the original was at 213 Park Avenue South. That one, which operated from 1965 to 1974, and 1975 to 1981, is where this menu is from (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234144/https://twitter.com/DavidWondrich/status/681968828373430273">circa 1976</a>, to be exact).</p>

<p>There&apos;s not a whole lot of documentation of the club, as owner Mickey Ruskin didn&apos;t allow many to capture what was going on inside, but below is some footage that allows a glimpse into the debauchery. This was part of the Steven Kasher gallery show, which ran in tribute to Max&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234144/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/05/artists_remember_maxs_kansas_city.php#photo-1">in 2010</a>.</p>
