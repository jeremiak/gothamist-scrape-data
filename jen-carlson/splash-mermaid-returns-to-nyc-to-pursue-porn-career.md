<p>Last time we saw Madison, the mermaid in <em>Splash</em>, she was swimming along the ocean floor to an underwater kingdom with her true love Allen Bauer. (We should note here that we don&apos;t count anything that happened in <em>Splash, Too</em>.) Anyway, Madison apparently came back to the big city, and has since fallen on tough times. Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082007/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/live_nude_girls_spotted_in_midtown.php">that porn scene</a> a Midtown employee spotted from his office earlier this week? That was her! Albeit, sans tail, and sans that Tom Hanks-looking guy.</p>

<p>Okay, so it was really porn star DarrylHanahxxx, who really does look exactly like the adult entertainment industry&apos;s version of Daryl Hannah! Anyway, the poor dear was injured during the shoot&#x2014;but it seems like your standard sex cramp. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082007/http://twitter.com/#!/DarrylHanahxxx">Tweeted</a> the below photo and explained, &quot;Relaxing on my private balcony with an Icy/Hot Patch&#x2014;since I&apos;m still limping a little.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="porncramps0811.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160709082007im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/porncramps0811.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>For the full shoot you&apos;ll have to pick up a future issue of Velvet Magazine, which is what this was for. Also, their tagline is: HardcoreSex Fucking. C&apos;mon Ms. Hanahxxx, you could do better&#x2014;they could make some really great fetishist porns based off <em>Splash</em> and <em>Roxeanne</em>.</p>
