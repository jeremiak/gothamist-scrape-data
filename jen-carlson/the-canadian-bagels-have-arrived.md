										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:262px; "> <img alt="montrealbagels.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/montrealbagels.jpg" width="262" height="350"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo by Conrad Doucette</span></i></div> Certain Brooklyn bagelheads have been heading to Mile End Deli in Boerum Hill today to snatch up some specially-delivered bagels from Montreal. The bagels, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114/http://www.stviateurbagel.com/">St-Viateur bagel bakery</a>, are $2.50 a pop (or a dozen for $22) and traveled overnight to get here. The folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114/http://www.brokelyn.com/a-canadian-bagel-for-2-50-le-brokavore-says-mais-non/">Brokelyn</a> think this is <em>tr&#xE8;s absurde</em>, saying, &quot;There are so many things wrong with this scenario that the mind reels trying to count them.&quot; They suggest hitting up the Bagel Hole for an 80 cent doughy delight.<p></p>

<p>Like it or not, these bagels made it past border control, and they will continue to every Saturday, indefinitely. Originally the ex-pat owner at Mile End, Noah Bernamoff, was having them shipped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114/http://www.stviateurbagel.com/products/?rand=1023015644">via Fed Ex</a>, but that yielded not-so-fresh results. And as for the pricetag, one half of the delivery duo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114/http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Mile+Brooklyn+Bagel+Express/2620130/story.html">Joel Tietolman</a>, says, &quot;When we considered that H&amp;H;, the New York equivalent to our St. Viateur, sells their bagels for $16.80 a dozen, $20 for bagels hand-made in Montreal and driven in overnight is a pretty good deal, and much tastier.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s suggested that you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114/http://www.mileendmontrealbagel.com/">pre-order here</a>, where they also note: &quot;The Montreal Bagel is unlike any other style of bagel. Some attribute this to Montreal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/10/florida_baker_recreates_brooklyn_wa.php">tap water</a>, used for the dough as well as a honey boiling process prior to the bagels being baked in a wood burning oven. Compared to New York Bagel, the Montreal bagel is smaller, denser, chewier, and slightly sweet.&quot; Let us know if you try one!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE!:</strong> NY1 anchor, and Canadian, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529034114/http://www.patspapers.com/">Pat Kiernan</a> tells us...<br>
</p><blockquote>&quot;I really like the wood-fired bagels. But it&apos;s nothing like a New York bagel. It&apos;s got a tougher texture and isn&apos;t as big. I think the Montreal style is great in the toaster.<p></p>

<p>If you think the NY bagel is the perfect bagel don&apos;t change your routine. But if you want to give it a try, you should. You might like it. I do. My New York born kids, on the other hand, want no part of the Montreal bagels. &apos;That&apos;s not a real bagel,&apos; my daughter Lucy informed me last week in Vancouver when I gave her a Montreal-style.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>
