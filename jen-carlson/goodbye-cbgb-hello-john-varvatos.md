<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614112812/http://racked.com/archives/2007/10/19/breaking_inside_the_cbgb_demol.php">demolition was underway</a> at the former CBGB. At the time Racked put their money on a Duane Reade taking over the space, but today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614112812/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10232007/news/regionalnews/cbgb_to_be_chic_boutique.htm">The Post</a> reports that John Varvados will be opening a chic boutique in the old punk rock palace. With his eye on a Spring opening, it&apos;s unclear how much of the 13,000 square feet will be taken over by the designer. </p>

<p>Before you get your black leather punk panties in a bunch, let&apos;s take a look at Varvatos. Last year he made Iggy Pop his model, putting him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614112812/http://www.fashionweekdaily.com/news/fullstory.sps?inewsid=340748&amp;itype=8486">in a pinstripe suit</a> in Central Park and making the CBGB-alum a new face of fashion. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614112812/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2007/09/26/efhack126.xml">most legendary rockers love Varvatos</a> -- the Detroit designer has put Slash, Ryan Adams and Alice Cooper in his threads. Cooper even told the press at Fashion Week last month &quot;Everything I&apos;m wearing is John Varvatos now.&quot; What&apos;s more, Mr. V also makes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614112812/http://www.zappos.com/gs/converseandreg-by-john-varvatos-footwear-womens.shtml">his own Converse</a> -- just like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614112812/http://www.eastbay.com/catalog/productdetail/supercat--home/model_nbr--84680/sku--1007331/cm--57831P/">the Ramones</a>. So we&apos;re betting he&apos;ll keep the CBGB feel in his new Bowery boutique -- it&apos;ll just smell better, and cost more.</p>
