title: Free 50 Cent Concert Raises Concerns In Queens

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="50centbulletproofqueens.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801041737im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/50centbulletproofqueens.jpg" width="250" height="314" class="image-left"> </span>&quot;Superstar rapper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801041737/http://gothamist.com/tags/50cent">50 Cent</a> is secretly planning to stage a free concert in a schoolyard near the Queens projects where he grew up,&quot; reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801041737/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08172009/news/regionalnews/fears_of_a_50_free_for_all_184932.htm">the NY Post</a>, as they simultaneously destroy any secretive nature of said concert. The performance will be at P.S. 40 in Jamaica (August 30th, 5:30 p.m.), and will be open to anyone&#x2014;one NYPD officer warning the paper it would be difficult for them to control the area. A worried local added, &quot;Someone&apos;s gonna try to make a name for themselves. They&apos;re gonna take a shot at him, and they&apos;re either gonna hit him or they&apos;re gonna miss him and hit some poor, innocent kid or grandmother.&quot; But let&apos;s be real, grandmas probably won&apos;t be front row and center, right?</p>

<p>If the permits go through (which they are expected to this week), the plan is to shut down a 20-block area surrounding the stage, and dispatch &quot;an army of cops.&quot; But maybe the fact that the day is being partially sponsored by the New York Restoration Project, a nonprofit founded by Bette Midler, will make things more peaceful? Either way, some locals are planning day trips to other areas, and even teens expressed concern; one telling the paper, &quot;There&apos;s word out there that there&apos;s going to be some shootings. Some of my friends&apos; parents are saying that they don&apos;t want them to go because something is going to happen.&quot;</p>

<p>For those who want to see the rapper but don&apos;t want to put themselves in harm&apos;s way, Fitty is playing Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey the night before, where the only danger will be getting hit by some backsplash from the log flume.</p>
