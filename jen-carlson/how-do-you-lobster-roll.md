</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s always so much talk in the summer surrounding who has <em>the best</em> lobster roll in New York City&#x2014;but is there really a best, or are writers just looking for an excuse to eat (and expense) 16 lobster rolls? Recently a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170055/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-21/marathon-lobster-roll-hunt-has-three-n-y-winners-ryan-sutton.html">Bloomberg News</a> reporter had exactly that many, and came out with this bit of knowledge: &quot;New York&#x2019;s best lobster rolls cost half as much as New York&#x2019;s best-known lobster rolls.&quot; </p>

<p>Indeed, these suckers can get pricey, so if you want to splurge, you want to know how what you&apos;re getting, right? Hot dog bun or brioche, chips or fries... with so many preferences over how the dish is prepped, the biggest debate has to revolve around how it&apos;s dressed&#x2014;butter or mayo, lightly dressed or drenched.</p>

<p>As far as the best of the best goes, if you want to know what the experts say: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170055/http://tastingtable.com/lander/clawoff">Tasting Table</a> recently hosted a Claw-Off, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170055/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/06/09/lukes-lobster-declared-nycs-top-lobster-roll/">declaring Luke&apos;s Lobster</a> the best lobster roll in the city. This seems a popular opinion, as that aforementioned Bloomberg writer also declared Luke&#x2019;s Lobster, along with Red Hook Lobster Pound, to serve up the best. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170055/http://nymag.com/guides/summer/2010/66749/">New York Magazine</a> also has a drool-inducing guide to NYC&apos;s best rolls.) But what do you think? We asked our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170055/http://www.twitter.com/gothamist">Twitter</a> followers yesterday, and here were the most Tweeted back answers.</p>
