<p>Are you safely tucked away in your apartment wondering what it looks like outside? Or are you far from Sandy&apos;s path and just want to watch New York City get <em>Day After Tomorrow</em>ed?</p>

<p>There are tons of Livestreams catching the action around the city, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030731/http://new.livestream.com/breakinglivenowdirect/sandycam">SandyCam</a>, which is at Livestream&apos;s HQ downtown. Last night they told us, &quot;we&apos;ve installed a Sandy Cam on our roof to capture Sandy as she makes her way through New York&apos;s Hudson River and Skyline,&quot; and they&apos;re going beyond the typical static footage, with citizen journalists on the ground, as well as user-footage they&apos;re aggregating. They add there is &quot;live photo, text, and video updates in addition to chat features so folks can tune in from around the world&quot; (as you can imagine, this chat feature is... colorful). At press time someone is reporting live from Rockaway Beach, where the beach has disappeared under massive waves and rising water.</p>

<p>If you want a different view, the SandyCam <em>is</em> grabbing static views from places other than the Livestream HQ, but you can also check out Sandy from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030731/http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_hd">the Statue of Liberty</a> cam; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030731/http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/timessquare/">Times Square</a> cam; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030731/http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/columbuscircle/">Columbus Circle</a> cam; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030731/http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/brooklynbridge/">the Brooklyn Bridge</a> cam; and you can even watch over those cranes that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030731/http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/worldtradecenter/?cam=tower1cu">are still on top of 1WTC</a>.</p>
