<p>Feel guilty about using an Airbnb rental to host a huge rager? Enter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153819/http://eventup.com/">Eventup</a>, which is like your new best friend whose parents go away a lot... except this &quot;friend&quot; charges you a bunch of money to hang. The service, which will be running out of New York City by later this month, allows property owners to rent out their vacant spaces to those who need a sweet spot to host an event. Right now you can score <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153819/http://eventup.com/venue/bob-dylans-former-home/">Bob Dylan&apos;s former digs</a> in Midtown East (for $32,000), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153819/http://eventup.com/venue/katherine-hepburns-former-home/">Katherine Hepburn&apos;s East Side brownstone</a> ($25,000), and the East Village walk-up that Lady Gaga once resided in.</p>

Sadly, none of Andy Warhol&apos;s old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153819/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/that_time_andy_warhols_landlord_war.php">Factory spaces</a> have turned up in a search, but we probably couldn&apos;t even afford 15 minutes in one of those places.</p>
