title: Video: Das Racist Bring Michael Jackson Back To Life, Search For City's Best Dosas
---

	
										<p>Last night, New York&apos;s own Das Racist made their television debut on Conan O&apos;Brien to perform their song &quot;Michael Jackson,&quot; and, naturally, brought a very realistic Michael Jackson impersonator with them. It&apos;s part creepy, part amazing, and totally perfect (or according to some people, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165921/https://twitter.com/#!/dasracist/status/141461748736720896">the worst</a>&quot;). Also it sort of makes us feel like maybe Michael Jackson isn&apos;t dead, and is now going to enter the &quot;Elvis is still alive&quot; phase of his post-mortem existence.</p>

<p>How can Das Racist possibly top bringing back the King of Pop? Glad you asked! Himanshu &quot;Heems&quot; Suri and Stereogum&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165921/http://amritsingh.tumblr.com/">Amrit Singh</a> have an upcoming independent documentary coming out (called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165921/http://dosahunt.tumblr.com/post/9634248717/dosa-hunt-coming-soon">Dosa Hunt</a>), which also features DR&apos;s Ashok Kondabolu. The premise is simple: search Manhattan and Queens for the best dosa, and do it in &quot;a van decorated like an Indian Disco.&quot; The doc will also star jazz pianist Vijay Iyer, Alan Palomo (Neon Indian, Vega), Anand Wilder (Yeasayer), and Rostam Batmanglij (Vampire Weekend, Discovery). For that project, you can get more info at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165921/http://dosahunt.com/">DosaHunt.com</a>&#x2014;we&apos;re told the trailer will premiere before the new year.</p>
