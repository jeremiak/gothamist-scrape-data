<p>Last night someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1rlsj7/you_should_know_that_3_unpublished_stories/">posted on Reddit</a> that three unpublished stories by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://gothamist.com/tags/jdsalinger">J.D. Salinger</a> had leaked, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ocean_Full_of_Bowling_Balls"><em>The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls</em></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_Boy_(story)"><em>Birthday Boy</em></a>, and <em>Paula</em>. Two of these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://www.geocities.com/deadcaulfields/Texas.html">are held by</a> The Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin, who hold a few of the late author&apos;s letters and manuscripts in their archives, and another is at Princeton. However, a hard copy of a book called <em>Three Stories</em> (containing all of the aforementioned) was just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://www.ebay.com/itm/Three-Stories-UNPUBLISHED-JD-Salinger-catcher-rye-First-Edition-/271283737560">sold on eBay</a> for around $100&#x2014;the inside of the book has the number 6, and it states: &quot;This book was printed in a run of 25 numbered copies.&quot;</p>

<p>Salinger scholar Kenneth Slawenski confirmed the stories were not phonies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://www.buzzfeed.com/summeranne/three-unpublished-jd-salinger-stories-have-allegedly-leaked">to Buzzfeed</a> over email, saying, &#x201C;While I do quibble with the ethics (or lack of ethics) in posting the Salinger stories, they look to be true transcripts of the originals and match my own copies.&#x201D;</p>

<p>One of the stories, <em>Paula</em>, was what Salinger referred to as a &quot;horror story (my first and last),&quot; at the time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://deadcaulfields.com/Unpublished.html#Paula">called <em>Mrs Hincher</em></a>. If you&apos;re feeling unethical, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140923234103/http://imgur.com/a/64v5t#E8C0BMj">you can read them all here</a>... though Salinger wouldn&apos;t want you to for another 47 years.</p>
