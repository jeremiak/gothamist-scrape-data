Previously it was unknown what they wanted in these brownstones: organic food from the Co-op? A copy of <em>Freedom</em>? But in light of a recent incident, we can say with confidence that these raccoons are after <em>the cats</em>. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063646/http://parkslope.patch.com/articles/for-one-kitten-wildlife-home-invasion-turns-deadly">Park Slope Patch</a> tells the tale of Brooklynite Justin Hogan, and the grisly scene he walked into upon returning home one recent morning. Last week, Hogan entered his 3rd Street apartment and noticed a screen was torn out of the window frame, looking down he saw bloody paw prints, and then... his 6-month-old tabby Nigel lying lifeless in the bathtub (heartbreakingly noting that the tub is where the kitten would go when he was scared). </p>

<p>Hogan described the scene as &quot;gruesome, like blood-spattered-on-the-wall gruesome.&quot; He believes a raccoon is the prime suspect, due to the bloody paw marks and claw marks all over a shredded bag of cat treats. He believes it got there by climbing a tree onto the roof just below his window. The press officer with the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation says, &quot;It is unusual for a raccoon to kill a cat. Very unusual. It does sound like something was wrong with this raccoon for this to happen, and most likely that would be rabies.&quot; (The borough <em>is</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115063646/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/08/is_brooklyn_the_new_hot_spot_for_ra.php">the new hot spot</a> for rabid raccoons.)</p>

<p>To wash away this horrific scene from our mind, let&apos;s watch this clip of Alf... who joked about eating cats <em>but never actually followed through with it</em> (at least, not in the Tanner household). Follow his lead, raccoons.</p>
