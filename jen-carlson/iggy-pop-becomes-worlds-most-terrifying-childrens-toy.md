<p>There&apos;s a new action figure coming to toy store shelves which will immortalize the singer in plastic... just what children nationwide have always hoped for! Seriously, what is this thing doing at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004150/http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=10999954">Toys R Us</a>? And <em>whygodwhy</em> did the toy manufacturers give us the 63-year-old Iggy over the youthful 20-something Iggy who started strutting his stuff on stage with The Stooges in the &apos;60s?</p>

<p>The man has been going full force even in his older age, so we&apos;ll just assume this is an homage to his endurance. Either way, you can now pre-order on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110420004150/http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=10999954">Toys R Us</a> for just $14.99 (free shipping!).
