<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408232947/http://gothamist.com/tags/whitstillman">Whit Stillman</a>&apos;s debut film, <em>Metropolitan</em> was released on August 3rd, 1990, and it&apos;s aged so very well over the past 22 years, hasn&apos;t it? On August 28th at Nitehawk Cinema we&apos;ll be revisiting the &quot;urban haute bourgeoisie&quot; of Manhattan&apos;s upper regions, and you&apos;re invited. Stillman and Chris Eigeman will be on hand for a Q&amp;A; after the screening (Lena Dunham, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408232947/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/wtf_happened_at_that_lena_dunham_wh.php">you are welcome to come moderate</a>), and an afterparty where we&apos;ll have one cocktail (TBD!) pouring freely for the evening.</p>

<p>Tickets are now on sale, and are sure to sell out faster than you can say &quot;Fourierism,&quot; as this is a rarely screened film&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408232947/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/movie.php?movie=272">buy yours here</a> for a modest $13 (this includes the aforementioned bougie beverage).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This event sold out in two hours! There are no longer tickets available.</p>
