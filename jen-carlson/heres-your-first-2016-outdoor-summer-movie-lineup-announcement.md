---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="tgunintrep16.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132422im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/tgunintrep16.jpg" width="640" height="380" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It may still feel far off, but be warmed by the fact that it&apos;s nearly outdoor summer movie season&#x2014;even though it means you&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132422/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/watch_the_bryant_park_movie_lawn_ru.php">packing into public spaces</a> with hordes of other New Yorkers even though <em>you can just watch that movie at home in peace</em> (and air conditioning). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132422/http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/summer-movie-series.aspx">The Intrepid Summer Movie Series</a> is a nice option, and arguably the most unique of the outdoor summer movie venues. Today they announced their lineup, which kicks off with <em>Top Gun</em>... again. Though maybe they&apos;ll have a volleyball expert on hand this time around? &quot;Each film will be introduced by a special guest speaker who can provide unique insight into that evening&#x2019;s selection,&quot; according to the press release. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s what else you&apos;ll be able to see (for free!) on the historic aircraft carrier&apos;s huge inflatable screen this year:</p>

<p>Friday, May 27th: <em>Top Gun</em><br>
Thursday, July 7th: <em>Star Trek</em> (2009)<br>
Thursday, July 14th: <em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</em><br>
Thursday, July 21st: <em>Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan</em><br>
Friday, July 29th: <em>Galaxy Quest</em><br>
Friday, August 5th: <em>Iron Giant</em></p>

<p>Since there&apos;s no grass on the flight deck, members of the public are invited to bring lawn chairs and blankets (and picnic baskets!). </p>
