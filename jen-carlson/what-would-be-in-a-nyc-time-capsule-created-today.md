<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926230813/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/23/75_years_ago_today_a_time_capsule_w.php">we revisited the time capsule</a> that was buried 50-feet underground in Queens during the 1939 World&apos;s Fair&#x2014;it won&apos;t be dug up again for over 4,000 more years. Since we won&apos;t get the satisfaction of seeing that one unearthed, we started thinking about what would be in a NYC-centric time capsule made today (let&apos;s say 2000 - present day)&#x2014;what would we like future generations to know about the five boroughs as it is now? We have some suggestions...</p>
