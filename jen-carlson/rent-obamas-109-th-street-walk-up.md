</div></div>					<p>When Barack Obama moved out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063252/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/recollections-of-obamas-ex-roommate/">his apartment</a> on 109th Street decades ago, he noted in his memoir that he fled &quot;due to lack of heat.&#x201D; Now Apartment 3E at 142 West 109th Street is back on the market, and the going rate is $1850/month (if you can&apos;t afford that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063252/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/27/obama_alley.php">the nearby alley</a> he slept in is probably <em>a lot</em> cheaper).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063252/http://westsideindependent.com/2010/06/08/rent-barack-obamas-old-uws-apartment-for-1900/">West Side Independent</a>, the two-bedroom is on the third-floor of a walk-up and it includes a windowless office (no distractions!), a tiny kitchen, exposed brick walls, wood floors, and a marble bathroom. Plus, they point out, that the neighborhood is a lot safer since the President lived there. Of course, the big selling point is that the President <em>did</em> live there.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063252/http://www.citi-habitats.com/viewlisting.php?adID=426298&amp;scroll=1">The listing reads</a>: &quot;PRESIDENT OBAMA LIVED HERE AND YOU CAN TOO! Central Park! Yes just few steps from central Park is this great two bedrooms for only $1850. The unit features hardwood floors, exposed brick, nice marble bathroom, high ceilings, big windows.&quot; And if you make the plunge, you too will be able to declare to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063252/http://www.observer.com/2009/real-estate/obama-slept-here">the Observer</a>, as the old tenant once did, &quot;I had sex in Obama&apos;s old bedroom!&quot; Yep, that could be you, fellow American.</p>
