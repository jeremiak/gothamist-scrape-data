First a warning: stop reading this if the show is still on your DVR, unwatched.</p>

<p>In last night&apos;s season finale, Jack (in a flash forward/alternate universe/through the looking glass scene) sees an obituary in the newspaper and goes to a funeral home (stating he isn&apos;t family or a friend of the deceased). According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707021030/http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Through_the_Looking_Glass">Lostpedia</a>, the obituary Jack was reading said: &quot;The body of Jo.. [unreadable] ..antham of New York was.. [unreadable] ..[shortly after 4 a.m. by the.. [unreadable] of Grand Avenue.&quot;</p>

<p><strike>Could it be that the man in the coffin is John Locke, and if so - what was alternate universe Locke doing on Grand Avenue at 4am?</strike> UPDATE: The newspaper reads: &quot;The body of John Lantham of New York was found shortly after 4 am in the 4300 block of Grand Avenue. Ted Worden, a doorman at the Tower Lofts complex, heard loud noises coming from the victim&#x2019;s loft. Concerned for tenants&#x2019; safety, he entered the loft and found the body hanging from a beam in the living room. According to Jaime Ortiz, a police spokesman, the incident was deemed a suicide after medical tests. Latham (sic) is survived by one teenaged son. Memorial services will be held at the Hoffs-Drawlar Funeral Home tomorrow evening.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707021030/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/05/so_ben_whats_gonna_happen_on_l.html">NY Mag</a> has an interview with everyone&apos;s favorite island villain, Ben. In real life, he lives on <em>this</em> island: </p><blockquote><em>Have you bought a house in Hawaii yet?</em><br>
Oh, no, I would never do that. My gypsy instincts always tell me that, you know, the next episode could be the last. Home is still New York City.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Seems like a lot of the <em>Lost</em> cast are in town, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707021030/http://gawker.com/stalker/">Gawker Stalker</a> had two sightings this week: </p><blockquote>Michael Emerson @ E 6th St, May 21st, 7pm<br>
&quot;Walking alone in East Village. Looks EXACTLY the same, right down to the steely stare. I think I&apos;m next. Was too scared to ask what happened to Locke.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Dominic Monaghan @ W Broadway &amp; Broome St, May 23rd, 3pm<br>
&quot;Saw Dominic Monaghan and his parents on Broome and West Broadway. I didn&apos;t get any spoilers.&quot;</p></blockquote>Most of the cast were in town for the TV upfronts last week, but Matthew Fox had another reason:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170707021030/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/05/15/tv_star_matthew.php">Giving the Class Day speech</a> to Columbia graduates.  <p></p>
