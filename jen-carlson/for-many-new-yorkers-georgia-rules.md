Or rather, Atlanta. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020347/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12222008/news/regionalnews/the_living_is_easy_after_leaving_ny_145365.htm">The NY Post</a> has the latest on the exodus, zeroing in on a family who live on an &quot;above average&quot; income but were still only able to live on Long Island while here...with one of their parents. &quot;But when the family moved to Atlanta, Merritt and his wife found they were living far better on about the same income,&quot; saying &quot;<strong>We went from struggling to having a great quality of life in just a few weeks</strong>.&quot; Real estate is, of course, a main factor here, with a 4-bedroom home going for around $275K in an Atlanta suburb, and property taxes about a 1/4 of what they would be in New York. So maybe the Real Housewives of Atlanta aren&apos;t <em>really</em> that rich after all? The paper also reminds that &quot;between 2000 and 2005, 40,000 New Yorkers moved to Atlanta, according to the city&apos;s Regional Commission.&quot;</p>
