<p>One of NYC&apos;s skateboarding legends, Andy Kessler, died yesterday in Montauk at the age of 49. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324160138/http://www.skatedaily.net/news/archive/2009/08/09-15.php#n004725">Initial reports</a> are stating that the cause of death was an allergic reaction to a hornet sting. In 2005, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324160138/http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/sports/features/11956/"><em>New York</em> magazine</a> profiled the skater and the Zoo York tribe he was a part of, just as the West Coast skaters were getting all the attention on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324160138/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355702/">the big screen</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324160138/http://www.boingboing.net/2009/08/11/nyc-skateboarding-le.html">BoingBoing</a> has a quote about Kessler from Glen E. Friedman, a photographer who chronicled skate culture, saying, &quot;If skateboarding was a town, this guy was its mayor. Andy Kessler, one of the good ones... This was a great dude, NO ONE could say anything wrong about this dude. He was one of the oldest, if not <em>the</em> oldest, skater in New York City, holding it down, real since the 70&apos;s. Andy will be seriously missed by many including myself.&quot; This type of sentiment is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324160138/http://www.skatedaily.net/news/archive/2009/08/09-15.php#n004727">a familiar one</a> amongst those who knew him. And you can get to know him and his skating here: </p>
