<p>Today marks the 29th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190434/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/06/lennon_1.php">anniversary of John Lennon&apos;s death</a>. The musician would have just turned 69 this October had Mark David Chapman not shot him dead outside of the Dakota on the night of December 8th, 1980. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190434/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/19/lennons_killer.php">Last year</a> Chapman was denied parole for a 5th time.) To commemorate Lennon&apos;s life and death, fans will gather once again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190434/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/08/lennon_2.php">at Strawberry Fields</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116190434/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/devotee-of-lennon-haunts-strawberry-fields/">CityRoom</a> spoke to the unofficial curator of the Imagine mosaic there).
