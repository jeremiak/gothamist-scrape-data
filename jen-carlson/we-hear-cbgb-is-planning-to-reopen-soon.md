<p>So, about that whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308120506/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/24/how_many_times_can_we_say_goodbye_t.php">CBGBs is dead</a> thing? It may be coming back, and soon. We have it on good authority that the legendary venue is still alive in spirit, and angling to take over a new space in Manhattan. With the contents of the original club still around in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308120506/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/25/cbgb.php">a basement somewhere</a>, if all goes according to plan it will even look like the old space. We&apos;ll update when we have more information, which should be filtering in over the next few weeks. </p>

<p>Do you think the legendary club can be a success without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308120506/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/29/checking_in_wit.php">Hilly Kristal</a>? Or without bands like this?</p>
