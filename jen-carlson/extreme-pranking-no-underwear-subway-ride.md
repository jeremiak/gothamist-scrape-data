</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521073751/http://gothamist.com/tags/nopantsride">No Pants Subway Ride</a> is for pussies (no pun intended)... the <em>real</em> Improv Everywhere enthusiasts are all about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521073751/http://improveverywhere.com/2010/04/01/no-underwear-subway-ride/">No <em>Underwear</em> Subway Ride</a>. Head exhibitionist Charlie Todd says for their latest mission &quot;over 1,000 people rode the subway without underwear or pants... we decided it was time to up the ante. Riders spread out over four different subway lines to surprise and delight everyday New Yorkers riding the train.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, it <em>is</em> April Fool&apos;s Day, so we have to assume the troupe were <em>really</em> all decked out in nude-colored underwear. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521073751/http://www.flickr.com/photos/katesokoler/sets/72157623620881823/">More photos here</a> for your scrutiny.</p>
