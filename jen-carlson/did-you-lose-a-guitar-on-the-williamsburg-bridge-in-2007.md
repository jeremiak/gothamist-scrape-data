<p>This week a do-gooder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161619/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/muc/3086910846.html">took to Craigslist</a> with a story of a lost guitar that he found <em>five years ago</em>. He refers to himself as a &quot;Hashavas Aveida,&quot; or someone who finds a lost item and safeguards it until the owner claims it. In other words, a guardian. In other words, here is One Craigslist Post That Will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161619/http://www.slate.com/slideshows/news_and_politics/amazing-photos-of-broccoli-the-health-care-star.html">Restore Your Faith</a> In Humanity. He writes:</p><blockquote>&quot;If you lost your Gibson, or know anyone who did&#x2014;please contact me bc I WANT TO RETURN THE INSTRUMENT TO IT&apos;S RIGHTFUL OWNER. Well after midnight on a summer night of June 2007&#x2014;a guitar fell out of the back window of a SUV that was headed toward the Williamsburg bridge. No one returned to retrieve it. I posted lost and found signs, asked the local bars if anyone called to say they lost their instrument, and contacted the bands whose stickers were on the guitar case. No luck. I&apos;ve moved twice since and set it in the back of my closet. I am hoping to find it&apos;s rightful owner.&quot; </blockquote>We contacted the poster to see if he&apos;s had any luck since putting up his latest effort on Wednesday, and will follow this story until that guitar finds its way back to the musician who obviously didn&apos;t care that much about it in the first place!
