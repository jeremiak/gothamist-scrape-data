<p>La Croix (pronounced La-CROY, like &quot;enjoy&quot;) is a drink that&apos;s been around since 1981. Founded in Wisconsin, it saw a national spike in popularity around 1990 when a bunch of Perrier was recalled. Sometime around 2014 it became A Thing in New York City, and now people from the Midwest will brag that they&apos;ve been drinking it for years. And we&apos;ll give that to them, they have so little out there. But now is La Croix&apos;s time to shine in a real city&#x2014;if it can make it here, it can make it anywhere. </p>

<p>La Croix&#x2014;which is a sparking water (and therefore has less bubble intensity than seltzer) currently comes in 20 flavors, none of which has sweeteners or calories: pure (unflavored), berry, coconut, cran-raspberry, lemon, lime, orange, peach-pear, mango, passion fruit, apricot, tangerine, pamplemousse (grapefruit), pomme-bay&#xE1; (apple-berry), cerise lim&#xF3;n (cherry lime), pi&#xF1;a fraise (pineapple strawberry), mel&#xF3;n pomelo (grapefruit melon), kiwi sand&#xED;a (kiwi watermelon), mur&#xE9; pepino (blackberry cucumber), and LaCola.</p>

<p>The flavors are a thing of passion amongst La Croix drinkers, but New Yorkers do have an overall favorite. Let&apos;s go back to that wall of La Croix in Williamsburg, which is by far the largest in NYC. Michael Sinatra, a rep for Whole Foods&apos; Northeast region, tells us that customers here prefer pamplemousse (also known as grapefruit, or simply PAMP). </p>

<p>&quot;Our customers most favorite flavor to date is Grapefruit, selling out other flavors as much as 6 times over,&quot; he told us this week. &quot;It&apos;s the favorite flavor is general, but New York City specific.&quot; He added that the La Croix &quot;has been a very popular item among our shoppers lately... the Williamsburg team (as well as our other NYC stores) orders La Croix 6 days a week The items get stocked up each night.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently it&apos;s on sale for $2 for 8, Sinatra adds, so it&apos;s been extra popular with the price slashed. </p>

<p>How long will PAMP stay on top? &quot;New flavors are always being added as La Croix develops them,&quot; we&apos;re told, and &quot;in early 2016, we added Tangerine and it&#x2019;s steadily becoming a top seller.&quot;</p>
