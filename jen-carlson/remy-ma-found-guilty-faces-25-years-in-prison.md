This all occurred after the two, along with a large party, were enjoying a night at Pizza Bar in the Meatpacking District. </p>

<p>Since then she&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316213228/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/15/remy_ma_is_free.php">in and out of Rikers</a>, and has been slapped with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316213228/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/22/remy_ma_slapped.php">a $20 million lawsuit</a> by Barnes-Joseph...but her problems just got bigger. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316213228/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1584003/20080324/ma__remy.jhtml">Earlier this week</a> her attorney Ivan Fisher admitted in closing arguments that his client did shoot &quot;her friend&quot;...but it was an accident! The gun simply went off while the two women struggled for Barnes-Joseph&apos;s purse. An admission that goes against everything Remy Ma has stated since the incident occurred last summer. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316213228/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/03/27/2008-03-27_bad_girl_rapper_remy_ma_found_guilty_of_.html">The Daily News</a> reports that the jury has now spoken, and Remy Ma has been found guilty. She now faces up to 25 years in prison for first-degree assault and weapons charges. She was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs screaming, &quot;Oh my god!&quot; She is currently being held without bail until her April 23rd sentencing. </p>
