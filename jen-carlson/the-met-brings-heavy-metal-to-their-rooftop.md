<p>Every summer the Metropolitan Museum of Art transforms their rooftop into something new: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516181413/http://gothamist.com/tags/bambu">a bamboo forest</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516181413/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/jeff_koons_atop.php">cartoonish wonderland</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516181413/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/09/sol_lewitt_1929.php">colorful skyline</a>, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516181413/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/24/a_silver_tree_grows_in_manhattan.php">tree-climbing adventure</a> are some of the recent installations that have made it to the top floor. But this year the rooftop is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516181413/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/coming_to_the_mets_rooftop_this_sum.php">cold and British</a>! We hear if you stare at it for too long you risk a summer-long bout with seasonal affective disorder, so consider yourself warned.</p>

<p>Starting today, British artist Anthony Caro&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516181413/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId={F97033D2-802B-4A64-AC9C-EDE499383A05}">set of sculptures</a> are now on top of the museum through October 30th, whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>At a press conference yesterday Caro announced that he&apos;ll be bringing a sculpture to the Park Avenue median soon, as well&#x2014;replacing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150516181413/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/arts/design/16ryman.html">the pretty giant roses</a>.</p>
