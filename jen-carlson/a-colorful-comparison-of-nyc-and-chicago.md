</div></div>					<p>Here&apos;s a neat infographic comparing New York City and Chicago&#x2014;since we already know which city is better (sorry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211459/http://chicagoist.com/">Chicagoist</a>), this one simply compares the unique qualities of each. A few sections are above, and you can view the full illustration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211459/http://www.citypass.com/blog/chicago/chicago-and-new-york-whats-the-difference/">right here</a>. Basically, we have more tourists, more mafia families, we&apos;re the most expensive city to live in, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211459/http://www.answerbag.com/polls/city-pizza-chicago-york-city_2213249">our pizza is subpar</a>. Hmm, we&apos;re beginning to think someone in Chicago was behind this thing...</p>
