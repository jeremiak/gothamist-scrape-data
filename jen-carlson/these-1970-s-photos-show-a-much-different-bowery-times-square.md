Bobb&#xE9;, who was a cab driver and musician back in the day, told us about his habit of shooting the streets back then:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;During the mid-1970&apos;s I lived below Chinatown in what used to be the Fulton Fish Market. I used to ride my bicycle up The Bowery and although at the time photography was just a hobby for me I began to shoot what I saw on the streets. Besides The Bowery I also was fascinated with the old Times Square which was filled with hookers and pimps hanging out in broad daylight. I was driving a cab at this time in support of my first career which was a rock&apos;n roll musician, so I had direct access to many different neighborhoods. Whenever I went out I had a camera with me so i was always prepared.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Please feel free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104846/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">to share</a> your own photos from another era of NYC with us!</p>
