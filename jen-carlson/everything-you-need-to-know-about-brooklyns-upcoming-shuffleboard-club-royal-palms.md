<p>As you may know by now, we&apos;re pretty excited about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531070910/http://gothamist.com/tags/shuffleboard">shuffleboard</a> around here, and soon after we declared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531070910/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/why_arent_there_any_real_shuffleboa.php">our love of the game</a>, we were given the scoop that a genuine shuffleboard club would be opening in Brooklyn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531070910/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/shuffleboard.php">next year</a>. At the time we withheld some information about the club until details got firmed up (and also because we didn&apos;t want our heart rate to get too high) but now we can pass along a whole lot more, including the name of your new favorite club: <em>The Royal Palms.</em> And here is more <em>exclusive info</em> direct from co-founder Jonathan Schnapp:</p>

<blockquote>The Royal Palms is the world&apos;s first shuffleboard night club. Sipping a frothy Key Lime Fizz, swaying to the back porch sounds from the house band; our visitor grabs his vintage shuffleboard biscuits and tangs and is instantly transported to the sexy, festive, sun-drenched world of 1970&#x2019;s Palm Beach.
 
<strong>Housed in a 1919 Printing Press in the burgeoning Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, The Royal Palms will boast 18 shuffleboard courts (12 full-size, regulation shuffleboard courts downstairs and another 6 courts in the proposed &#x201C;Lido Deck&#x201D; outdoor space upstairs) spread over 32,000 square feet</strong> of citrus drenched indoor and outdoor space. Even at full capacity it will offer visitors a leisurely year-round retreat rarely found in the dark, cramped venues of New York City.</blockquote> 
 
For food, they plan to have a constant rotation of high-profile food trucks and guest chefs to drive directly into the space and offer their artisanal specialties on a short-term basis. They&apos;re also working on specialty cocktails, including spiked snowcones, and plan to host bingo nights, live music (think 1950s barbershop quartets), and occasionally old episodes of <em>The Love Boat</em> will be broadcast on a big screen.
<p></p><p>
Right now they&apos;re still working out lease details, but tell us they&apos;re aiming at a &quot;modern leisure, vintage fun&quot; vibe to go along with their laid back 1970s Florida feel once they open next Spring. And when they <em>do</em> open, their court rental fees will be about half the price of bowling around these parts&#x2014;with fees ranging anywhere from $30 an hour per court on weekend evenings to $10 during daytime hours for seniors and children.

At press time, we&apos;re ordering lots of seersucker and pastels and mass-emailing our friends about starting a team, because there <em>will</em> be league nights.
