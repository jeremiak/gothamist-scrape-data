Yep, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617133808/http://improveverywhere.com/2010/07/14/star-wars-subway-car/">Improv Everywhere</a> has returned with a new piece in their Theater of Prank repertoire, saying, &quot;The white walls and sliding doors on the train reminded us of the rebel ship, and we thought it would be fun to see how people would react to a surprise appearance by the iconic characters.&quot; Check it out:</p>
