<p>As expected, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507104801/http://gothamist.com/tags/peta">PETA</a> and other animal activists turned up at the Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade earlier to protest the SeaWorld float, or more specifically, SeaWorld&apos;s confinement of whales. PETA&apos;s Colleen O&apos;Brien tells us that as they lined up to protest today, 12-year-old Rose McCoy &quot;jumped over the parade barricade while holding a sign reading &apos;Boycott SeaWorld,&apos; and protested alongside the float before being escorted back behind the barricade by authorities.&quot; You can see that in the video below:</p>

<p>McCoy says, &quot;SeaWorld takes baby orcas from their mothers and forces them to live in small concrete tanks, never knowing what it&apos;s like to spend time with family or swim long distances. I hope people who saw me at the parade will boycott SeaWorld until it stops tearing families apart and returns these animals to their ocean homes.&quot;</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507104801/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/more_macys_parade_animal_woes_peta.php">previously noted</a>, the renewed protests against SeaWorld come in the wake of documentary <em>Blackfish</em>, which digs into the amusement park&apos;s allegedly inhumane treatment of its whales. &quot;Keeping an orca in small concrete tank is like forcing a human to spend its entire life in bathtub. Macy&apos;s needs to catch up and realize including this float celebrates cruelty to animals in what is supposed to be family event. It ruins the parade,&quot; PETA spokesperson Ashley Byrne told us earlier this month.</p>
