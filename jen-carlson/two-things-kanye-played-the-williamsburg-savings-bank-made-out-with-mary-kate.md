<p>Last night Kanye West played <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024049/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/23/kanye_west_to_play_free_nyc_show_in.php">that &quot;secret&quot; free show</a>, which ended up being at the gorgeous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024049/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/23/williamsburgh_savings_bank.php">Williamsburg Savings Bank</a> in Brooklyn (the event was hosted by Heineken). Check out some video below, along with the new long-awaited video for his song &quot;Monster&quot; (seriously worth watching, in all its cannibalistic, beheaded, torture porn glory). But first, let&apos;s talk about the Kanye + MK gossip, which is that Kanye West, while in New York City celebrating his 34th birthday, hooked up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024049/http://perezhilton.com/2011-06-09-kanye-west-hooked-up-with-mary-kate-olsen-secret-show">with Mary-Kate Olson</a>. <em>Oh, Kanye</em>.</p>

<p>Allegedly the two were at Submercer in SoHo on Wednesday when this all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024049/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2011/06/09/kanye-west-mary-kate-olsen-new-couple-dating-hook-up/">went down</a>. There doesn&apos;t seem to be any photographic evidence, but you can see the world&apos;s most disturbing Photoshop portraying this story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024049/http://www.sohh.com/2011/06/kanye_west_likes_a_full_house_romantical.html">right here</a>.</p>

<p>As for last night&apos;s show, many of the attendees seemed to be VIPs, with Diddy, Estelle and Jay-Z all on the list... though rumor has it Jay-Z never showed (at least he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024049/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/kanye_west_garden_party.php">at MoMA&apos;s Garden Party</a>). Check out &quot;Runaway&quot; below, and you can see more photos and video from the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024049/http://www.islanddefjam.com/artist/news_single.aspx?nid=9509&amp;artistID=7307">here</a>.</p>
