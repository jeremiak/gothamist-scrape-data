<p>Following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128124148/http://gothamist.com/tags/whitneyhouston">Whitney Houston</a>&apos;s death <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128124148/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/11/whitney_houston_has_died_at_age_48.php">in February</a>, photos of her last meal were published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128124148/http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/13/whitney-houston-alcohol-hotel-room-drugs-alcohol-heineken-champagne-xanax/#.T5qWdcRWq-0">by TMZ</a>. A table had been set up in Houston&apos;s hotel room where she was served a hamburger, fries, a turkey sandwich and jalepenos, along with champagne and Heineken. She later took some of that food on a tray into the bathroom, to presumably finish the meal in the bathtub where she would later die. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128124148/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/arts/design/image-of-whitney-houstons-last-meal-at-matthew-marks.html">the NY Times</a> reports that this scene (which they describe as &quot;gruesome&quot;) from the Beverly Hilton Hotel has been recreated by photographer Thomas Demand.</p>

<p>Demand says, &quot;The proliferation of that kind of image at the time when she was not even in the coffin amazed me. It amazed me that it would ever have been released.&quot; So naturally, he felt the need to take it a step further. Artists! To recreate the scene, he headed to the Beverly Hilton and checked into a room with the same layout as the one Houston was staying in. He then ordered the same food. </p>

<p>His photograph of his recreated scene will be on display starting May 5th at the Matthew Marks Gallery (West 22nd Street in Chelsea). For now, a comparison of the scenes are above... seems like Demand got hungry and ate all the fries before taking his shot.</p>
