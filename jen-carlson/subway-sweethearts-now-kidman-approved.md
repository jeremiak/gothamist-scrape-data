What&apos;s new to report on the two-some since they are apparently, really, for real, turning off their spotlight now? </p>

<p>Well, not much. The two shared the B train to Brooklyn after appearing on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120311072714/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/09/best_of_luck_to.php">GMA yesterday</a> and got some underground recognition (one straphanger hollered, &quot;You are my favorite story this year.&quot;). Beating out an awww-struck ABC anchor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120311072714/http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=583088">Chris Cuomo</a> as their most famous fan however...is the one and only Nicole Kidman! We&apos;re betting aspiring-actress Camille made it a point to bump in to her in the ABC studios.</p><blockquote>Yesterday, even Nicole Kidman was swept up in the romantic fairy tale involving Hayton, 22, a fellow Aussie.<p></p>

<p>The actress crossed paths with the couple yesterday at GMA, and told The Post: &quot;It&apos;s just an amazing, amazing story, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p></blockquote>Apparently even Kidman will have to make up her own ending to the story, because Moberg says they&apos;re turning the cameras off now. We&apos;ve heard that one before.<p></p>
