</div></div>					<p>Remember in the 1987 classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509070629/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092718/"><em>Can&apos;t Buy Me Love</em></a> when Ronald Miller took Cindy Mancini to the airplane graveyard? Well we have our very own <em>sunken ship graveyard</em> right here in New York, which is way cooler. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509070629/http://tugster.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/graveyard-1/">Tugster</a> paddled out there on a kayak yesterday and returned with some amazing photos. In this old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509070629/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/nyregion/a-lesson-in-history-of-old-ships.html">NY Times</a> article, dating back 20 years, the paper takes a look at Staten Island&apos;s Rossville, where ships go to die. At the time, Norman Brouwer, curator of the South Street Seaport Museum, told them it &quot;is a tableau of the history of shipping in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>Back when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509070629/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/YOU%27D%20NEVER%20BELIEVE/rossville/rossville.html">Forgotten-NY</a> took a visit, he reported back noting that &quot;vessels from all decades of the 20th Century lie, not exactly in state, but in a state of decomposition and rust at this former boatyard at Arthur Kill Road and Rossville Avenue. Most are tugs or cargo ships. The former piers have collapsed and are for the most part unpassable, which makes them a magnet for daredevil urban explorers.&quot; Color us intrigued.</p>
