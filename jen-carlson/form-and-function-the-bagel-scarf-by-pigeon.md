<p>A reader spotted this pigeon bringin&apos; home the <strike>bacon</strike> bagel on Union Avenue near Metropolitan in Williamsburg yesterday. Whatever, like you <em>haven&apos;t</em> wanted to eat your way through a bagel in this fashion? And just look at that strut, total confidence. We salute you, Bagel Pigeon.</p>
