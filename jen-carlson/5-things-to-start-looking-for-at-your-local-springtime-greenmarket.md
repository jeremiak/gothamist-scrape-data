Last year we made \<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/LYTwK2vYdX/\"\>a rhubarb chutney\<\/a\> that went perfectly with a fresh baked loaf of bread and thin shavings of parmesan.

Ramps are so good that they go well WITH EVERYTHING. Sautee them and eat them with your hands, like an animal. Cook them up with some pasta. \<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/cooking_with_ramps_pasta_cornbread.php\"\>Add them to cornbread\<\/a\>. But whatever you do, you better save some for some ramps pesto.
