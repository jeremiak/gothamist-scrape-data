<span class="photo_caption">Pro tip, guys: always include a cat in your YouTube</span></p>

<p>At press time this video only has 304 views, so let&apos;s help out these young stars in their search for internet fame (crossing over from the mainstream isn&apos;t always easy!). Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104091644/http://gothamist.com/tags/zooeydeschanel">Zooey Deschanel</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104091644/http://gothamist.com/tags/josephgordonlevitt">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a> singing &quot;What Are You Doing New Years Eve?&quot; (And before you ask, this is relevant because a new study just came out that proved it is scientifically impossible to harbor even one ounce of hatred towards either of these two.)</p>

<p>On her website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104091644/http://hellogiggles.com/video-chat-karaoke-special-zooey-deschanel-joe-gordon-levitt-what-are-you-doing-new-years-eve-nancy-wilson">HelloGiggles</a>, Zooey explains:</p><blockquote>&quot;I have known Joe Gordon-Levitt for going on 12 years.  We first met in the summer of 2000 while doing a tiny movie called <em>Manic</em>, where we bonded over a mutual appreciation for Harry Nilsson and Nina Simone and I have been lucky enough to call him one of my dearest friends ever since.  When we did <em>500 Days of Summer</em> 8 years later, we spent every lunch hour dancing to Marvin Gaye in the hair and make up trailer; we had loads of fun. I hope to do a thousand more movies with him because he&#x2019;s simply the best. But in the meantime, we made a little New Year&#x2019;s duet for all of you! The original by Nancy Wilson.&quot;</blockquote>Anyway, what <em>are</em> you doing on New Year&apos;s Eve?<p></p>
