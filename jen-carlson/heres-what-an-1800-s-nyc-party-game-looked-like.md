					<p>By the end of the 19th century, New York City (which was made up of five boroughs as of 1898) was bustling&#x2014;department stores created shopping hubs Uptown, new technology allowed for the emergence of skyscrapers, and the Brooklyn Bridge was built. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061342/https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/new-york-in-the-1880s/">Dandies</a> walked the (trash-filled) streets in their waistcoats and violet spats. The Statue of Liberty arrived, and so did new residents and tourists. Peter Coddle was one of them.</p>

<p>The fictional character represented those dreaming of coming to NYC, and he&apos;s the protagonist of a circa-1880 party game called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061342/https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15566/account-peter-coddles-visit-new-york">Peter Coddle&apos;s Trip To New York</a>. The word game is simple, and like a group session of Mad Libs. One player reads the story, which has blank spaces throughout&#x2014;when those come up, a player draws a card and reads the phrase on it. Hilarity ensues.</p>

<p>The story begins with an introduction to Peter, who lives in an off-the-map farm town and &quot;all his life long he had looked forward to making a trip to New York, and when the opportunity came, he was not long in deciding to go.&quot; Here&apos;s a little taste: </p>

<blockquote>Well, we walked along with the crowd, who were hurryin&apos; to get _______ or to catch _______ until we got out into the street. And geewhittaker, I never did see the beat of such sights before. Right in front of me was _______ running right through _______ and over on one side of the street was _______ selling _______ to _______ and then there was _______ running on two rails in the middle of the street and all the queerest sights anyone could imagine.</blockquote>

<p>The cards include phrases that one may even relate to modern times, like tandem bicycle, squash pie, a dilapidated umbrella, a mud puddle, bunch of asparagus, piece of cheese, and pint of cider. Other more dated phrases include: a bottle of mucilage, a laughing hornpout, and cigar store Indian. </p>

<p>We picked up a copy of the game after seeing a piece on <a href="www.atlasobscura.com/articles/1880s-party-starters-had-their-own-version-of-cards-against-humanity">Atlas Obscura</a>, where they quoted the Cards Against Humanity co-creator as saying, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s basically an 1800s Cards Against Humanity.&quot; But after getting our hands on it, that seems inaccurate... it&apos;s definitely Mad Libs. Now, we&apos;ve got to go and wash this dysentery off...</p>
