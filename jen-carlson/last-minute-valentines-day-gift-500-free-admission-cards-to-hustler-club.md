<p>Hey ladies, looking for that perfect gift for your man for Valentine&apos;s Day? Single men, want to lose yourself in a night of manufactured caresses? Head over to Craigslist where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210061756/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/zip/2842577639.html">one poster</a> has fallen into a treasure trove of free admittance cards to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210061756/http://www.hustlerny.com/">the Hustler Club</a> in Manhattan. They claim the cards are &quot;left over from an event,&quot; and have no expiration date. There are around 500, which means, if you see about five naked ladies upon each visit (is that accurate? We haven&apos;t been), you&apos;ll be seeing approximately 5,000 boobs once you work your way through the pile. Or something. Math! But you&apos;ll see a lot of naked lady parts. Just stay away from those private lap dances, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210061756/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/man_suing_strip_club_after_90_minut.php">they really add up</a>.</p>

<p>Did we mention this is FREE? This person really missed an opportunity to make some cash.</p>
