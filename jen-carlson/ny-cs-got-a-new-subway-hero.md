										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="subhero1110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714150539im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/subhero1110.jpg" width="350" height="393" class="image-left"> </span>The digital <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714150539/http://gothamist.com/tags/countdownclock">countdown clocks</a> in the subway stations served a new purpose yesterday, when 36-year-old Carlos Flores used one to check how much time he had to save a man who had fallen on to the tracks. Happy Monday everyone, we have a new subway hero! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714150539/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/29/2010-11-29_brave_local_man_makes_it_to_work_on_time__after_heroically_saving_man_sprawled_o.html">the Daily News</a>, Flores was waiting for the downtown 6 train at 103rd Street at 8 a.m. yesterday when he saw a man (who allegedly fainted) sprawled over the tracks. He told the paper, &quot;I was thinking, if he gets hit I can&apos;t go to work. It&apos;s Sunday. I can&apos;t miss out. It&apos;s a time-and-a-half day.&quot; (His job at a NoHo grocery store, where he&apos;s a produce clerk, gets him 19 bucks an hour on Sundays.)</p>

<p>Flores said the countdown clock said the next train would be arriving in 3 minutes, which he thought would be plenty of time&#x2014;but after getting the 220-pound man off the tracks, he nearly didn&apos;t have enough time to save himself. He said he could see the lights and hear the train braking as it was approaching the station, luckily another straphanger did a good deed by alerting the station agent of the situation, who gave the train conductor a heads up.</p>

<p>An NYC Transit rep says that following Flores&apos;s lead isn&apos;t recommended, and that they &quot;discourage anyone from jumping to the roadbed.&quot; But doing nothing never got anyone front page coverage.</p>
