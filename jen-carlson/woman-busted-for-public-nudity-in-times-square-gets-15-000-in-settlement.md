At the time she was being painted by body painter Andy Golub, and towards the end the 21-year-old went fully nude for the final touches. That&apos;s when, in front of spectators at 44th and Broadway, the NYPD arrested her, and brought her into the precinct fully nude. They later dropped all charges. <p></p>

<p>We know that women going topless in New York City is legal, but as far as the full monty goes, New York State Law states that public nudity is prohibited, &quot;except if it&apos;s part of a play, performance, exhibition or show,&quot; which clearly this was. And now West is walking away from the incident with $15,000 from her false-arrest lawsuit.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710064101/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/naked_gal_gets_deal_on_suit_rzU3DNFTdMhSYMMe1bAMVO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">the NY Post</a>, she &quot;plans to settle her false-arrest lawsuit today after getting a signed offer last week.&quot; The suit stated that NYPD Sgt. Anthony Fusaro was &#x201C;visibly unnerved&#x201D; when he approached West last summer, and told her he had to bring her in. Once at the Midtown South precinct, &quot;several cops &apos;gawked at her&apos; for 15 minutes before she was allowed to dress.&quot; </p>

<p>West&apos;s lawyer Ron Kuby did not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710064101/http://instantrimshot.com/">have a rimshot</a> available when he declared: &#x201C;The beauty of New York City is a naked girl can win a nice suit.&quot; He added, &#x201C;Given the police idiocy, one wonders where the boobs really are.&quot; He&apos;ll be here all week, ladies and germs, try the steak.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s some video from the scene last summer:</p>
