title: The Inevitable $90 Sexy Pizza Rat Costume Has Arrived
---

	
										<p>Someone didn&apos;t just make a Pizza Rat costume, someone made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030204935/http://www.yandy.com/Pizza-Rat-Costume.php">a <em>Sexy</em> Pizza Rat costume</a>, which features &quot;a soft, body-hugging grey mini dress.&quot; The costume was created right here in the United States of Idiocracy, and will cost $89.95 + shipping. Though it should be noted that for that price you will also get a &quot;free panty.&quot; This is absolutely not what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030204935/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">#PizzaRat</a> stood for. This costume has not only stripped #PizzaRat of his dignity, but of his metaphorical meaning.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="pizzarat15.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030204935im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/pizzarat15.jpg" width="640" height="428" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>As you can see, absolutely no thought has been put into this Sexy Pizza Rat costume, which inaccurately features &quot;adorable MOUSE ears,&quot; <em>two</em> slices of pepperoni, and zero tears of the many editors forced to generate several &quot;articles&quot; about a rat who once tried to eat discarded food in New York City. It&apos;s been weeks since #PizzaRat peaked, so there&apos;s been plenty of time to get this right, purveyor of sexy halloween costumes.</p>

<p>Instead of shelling out money for the above piece of garbage, we recommend buying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030204935/http://greatideas.people.com/2015/10/01/pizza-pouch-necklace-stupidiotic/">this pizza pouch</a>, placing a live rat inside along with a slice, strapping it around your neck for the night, and eventually falling drunk down the subway stairs. Like a real goddamn New Yorker. Like #PizzaRat.
