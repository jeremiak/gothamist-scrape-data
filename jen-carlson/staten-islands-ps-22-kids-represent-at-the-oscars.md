<p>At 11:38 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155847/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/27/the_83rd_annual_academy_awards_happ.php">last night</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155847/http://gothamist.com/tags/ps22">PS 22 kids</a> from Staten Island were introduced to Hollywood&apos;s biggest names by Oscar co-hosts James Franco and Anne Hathaway. The 64 fifth graders ended the big show with a rendition of &quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow,&quot; led by their chorus director Gregg &quot;Mr. B&quot; Breinberg. They were joined by the Oscar winners at the end... which may have made their t-shirts look even more out of place, but we&apos;re glad they kept it real in front of an A-list crowd.</p>

<p>10-year-old Azaria Chamorro told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155847/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/28/2011-02-28_highfives_as_si_kids_choir_does_city_proud.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+nydnrss/ny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">the Daily News</a> she got to hold a (very heavy) Oscar, and described the afterglow of the performance, saying, &quot;Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, it was really crazy. When we ended on the final note, I started jumping up and down and crying. I cried for a long, long time I was so happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Even the typically grumpy Nikki Finke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155847/http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/nikkis-5th-annual-oscars-live-snarking/">at Deadline</a> was won over, writing, &quot;Cue the finale: the 5th grade student choir from New York City/Staten Island School PS 22 closing the show by singing &apos;Over the Rainbow&apos; from The Wizard Of Oz ... A lovely end to the worst snorecast ever.&quot;</p>

<p>One teacher told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155847/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2011/02/staten_islands_ps_22_chorus_pe.html">Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;When we look a these kids, you have to understand the background. Many of them have never been on an airplane, never been to a hotel. Many of them, their parents work. They go home, their homes are empty. They have no one to help them with their schoolwork.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s no update on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110310155847/http://ps22chorus.blogspot.com/">their blog</a> yet, but they&apos;re probably getting some rest before another big appearance... on Oprah&apos;s Oscar special today!</p>
