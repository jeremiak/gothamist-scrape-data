title: How To Enhance Your Home's Hygge
---

	
										<p><em>Hygge (pronounced &#x201C;HUE-gah&#x201D;) is &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.skagen.com/gb/en/journal/danish-happiness-hygge/how-denmark-inspires/hygge-word-meaning.html">the Danish ritual</a> of enjoying life&#x2019;s simple pleasures. Friends. Family. Graciousness. Contentment. Good feelings. A warm glow. Cozy.&quot;</em></p>

<p>There are many loose definitions, but the term &quot;hygge&quot; was best described in that <em>New Yorker</em> article. No, not the one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1957/05/18/letter-from-copenhagen-2">from 1957</a>, where we find out about &quot;the force opposing Hygge called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skadefryd">skadefryd</a>.&quot; And not even in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-of-hygge-the-danish-obsession-with-getting-cozy">the one from 2016</a>, which declared &quot;this concept of Scandinavian coziness [had] made inroads with an international audience.&quot; No, we&apos;re talking about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/13/is-this-hygge">the one from 2017</a>, which dared to ask: Is this hygge?</p>

<p>It&apos;s a hard question to answer, because hygge is basically just the idea of being cozy and warm? But here&apos;s a cheat sheet: is it sheepskin, knit, a wall hanging, on fire, or macrame? It&apos;s probably hygge. At least, it&apos;s how to make your home look like someone&apos;s home who understands hygge, if any such person exists.</p>

<p><strong>KNIT:</strong> Do you know what is very expensive but also <em>very hygge</em>? Anything that is of the &quot;giant knit&quot; variety. Those giant knit blankets will cost you if you want one that&apos;s large enough to cover more than your shins&#x2014;you can find a lot of nice ones on Etsy though. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/289310937/chunky-knit-throw-chunky-wool-blanket">This one has</a> a more unique pattern than most, and will cost you $395+. A shop called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/shop/Woolaty">Woolaty</a> also has a number of large knit items, including this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/273067010/sale-super-chunky-scarf-knitted-scarf">super chunky knit scarf</a> for just $36.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpmfg3WkAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpmfg3WkAM.jpg" width="640" height="506" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">(via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/263685445/large-macrame-wall-hanging-macrame-wall">Etsy</a>)</span></p>

<p><strong>WALL HANGINGS:</strong> Woven wall hangings are very hygge, but be warned: there are good ones (look for a thick puffy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C2D42Q/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_49">roving wool</a> detail and maybe a tree branch) and there are bad ones (a bunch of strands of yarn hanging off a stick). Etsy has a ton, and you&apos;ll need to shell out a little more for quality&#x2014;there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/492545465/new-listing-woven-wall-hanging-item">this $500+ splurge </a>, but you&apos;ll be able to find some in the $100 range, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/249375272/woven-wall-hanging-handmade-tapestry-mid">like this one</a>. Macrame wall hangings, like above, are also plentiful&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/263685445/large-macrame-wall-hanging-macrame-wall">here&apos;s a large one for $399</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CANDLES:</strong> Dim lighting and flickering candles greatly enhance the hygge vibe during long winter nights. These votive candle holders from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.glassybaby.com/votives">Glassybaby</a> ($44) are ideal; dropping a small candle inside turns them into glowing orbs. Who needs a crackling fire when you&apos;ve got a few of these colored stars illuminating your February hygge hut? (Though if you do have a crackling fireplace, that works too&#x2014;can we be hygge buddies?) If you want some olfactory hygge, these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.hawkinsnewyork.com/products/hawkins-scent-collection">soy wax scented candles</a> are the thing, &quot;smoky and sweet, reminiscent of a walk down residential Union Street, with the first fires of fall and smoke curling from brick chimneys.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>MACRAME:</strong> You&apos;ll also need a macrame plant hanger, like your parents had in the &apos;70s. Again, you&apos;ll find a ton of Etsy (and you could easily make your own), but eBay has some perfectly serviceable ones for much less. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR9.TRC2.A0.H0.Xmacrame+plant+hanger.TRS0&amp;_nkw=macrame+plant+hanger&amp;_sacat=0">Check them out here</a>. Or you can loosen the pursestrings and go the extra hygge by getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/491647770/handmade-macrame-wall-planter-100-cotto">one of these</a>, which feature a real stick.</p>

<p><strong>SHEEPSKIN:</strong> There&apos;s a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.amazon.com/HSA/pages/default?pageId=A922EB41-4744-410B-B1BD-6F8A7DE026E4">real sheepskin</a> out there, but the faux sheepskin stuff looks just as good. I purchased <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.amazon.com/Yukon-International-SD-90-Ivoy-Sheepskin">this one</a> years ago and it still looks great draped over my super cheap desk chair. (Various sizes, prices.)</p>

<p>Those are your basic hygges&#x2014;now, here&apos;s how to take your hygge to the next level. Oh yeah.</p>

<span class="photo_caption">Hygge forest, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.onekingslane.com/p/995933-kevin-russ-sunrise-forest">OneKingsLane</a></span></p>

<p><strong>NATURE:</strong> Sweet, serene nature. This photograph is called &quot;Sunrise Forest,&quot; and it&apos;s been blown up just enough that you can stare at it and feel like you are in your own little, cozy forest. Goddamn Kevin Russ, you&apos;re the Bob Ross of HYGGE. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.onekingslane.com/p/995933-kevin-russ-sunrise-forest">$189 - $289</a>)</p>

<p><strong>FAT LAVA:</strong> Where are you going to put those flowers your boyfriend got you for National Hygge Day? (You better believe a marketing company is creating that fake holiday right now.) You&apos;ll want to get yourself what is called a fat lava vase. These were all around my German household when I was younger, and I have a few now that I&apos;ve purchased on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/search?q=fat%20lava%20vase">Etsy</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xfat+lava.TRS0&amp;_nkw=fat+lava&amp;_sacat=0">eBay</a>. They tend to be fairly inexpensive, but the shipping is where it will add up&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/496287711/vintage-w-germany-scheurich-fat-lava">here&apos;s a nice smaller one</a> for just $35 total, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/503287143/vintage-fat-lava-vase-u-keramik">one pictured below</a> will total out at under $70. You may find some slightly better deals on eBay&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://www.ebay.com/itm/Retro-Vintage-60-70s-SCHEURICH-414-16-Vase-West-German-Pottery-Fat-Lava-Era-/222380274837?hash=item33c6e5b495:g:ZfEAAOSw5cNYdA2v">here&apos;s a nice fat lava jug vase</a> for $30 total.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hyggein17NEW.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hyggein17NEW.jpg" width="640" height="300" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><strong>WRAPS:</strong> Wraps and shawls are pretty much the hygge uniform&#x2014;above is Pendleton&apos;s knit blanket shawl (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.amazon.com/Pendleton-Womens-Blanket-Walkers-Oxford/dp/B00V8U86Q6/">a splurge at $169</a>, but they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/nps_guide_2017.php">very supportive of our National Parks</a> and I like them). For a less expensive option, check out Nordstrom, where you can get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/treasurebond-plaid-blanket-wrap/4351923">a blanket wrap for $69</a>. There&apos;s nothing more hygge than a blanket you can wear.</p>

<p><strong>LINEN:</strong> There is an Etsy shop that I love, and the lovely family that started it seems to embody hygge (just check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.instagram.com/linenbee/">their Instagram</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/shop/linenbees">Linen Bees</a> is run out of Latvia, and I can vouch for the high quality of their goods&#x2014;they sell dresses, tablecloths, blankets, loungeware... all made out of linen. I highly recommend them for all your hygge and non-hygge needs&#x2014;maybe start with this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516193743/https://www.etsy.com/listing/508441403/womens-pajamas-linen-sleepwear-linen">linen pajama set</a>.</p>
