                            <p>Early this morning as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802001202/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/russian_court_finds_pussy_riot_guil.php">the Pussy Riot verdict</a> was handed down in Russia (the women were sentenced to two years in prison for &quot;hooliganism&quot;), women, men and children around the world voiced their support at a series of protests and marches. And as we reported earlier, about an hour after New Yorkers began to gather near the Russian Consulate, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802001202/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/photos_pussy_riot_supporters_arrest.php#photo-1">began making arrests</a>. </p>

<p>At least three, and more likely <em>six</em> people were arrested&#x2014;we&apos;re waiting for the NYPD to confirm the official number, but one person on the scene says that 3 men and 3 women were arrested (of the around 40 people in attendance). These protesters did not remove their balaclavas when the NYPD demanded they remove their masks. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802001202/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/nypd_uses_law_from_1845_to_arrest_m.php#photo-1">we learned</a> after some OWS arrests last year, &quot;wearing masks is in violation of a law that bars two or more participants from doing so.&quot; The law dates back to 1845.</p>

<p>Photographer Alec Tabak was on the scene today as the remaining supporters made their way to Times Square, and reported back, &quot;A few dozen protestors entered Times Square... Just a few officers escorted them. They stayed out of the street, didn&apos;t jaywalk. Upon reaching the island between 44th and 45th, one protestor broke into a song in Russian; the Naked Cowboy joined in long enough for a photo op, then split.&quot;</p>
