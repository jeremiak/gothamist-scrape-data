<p>This Saturday you can hurl tomatoes at friends and strangers in Floyd Bennett Field <em>because New York is FINALLY getting its own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821154348/http://tomatobattle.com/">Tomato Battle</a>!</em> We were pretty jealous when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821154348/http://sfist.com/2011/09/06/massive_tomato_fight_heading_to_ple.php">San Francisco got one</a>, and kind of figured the fruit fight would never happen here since we can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821154348/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/pillow_fight_4.php"><em>barely</em> handle</a> a pillow fight. But... IT&apos;S ALL HAPPENING.</p>

<p>There is some bad news though: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821154348/http://tbnyc.eventbrite.com/">it costs $50</a> (or $25 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821154348/https://livingsocial.com/events/cities/3-nyc-midtown/638518-new-york-city-tomato-battle-admission">with this deal</a>) (+$10 if you need to use the shuttle to get there, which you probably do). But for that price you&apos;ll get the satisfying feeling of throwing mushy tomatoes at people (organizers promise &quot;thousands&quot; of targets, and presumably plenty of tomatoes), live music, food and beer (actually, those will cost you <em>more</em>), and a costume contest. Here&apos;s what you&apos;re in for: </p>
