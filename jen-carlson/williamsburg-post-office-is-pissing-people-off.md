title: Williamsburg Post Office Is Pissing People Off

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="1109postofficeugh.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429115810im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/1109postofficeugh.jpg" width="640" height="301" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>While some might claim the worst Post Office in Brooklyn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429115810/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/08/post_office.php">is in Park Slope</a>... the Williamsburg USPS worker bees are working the hardest they&apos;ve ever worked to steal that title away. The South 4th Street outlet is known for slow service and a blatant disregard for customer service... and sometimes technical difficulties! A reader tells us that those on line this past Saturday got the added treat of being told &quot;there was a problem getting the computers started and there would be a delay for the windows.&quot;</p>

<p>One woman, <em>in line right now</em>, sends us the above photo and tells us there are no less than 33 people in front of her, and &quot;only two people in the windows. People have been waiting for 45 minutes and longer!  People are getting angry. Calling the USPS number to complain.&quot; As we go to press our disgruntled tipster updates us, saying, &quot;Ugh. They just split the line. Now there is 1 person handling all the mail/ postage and 1 person doing package pick up. The line is shorter now but only because people got frustrated and left!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429115810/http://www.amazon.com/Hang-There-Inspirational-Art-1970s/dp/0811839974">Hang in there</a>.</p>
