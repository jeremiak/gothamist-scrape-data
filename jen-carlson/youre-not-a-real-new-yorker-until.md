<p>What makes a New Yorker? Ed Koch once said that &quot;to be a New Yorker you have to live here for six months, and if at the end of the six months you find you walk faster, talk faster, think faster, you&apos;re a New Yorker.&quot; R. L. Stine said that &quot;a real New Yorker likes the sound of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502003457/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/09/the_90-second_louie_scene_that.php">a garbage truck in the morning</a>.&quot; And David Bowie hinted that time was a factor, once saying, &quot;I realized the other day that I&apos;ve lived in New York longer than I&apos;ve lived anywhere else. It&apos;s amazing: I am a New Yorker. It&apos;s strange; I never thought I would be.&quot;</p>

<p>The most common answer to what makes a real New Yorker is either being born here, or having done at least a ten year stint, but there are variations on the theme. Every so often our own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502003457/http://gothamist.com/tags/askanativenewyorker">Jake Dobkin</a> will state that &quot;you ain&apos;t a real New Yorker until...&quot; <em>something</em>. A while back I created a document, titled &quot;Jake&apos;s Real New Yorkerisms,&quot; to keep track of these very specific declarations&#x2014;they include:</p><ul><li>&#x201C;You&apos;re not a real New Yorker until an actual rat has flown through the air and attacked you in the dead of night.&#x201D; - 6/12/13 <br>
</li><li>&quot;You ain&#x2019;t a real New Yorker until subway germs claim a finger&#x201D; - 11/18/15<br>
</li><li>&#x201C;You&apos;re not a real New Yorker until someone kicks you in the face and steals your backpack!  Welcome to the club.&#x201D; - 11/22/2008</li></ul>On the search to find <em>the realest</em> answer (is it &quot;until you cry on the subway&quot;?), we decided to hit the pavement to ask locals to finish the sentence for us &#x2014; a fool&apos;s errand perhaps, because as Dobkin stated on 3/8/14, &quot;There&apos;s no such thing as a &#x2018;real&#x2019; New Yorker, that&apos;s an illusion you&apos;re clinging to because of insecurity.&#x201D;<p></p>
