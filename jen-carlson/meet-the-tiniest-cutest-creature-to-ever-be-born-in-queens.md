<p>The best thing about teen tiny deer is that we can store lots of them in New York City, which is far too space-constrained for, say, a lot of rhinoceroses. The pudu are the smallest deer in the universe (that we know of), and are therefore a perfect fit for the city. Over in Queens, they&apos;ve been slowly multiplying in captivity.</p>

<p>A little pudu fawn was just born at the Queens Zoo, where we last saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011001337/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/photos_worlds_smallest_deer_born_in.php">a 1-lb. miracle</a> back in 2013. On the latest birth:</p>

<blockquote>Born on May 12, the male fawn is still nursing but will soon transition to a diet of fresh leaves, grain, kale, carrots and hay.  The white spots, characteristic to juveniles of many deer species, will fade and disappear as the fawn gets older. The arrival of the fawn brings the total number of pudu on exhibit at the Queens Zoo to three. This is the third year in a row this pair has successfully raised a fawn.</blockquote>

<p>100 more please!</p>

<p>A few facts about pudu: they bark when they sense danger and when chased, they run in a zig-zag pattern to escape predators, they&apos;re excellent jumpers, they are shy (awwwww), and they grow to be 12 to 14 inches.</p>
