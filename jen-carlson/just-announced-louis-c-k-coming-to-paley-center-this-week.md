<p>The amazing Paley Center has just announced that THIS THURSDAY our favorite golden-hearted ginger-headed human being, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074539/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a>, will take the stage for PaleyFest. Tickets go on sale to members this evening at 5 p.m., and to the general public tomorrow at noon (and will likely sell out in under two seconds). Don&apos;t say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074539/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/03/paleyfest_orange_is_the_new_black.php">we didn&apos;t warn you</a> to buy a membership!</p>

<p>It&apos;s been far too long (since... earlier this year) since any of us <em>not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074539/http://instagram.com/p/d6S0NJw1wA/">lucky enough to catch him at the Comedy Cellar</a></em> have seen Louis on a NYC stage&#x2014;so this is celebratory news.</p>

<p>We just got the news at 12:30 p.m. from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074539/http://www.paleycenter.org/">the Paley Center</a> folks, and will update when they have a link to more information and tickets. UPDATE: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074539/http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=3850044&amp;pl=nypf">Click here for the ticket link</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074539/http://www.paleycenter.org/madeinny-pf-2013-louie">the event page</a> now says &quot;additional panelists&quot; will be announced.</p>
