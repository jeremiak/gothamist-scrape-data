<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023238/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> has just posted this photo of his latest piece&#x2014;which is somewhere in Greenpoint&#x2014;on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023238/http://www.banksyny.com/2013/10/08/greenpoint">his website</a>. So far each piece in his month long open air residency on the streets of NYC have been different in style&#x2014;this one is all text, saying:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I have a theory that you can make any sentence seem profound by writing hte name of a dead philosopher at the end of it. &#x2014; Plato&quot;</blockquote>

<p>So anyone know where there&apos;s a grey-blue door in Greenpoint? Get there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023238/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/08/the_guy_who_keeps_tagging_the_banks.php">before Omar</a> does!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The piece is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023238/https://twitter.com/streetartnews/status/387637462874750976">266-270 Freeman Street</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 3 p.m.:</strong> The owner of the building (or someone who works there) first covered the piece with metal, presumably so he can sell the door...</p>

<p>And then he straight up just removed the door: </p>

<p>A witness to the removal, Manny Peralta from Bushwick, tells us, &quot;The workers didn&apos;t seem bothered... People just gathered In the front. Not saying much. Just watching two men working on the door. Happy Omar didn&apos;t get to destroy it but mad that I didn&apos;t make it time.&quot; He sent over this photo from the scene:</p>
