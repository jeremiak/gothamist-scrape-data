</div></div>					<p>Photographer William John Kennedy is believed to have taken the only photographs in existence of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001420/http://gothamist.com/tags/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001420/http://gothamist.com/tags/robertindiana">Robert Indiana</a>, and he&apos;s about to share what he saw through the lens. On April 19th an exhibition of newly published prints of the two will open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001420/http://www.site109.com/">at Site/109</a>, where they note the images of the artists show them with their works, including Warhol&#x2019;s Marilyn Monroe and Indiana&#x2019;s iconic LOVE. </p>

<p>The photographs have been in storage for nearly half a century, and will only be on exhibit for about a month, through May 29th. Click through for a look at the show, called <em>Before They Were Famous</em>.</p>

<p>Now, whatever happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001420/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/09/billy_name.php">those missing negatives</a> which have documentation of Warhol&apos;s Factory for about 7 years?</p>
