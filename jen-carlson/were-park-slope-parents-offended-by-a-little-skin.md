<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230742/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/babeland-vs-park-slope-breeders.html">FIPS</a> reported that Babeland (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230742/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/03/park_slope_decl.php">the lovable</a> sex toy shop in both Brooklyn and Manhattan) had plastered &quot;every construction fence in the 4th/5th Ave area with a wall of giant advertising posters featuring a tattooed, probably-naked-but-still-suitable-for-MTV/CW, couple ready for a roll in the hay.&quot; They noted that after the posters went up, they came down immediately as the Park Slope prudes didn&apos;t want their babies to spot them on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230742/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/park_slope_parents_still_bringing_b.php">the way to the bar</a>. The site didn&apos;t have an image of the poster, but we just got our hands on one... and we&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230742/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/23/video_katy_perry.php">more skin on <em>Sesame Street</em></a>!</p>

<p>The Babeland folks gave us a little background, saying the (totally legal) poster campaign went up in mid-December with a four week run date, and since they &quot;only pay for one time maintenance,&quot; they&apos;re not sure who was putting them back up once they were torn down. They also note that next time you have feedback, you can address them directly and they&apos;ll be happy to remove the posters. </p>

<p>Or maybe procure a toy at their shop and <em>relax</em>.</p>
