However, a former Warhol assistant, Gerard Malanga, says <em>he</em> created the piece. What&apos;s the connection? Malanga says he stored the work at Chamberlain&apos;s apartment, and sometime around the year 2000 the latter submitted it to the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board, who dubbed it an original! &quot;In 2004, Mr. Malanga claims, he ran into Mr. Chamberlain, who told him that he had sold the work as an authentic Warhol, for $5 million.&quot; The Supreme Court of the State of New York judge says the Warhol board&apos;s decision isn&apos;t binding on the court, however. Malanga is seeking to be compensated or to have the piece returned...or for his 15 minutes? His lawyer also noted that this case &quot;once again raises questions about the competence and integrity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063434/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/17/warhol.php">of the Warhol authentication board</a>.&quot; Burn!</p>
