title: 9 Nine Inch Nails Mashups You Should Hear
---

	
										<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104737/https://soundcloud.com/pomdeterrific/pomdeter-call-me-a-hole#new-timed-comment-at-166961">an amazing mash-up</a> spoke so perfectly to both my real teen years and to my current inner teenager. I listened. I wept. And then I went on a journey to find more NIN mashups, because if someone asked me my favorite genre of music right now, it would be &quot;Nine Inch Nails mashups.&quot; Below you can listen to the gems, along with the worst one in existence (and this is amongst <em>many worst</em>.) If you decide to seek out more on your own, be warned: you will want to click on so many of them&#x2014;the Fiona Apple one, the Tears for Fears one, the Phil Collins one, the Kanye one, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104737/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciyPX9i4yEo">this Queen one</a>&#x2014;they just aren&apos;t as good as you want them to be. It&apos;s a hard truth, but not <em>every</em> song blends well with &quot;Closer,&quot; mash-up artists.</p>

<p>The amazing creation that started going around late yesterday: <strong>Carly Rae Jepsen + Nine Inch Nails</strong> = Call Me A  Hole<br>

<p>Here&apos;s a soothing one&#x2014;<strong>Pretty Lights vs Radiohead vs Nirvana vs NIN</strong>:<br>

<p><strong>Nine Inch Nails + Nine Inch Nails</strong> because sometimes one song isn&apos;t enough<br>

<p><strong>Nine Inch Nails + Kool and the Gang</strong><br>

<p>Honorable Mention goes to <strong>Michael Jackson + Trent Reznor</strong> = Bad Like A Hole (this one isn&apos;t GREAT, but the image is <em>amazing</em>)<br>

<p>A lot of terrible things were seen and heard on our journey to discover more NIN mashups, but this was by far <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104737/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/308777428464062465">the most horrifying</a>, and not even because of the inclusion of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104737/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatality">suicide-by-subway</a> attempt. Some tips: at about the 18-second mark you&apos;ll think you get it, but you need to push through because it gets SO MUCH WORSE. At about 35 seconds, you&apos;ll open up Google to find out if this is a comedy duo. They are not.</p>
