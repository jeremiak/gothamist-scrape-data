Self-proclaimed &quot;French Entrepreneur and Vine Performer,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115214136/https://twitter.com/jeromejarre">Jerome Jarre</a>, says he does this &quot;pretty much everyday.&quot; <em>This</em> being subtly touching zoned-out strangers on the subway to see how they react, capturing it all on Vine. Certainly he&apos;s been punched for this at least once, but his latest victim seemed to take it all in stride... after initially shuddering in horror. </p>

<p>This is really bad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115214136/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a>, to be sure, but the 6-second video is just so mesmerizing. A real glimpse at raw human nature being tested in a place where we&apos;re all so very vulnerable: the subway.</p>
