<p>Pretentious, bearded hipsters that may or may not hate Russians have <em>finally</em> started producing classy, retro porn. (Their all-Asian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703225535/http://jacquesmag.blogspot.com/">issue</a> ships next week!) The married duo behind Jacques magazine&#x2014;Jonathan and Danielle Leder&#x2014;recently gave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703225535/http://www.revelinnewyork.com/videos/jacques-magazine">Revel</a> a peek into their world, which currently revolves around bringing classy porn back to the masses (articles included!). Aside from the aforementioned Asian issue, they seem to be placing an emphasis on the All-American aesthetic&#x2014;during the interview, they say they don&apos;t subscribe to the idea that Russian models are beautiful, and they let out a huge sigh of relief when another models tells them she&apos;s American.</p>

<p>Mr. Leder, who lives with his wife and son in Williamsburg, recently told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703225535/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/fashion/03porn.html?_r=1">the NY Times</a> that his cultural influences are mid-period Hugh Hefner and Norman Rockwell&#x2014;he also declared: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re trying to do something kind of wholesome, kind of family.&quot; Can we expect the L train set to be holding keys to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703225535/http://eater.com/archives/2010/09/27/the-new-york-playboy-club-on-mad-men.php">a Jacques Club</a> in the near future? </p>
