<p>The first thing you need to know about Cotton Candy Grapes is that they are not the product of some underground frankenfood genetics laboratory functioning deep below <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://chicagoist.com/2013/08/13/the_best_things_we_ate_and_drank_at.php#photo-1">the Iowa State Fair</a>. The all-natural grapes are the result of plant-breeding, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://www.grapery.biz/">California&apos;s Grapery</a>. The plant breeder offering up the treat says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://www.grapery.biz/index.php/grapes/cotton-candy">the Cotton Candy Grape</a> was created by cross pollinating wild grape species&#x2014;this is their first commercial harvest. But do they really taste like the puffy pink stuff of your childhood?</p>

<p>We procured some through Fresh Direct&#x2014;our 1.67 lbs came to around $6.70&#x2014;who are now offering the grapes (along with other Grapery items like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/https://www.freshdirect.com/product.jsp?catId=grp&amp;productId=fru_dmy_30621&amp;trk=srch">Witch Finger Grapes</a>). The Grapery&apos;s CEO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://www.kget.com/news/local/story/Local-company-produces-cotton-candy-grapes/nfyO9od340SLE_uidorYug.cspx">told KGET</a> that, &quot;They taste exactly like cotton candy. We&apos;ve had quite a few blind tastings where we don&apos;t tell people what it is they&apos;re going to be tasting, the first thing they say is cotton candy.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smgrapes0813.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smgrapes0813.jpg" width="325" height="329" class="image-right"> </span>Here&apos;s what Gothamist staffers thought after a tasting this morning:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;I think it&apos;s a surprisingly fantastic flavor combination. Tastes like the grapes have been aged in a cotton candy factory.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://twitter.com/yenbakas">Ben Yakas</a>
</li><li>&quot;My mouth hasn&apos;t touched cotton candy since the late &apos;80s, but these grapes were grea(p). They lack the tartness that causes me to avoid normal grapes, and they are also giant, but without seeds! I think they&apos;re the Perfect Grape.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://twitter.com/laurenfaceevans">Lauren Evans</a>
</li><li>&quot;These grapes are amazing, not a sour note in the bunch, and a true taste <em>and smell</em> of Cotton Candy. The only problem is that now I&apos;ll have to find out where I can get these for cheap. Do <em>you</em> know a guy? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">Email me</a>!&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://twitter.com/jenist">Jen Carlson</a>
</li><li>&quot;The flavor is pleasant, but there is something inherently disturbing about a natural flavor mimicking the Fiberglass Insulation of Candy. I&apos;ll stick to my tart grapes.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a>
</li><li>&quot;I detected a hint of cotton candy essence, an extra burst of sweetness, but that&apos;s perhaps because I was looking for it. If someone handed me a bunch of these grapes and didn&apos;t tell me they were special, I&apos;d just think they were regular grapes.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://twitter.com/nellcasey">Nell Casey</a>
</li><li>&quot;Just tasted like grapes to me. I&apos;d stick with with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/http://www.grapplefruits.com/">the Grapple</a>.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/https://twitter.com/marc_yearsley">Marc Yearsley</a></li></ul>

Have you spotted them at the market yet? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206174350/https://www.freshdirect.com/product.jsp?catId=grp&amp;productId=fru_dmy_10055&amp;trk=srch">Fresh Direct</a> is sold out right now, meaning we could have a new, healthier Cronut Craze on our hands.</p>
