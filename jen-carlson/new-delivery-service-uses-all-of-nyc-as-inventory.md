title: New Delivery Service Uses All Of NYC As Inventory

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpHowaaGPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102020im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpHowaaGPM.jpg" width="290" height="310" class="image-left"> </span>Just as we&apos;re being launched into the long, hot, humid days of summer, a new delivery service has beta-launched so lazy New Yorkers can stay in the air conditioning while someone else peddles to get Frappuccinos, or whatever. </p>

<p>Just like Kozmo, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102020/http://zipgigs.com/">ZipGigs</a> crew will bring you whatever your (out of shape) heart desires. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102020/http://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2010/05/start_up_runs_errands_you_cantwont_for_8_25">Brick Underground</a>, that means anything <em>except</em> alcohol or prescription meds&#x2014;which really is cutting out a huge demographic for them. But seriously, anything else and they&apos;re on it: your Shake Shack fix delivered right to your mouth, a post office drop-off, ramps from the farmer&apos;s market, and so on.</p>

<p>Co-founder Antonia Abraham explained it like this: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re an on-demand personal assistant. Our model expands upon what Kozmo did while providing additional services. [Kozmo and UrbanFetch] had inventory that they pulled from, whereas our inventory is New York.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the price range: expect a trip to your local Duane Reade to cost around $10 bucks, and an outer neighborhood jaunt to cost double that.</p>
