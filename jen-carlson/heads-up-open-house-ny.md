This will all go down on October 10th and 11th, with 350 tours, talks and programs in all five boroughs. Renee Schacht, executive director of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520000740/http://gothamist.com/tags/ohny">OHNY</a>, says &quot;This year, we are thrilled to feature private residences, historic landmarks, architect and artist studios, and new sites that demonstrate sustainable design.&#x201D;    <p></p>

<p>Some of the highlights they&apos;ve announced are the Apollo Theater; the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel; a contemporary live-work architectural studio in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn&#x2014;a contemporary gut renovation of a historic 1899 carriage house; the award winning Slot House in Fort Greene. Some old favorites will return, as well, including: the Alice Austen House, Angels and Accordions at The Green-Wood Cemetery, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Ellis Island&apos;s South Side and many, many more.</p>

<p>This year they&apos;ll also raffle off a behind-the-scenes-tour of the Woolworth Buildlling at their opening party that Friday (held at the The Visionaire, aka: the greenest residential development in the United States).</p>
