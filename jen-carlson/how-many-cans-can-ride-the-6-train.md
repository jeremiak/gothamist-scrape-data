<p>This scene was spotted on the 6 train by Grand Central earlier today. Question: Is it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005511/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaydouchery">Subway Douchery</a> if someone is doing something nice for the environment? </p>

<p>Reader Daria told us it was the man you see pictured who brought all the cans on the train, and &quot;a few older women were asking him questions about it, he seemed happy to oblige.  I overheard him say he pays his rent on time every month.&quot; Which he probably gets from cashing in those cans... provided he doesn&apos;t incur any fines with his transport method. Hey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005511/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/02/how_much_can_you_earn_picking_up_bo.php">this guy</a>: you&apos;re doing it wrong.</p>
