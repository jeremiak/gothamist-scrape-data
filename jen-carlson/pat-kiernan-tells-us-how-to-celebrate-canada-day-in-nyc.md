<p>In 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/20/ny1s_pat_kiernan_takes_gothamist_re.php#photo-1">we learned about Canada Day</a> from New York City treasure Pat Kiernan. For four years, every July 1st, we celebrated Canada Day with Kiernan, some Gothamist readers, and plates of poutine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/poutine.php#photo-1">hitting up</a> every <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/photos_a_belated_canada_day_celebra.php#photo-1">Canadian joint</a> in town until we eventually ran out of Canadian joints <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/10/photos_our_4th_annual_poutine_dinne.php#photo-1">in 2012</a>. Until we manage to carve out a Little Canada section in Manhattan, we&apos;re left hacking together our own ways to celebrate The Great White North&#x2014;luckily, Kiernan has supplied us with the below list. Now get to Canadianing!</p>

<ul><li>Start your day with a wood-fired Montreal-style bagel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://www.blackseedbagels.com/">from Black Seed</a>. Montreal bagels are wood-fired and not as doughy as New York bagels. I think they&apos;re particularly good for toasting. 
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Recreation/Pages/Events/Canada-day.aspx?redirect=/canadaday">Fly to Calgary for fireworks</a>. You can work a full day and catch Westjet flight 1681 at JFK at 6 p.m. With the time zone change and the long summer days in Canada you&#x2019;ll land in Calgary more than an hour before the Canada Day fireworks start. Bonus points: ride the Bombardier-built Airtrain to JFK for extra Canadian credit.
</li><li>Shop Canadian: Northern staple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150519/REAL_ESTATE/150519861/fashion-retailer-joe-fresh-to-shutter-its-fifth-avenue-stores">Joe Fresh</a> has scaled back its New York presence a bit. But, like Tim Horton&#x2019;s, it&#x2019;s hanging on to a customer base that includes some recent converts and Canadians who were already familiar with the brand. 
</li><li>Eat and drink Canadian: Burger and poutine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913225117/http://www.bigsmokeburger.com/">at Big Smoke</a>.
