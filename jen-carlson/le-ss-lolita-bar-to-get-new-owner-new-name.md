<p>Around 2004 Lolita Bar on Broome Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902032900/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenc/tags/lolita/">was my living room</a>, because my actual apartment&apos;s living room was more like a hallway. The bar was just downstairs from me, and during that era it was generally pretty quiet inside, with kitschy lamps and reupholstered vintage couches to give it that homey vibe. Throughout the years the area south of Delancey, and the bar itself, became more popular, but even in its current, more crowded days I&apos;ll stop by to soak up some wine and nostalgia. So it was with great sadness that I read this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902032900/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2013/02/marshall-stack-owner-taking-over-lolita-bar-on-broome/">Bowery Boogie report</a> on Lolita changing hands and possibly changing its name.</p>

<p>According to the site, the mainstay&#x2014;named for the former bra shop around the corner on Orchard Street&#x2014;was purchased by Marshall Stack owner Matthew Kelly. (This part is sort of a relief, as Marshall Stack is an excellent establishment, despite being cash-only.) He has reportedly purchased the Lolita assets and is seeking to transfer the liquor license. They note, &quot;Name change is likely but not yet confirmed.&quot; It&apos;s unclear if he&apos;ll keep the atmosphere the same, but we&apos;re guessing that the downstairs may get an overhaul, if nothing else&#x2014;that space has always been kept pretty raw aside from some benches and a forest wall mural.</p>

<p>What else may change? Kelly hopes to incorporate food into the bar&apos;s offerings... and maybe he&apos;ll bring over some Night Train, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902032900/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenc/251603748/">we&apos;ve procured</a> from Marshall Stack in the past.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We hear there has been no transfer of assets yet, but there is someone interested in purchasing the bar. And the bar is confirmed to be on the CB3 docket next month for a possible liquor license transfer. We&apos;ll update when we know more.</p>
