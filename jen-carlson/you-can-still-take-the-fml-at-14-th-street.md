<p>This just in: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153851/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/14/fml.php">the FML station stop</a> lives on! A reader sent us this photo today taken yesterday at the 14th Street subway entrance (NW side). When the MTA was first alerted to the fact that their subway signage was mirroring an internet meme, they said they would remedy the situation with new &quot;L&quot; stickers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153851/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/17/mta_goes_from_fml_to_lfm.php">which they did</a>... but it appears they neglected to remove some of the <em>old</em> ones. Either that, or one lone man is lurking around out there with a backpack full of &quot;L&quot; stickers and a dream.</p>
