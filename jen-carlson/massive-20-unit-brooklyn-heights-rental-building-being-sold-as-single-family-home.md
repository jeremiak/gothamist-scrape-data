<p>A building in Brooklyn Heights is being sold, which is not insane, but the 20-unit rental building is being sold as a <em>single-family home</em>, which IS insane. No one tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102604/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/trump_watchtower_classy.php">Trump&apos;s son-in-law</a>. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102604/http://www.wsj.com/articles/brooklyn-apartment-building-hits-the-market-as-a-22-million-single-home-1460643102">the WSJ</a>, the building at Orange and Hicks Streets, previously owned by the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses (who have been steadily selling off their properties in the neighborhood) is going for $22 million. </p>

<p>The building was originally sold in January for $13/5 million, and is now being marketed as a single-family home by the Benchmark Real Estate Group&#x2014;&quot;while some tenants are still in place, the roughly 14,500-square-foot building will be delivered vacant,&quot; the agent told the paper. Good thing there&apos;s no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102604/http://gothamist.com/tags/housingcrisis">housing crisis</a> in NYC!</p>

<p>Under Benchmark&apos;s lock and key, the building got a new design plan from Lee Stahl, who drew up &quot;plans to convert the building into a single-family home with four bedrooms, a gym, an 800-bottle wine cellar and a roof terrace. A buyer would be free to use those plans... or not.&quot; If they chose to go with that plan, renovations are being tallied up to around $10.6 million. Being part of the Brooklyn Heights Historic District, renovations to the building would need to be cleared by the LPC.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102604/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/4/15/11438284/brooklyn-heights-megamansion-rental-conversion">Curbed</a> notes, new tenants started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102604/http://streeteasy.com/building/50-orange-street-brooklyn#tab_building_detail=3">renting in the 50 Orange Street building</a> less than a year ago. We&apos;ve reached out to Benchmark to see if the new buyer would be able to keep the building intact with rental units and will update if we hear back.</p>
