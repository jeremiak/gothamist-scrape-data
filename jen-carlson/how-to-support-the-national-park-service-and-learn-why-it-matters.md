<p>This week President Gaslight did not take kindly to truthful-yet-unflattering tweets about the size of his Inauguration crowd, which were retweeted by the National Park Service. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14372940/trump-gag-order-epa-environmental-protection-agency-health-agriculture">His administration put a gag order on them</a>, and the tweets were removed. However, some Parks still won&apos;t bend to his will&#x2014;on Tuesday, the official Twitter account for Badlands National Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/http://laist.com/2017/01/24/badlands_twitter_ftw.php">went rogue</a> and started dropping <em>actual scientific facts </em>(they were later removed), and on Wednesday the Death Valley National Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/http://laist.com/2017/01/25/death_valley_national_park_joins.php">joined in</a>, and some National Park Service employees may have started an &apos;Alt&apos; resistance Twitter account. &quot;You can take our official twitter,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/http://laist.com/2017/01/25/national_park_service_employees_hav.php">they said</a>, &quot;but you&apos;ll never take our free time!&quot; </p>

<p>We should be supporting these heroes, some of whom will likely lose their jobs for this, and supporting our national parks, which Republicans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/http://www.businessinsider.com/congress-lays-groundwork-to-get-rid-of-federal-land-and-national-parks-2017-1">seem determined to dispose of</a>. Below, how you can give them your money, learn more about them, and immerse yourself in their beauty.</p>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/http://www.pendleton-usa.com/section/national-parks/2268.uts"><strong>Everything at Pendleton</strong></a>. Again, Pendleton is a company that has thrown huge support behind the NPS, and a portion of each National Park Collection purchase helps fund park restoration projects through a donation to the National Park Foundation. Currently those are the Many Glacier Hotel Stairway Project and the Grand Canyon Train Depot Project. One of the Twitter accounts who joined the resistance was Badlands, and you can find a whole line dedicated to that park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/http://www.pendleton-usa.com/thumbnail/National-Parks/Shop-By-Park/Badlands/2248/c/2269/pc/2268.uts">right here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Donate Or Get An Annual Pass</strong>. And finally, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/index.htm">plan a visit</a> and/or donate to the NPS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/https://www.nps.gov/getinvolved/donate.htm">through their website</a>. They offer options, too, the best of which is to pay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm">$80 for an annual pass</a>. You can also donate to a specific park, to a park friends group, or to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042523/https://www.nationalparks.org/">the National Park Foundation</a>, which is their Congressionally chartered national philanthropic partner to support our national programs. You can probably even donate in Trump&apos;s name.</p>
