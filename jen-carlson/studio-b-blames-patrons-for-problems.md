<p>While neighborhood blogs have been documenting the club&apos;s presence, much to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170121025837/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=5932">the dismay</a> of the people who run it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170121025837/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/30/31_30_bm_studiob.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> now steps in to give the issue some ink -- and they report that the club is blaming the patrons for all their problems! At the last CB1 meeting, held earlier this month, community members complained about &quot;public urination, litter and trash, and loud and obnoxious behavior in the middle of the night,&#x201D; but now <strong>&quot;Ken Fisher &#x2014; Studio B&#x2019;s lawyer and a well-connected former Councilman &#x2014; said that fingers should be pointed at the clubgoers, not the club.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The recent addition of a roof deck, which the club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170121025837/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/28/studio_b_1.php">hasn&apos;t had permits</a> to actually build (but has appeared and opened nonetheless) also has some neighbors up in arms. One declared: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have a problem with there being a nightclub there; I just I want to be able to sit in my garden and have a beer with friends and not have to hear every noise from in there. They need to be more respectful to the fact that they have neighbors on three sides.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170121025837/http://greenpointers.blogspot.com/2008/07/studio-mis-b-ehaving.html">One local</a> calls the venue out for misbehaving, not for any of the above reasons -- but for placing blame on the patrons of the club. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170121025837/http://www.cb1brooklyn.org/cb1_cal.htm">next CB1 meeting</a> regarding Studio B&apos;s cabaret license will take place this Thursday at 435 Graham Avenue.</p>
