With songs ranging from &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; to &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; we were really, possibly unneccessarily, excited to find this. </p>

<p>Karaoke bars are expensive, and with this we can set up our own karaoke room. BYOB, nice clean couches to sit on, and no fee whatsoever. The only setback is the lack of microphones. We guess hairbrushes could work, they did in elementary school, but we&apos;re sure a motivated karaoke fan could also buy their own mic setup. </p>

<p>So there you go, Karaoke On Demand, plan your night accordingly. </p>
