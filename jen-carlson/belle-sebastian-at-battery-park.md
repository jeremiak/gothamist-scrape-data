title: Belle & Sebastian at Battery Park

										<p>Today Martha Wainwright and Belle &amp; Sebastian played at the River to River Festival in Battery Park. Rain and an electrical storm threatened the show...<br>
</p><p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103729/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/181986099_d9faa4f258.jpg"><img alt="181986099_d9faa4f258.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103729im_/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/181986099_d9faa4f258-thumb.jpg" width="450" height="337"></a></p><p><br>
But after some downpours and delays, the show went on. Belle &amp; Sebastian played an amazing, and long, set - bringing on stage with them a string section that they claim actually showed up at the park that morning asking to play with the band. </p>

<p>Masters at working the crowd, the band had the audience hanging on every word, lyric, sound and move. One fan was brought up on stage, one asked to apply mascara on singer Stuart Murdoch and one taking the mic to help sing. Murdoch also addressed the whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103729/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2006/06/the_belle_sebas.html">ticket issue</a>, not mentioning that coffee shop by name, saying if they had known they would have surely done something about it. </p>

<p>One of the encores included a Jimi Henrix at Woodstock-esque version of the Star Spangled Banner. </p>
