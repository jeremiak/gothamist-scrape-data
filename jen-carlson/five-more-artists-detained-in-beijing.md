title: Five More Artists Detained in Beijing
---

	
										<p>Following yesterday&apos;s news of Graffiti Research Lab founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405012253/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/19/grl_founder_detained_in_beijing.php">James Powderly</a> being detained in Beijing, came news of five other American artists being held for a similar reason. The pro-Tibet activists held a banner with the words &#x201C;Free Tibet&#x201D; written in bright blue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405012253/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/15/graffiti_artist_1.php">LED throwies</a> in both English and Chinese. The peaceful protest took place in Beijing&#x2019;s Olympic Park, and within 20 seconds the five were being detained.<br>

<p>A rep for the Students for a Free Tibet, who organized the protests, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405012253/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/sports/olympics/20china.html?ref=asia">The NY Times</a>: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re always worried when someone is in Chinese detention.&#x201D; A source close to Powderly tells us there is no new information on his whereabouts; likewise, no one seems to know where these five artists are being held. One of them, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405012253/http://freetibet2008.org/globalactions/lightbanner/">24-year-old Samantha Corbin</a>, is from Brooklyn (by way of the Bronx).</p>
