<p>Last week we dropped by Alidoro&apos;s midtown outpost, at 39th Street and Madison, to see how the sandwiches get made. Because... have you tried one? They are hands-down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030158/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/04/best_sandwiches_nyc.php">the best sandwich</a> in New York City, and beyond. </p>

<p>The shop originally opened as Melampo in 1986 on Sullivan Street in SoHo. It was there that the current man behind the magic, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030158/http://www.alidoronyc.com/our-story/">Walter Moment&#xE8;</a>, studied as an apprentice under the original owner. Moment&#xE8;, a Venice, Italy native, took over the shop in 2001, and has owned and operated it since. On the business and building end, he&apos;s got co-owners Tommy Polihronopoylos and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030158/http://ncadvertiser.com/47206/local-boy-makes-good-sandwiches-at-his-restaurant-in-nyc/#axzz3yIQkcCBs">Jon Streep</a> making things happen, allowing him to put 100% passion into the sandwiches.</p>

<p>There are about 40 different options on the menu (ranging from vegetarian to very, very <em>not</em> vegetarian) stuffed with the freshest ingredients and offered on a selection of breads (most are scooped in preparation!). Moment&#xE8; pours the same amount of passion into coming up with new sandwiches as he does into assembling them, which you&apos;ll see in the video above&#x2014;but he also sources and makes all of the ingredients, hand-picking and purchasing items like fresh mozzarella every morning on his way in. </p>

<p>We&apos;re told his &quot;careful attention to detail goes all the way back to his childhood in Italy, where he was brought up making pizzas and other Italian dishes in his parents&apos; restaurant, pizzeria, and supermarket.&quot; During our visit Moment&#xE8; told us he eats about an average of 300 sandwiches a year, and he credits these fresh ingredients for keeping him at a healthy weight despite that high number.</p>

<p>This second location on 39th Street opened last year, and both spots are extremely popular&#x2014;if you go around lunchtime you&apos;ll find it packed, but their offerings are worth any wait you&apos;re faced with&#x2014;for around $9 to $15, you can get a sandwich that will last you through two meals. Check out their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030158/http://www.alidoronyc.com/menu-1-1">menu here</a>, which now features special hot sandwiches.</p>
