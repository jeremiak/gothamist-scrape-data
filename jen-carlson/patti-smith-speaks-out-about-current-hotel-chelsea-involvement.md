<p>Earlier this week the remaining residents of the Hotel Chelsea received <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190309/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/patti_smith_to_play_private_hotel_c.php">an invitation to a private Patti Smith concert</a> to be held inside of the hotel, which is currently under new management and undergoing massive renovations. A major criticism has been that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190309/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/05/photos_of_the_hotel_chelsea.php">the hotel is being gutted</a> of its original character that current and past residents helped create, along with the Bard family, who ran the hotel for a majority of its existence until ousted a few years ago. In fact, Patti Smith, thanks to the Bard family, lived there on two separate occasions.</p>

<p>When the concert, which will be held tomorrow night, was announced, residents asked that she cancel the show, assuming current developer Joseph Chetrit was involved. Now Smith has released a statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190309/http://www.pattismith.net/news.html">on her website</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>My current involvement with the Hotel Chelsea began some months ago when I heard rumors that the hotel would be leveled. I was devastated and entered in a dialogue with the architect, through a mutual friend.

<p>He assured me this was not the case and every effort would be made to save and restore the building, which was greatly deteriorating. Having witnessed the demolition and redevelopment of much of our city I was at least hopeful that the hotel would stand.</p>

<p>Since then my few efforts on behalf of the Hotel have been unofficial and uncompensated. My dialogue has continued with the architect. My personal objectives have always been: To offer uncompensated advice as to the aesthetics of the renovation project. To council all concerned to develop positive communication with the rightful tenants. To be available in the future, without fee, in participating in the development and preservation of the artistic cachet of the hotel. To participate in the development of a possible artists-in-residence program.</p>

<p><strong>My small performance for the tenants was my own idea. My hope is that we might have a nice evening and the opportunity to communicate directly. I am an independent person, not owned or directed by anyone. My allegiance is to the Hotel itself, and I have done nothing to tarnish it.</strong> It is very difficult for me to embrace change, but my great hope is to witness the Hotel Chelsea find a strong and positive place in the twenty-first century.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Two current residents of the hotel, who recently told us that Chetrit is trying to evict the remaining residents via the housing and Supreme court, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190309/http://www.chelseahotelblog.com/living_with_legends_the_h/2012/01/chelsea-hotel-blog-response-to-patti-smith-.html">have responded</a> to Smith, saying:</p>

<blockquote>Thanks Patti, for responding.  If you are worried about the building being leveled, you can put your mind at rest&#x2014;it&#x2019;s landmarked and can&#x2019;t be torn down.  As for management efforts to save and restore the building there aren&#x2019;t any.  Instead they are gutting the rooms.   We are worried about who the rightful tenants are going to turn out to be&#x2014;obviously not the more than 30 who are being evicted and as for the artist in residence program,  there are already plenty of those here. We are glad that you aren&#x2019;t  taking compensation but you should not let the Chetrits use you for propaganda purposes. If you want to give a concert for us great,  but choose a neutral venue, one where Chetrit will not be sponsoring you. We still think you should cancel your event in the ballroom.</blockquote>

<p>Your move, Smith.</p>
