</div></div>					<p>NYC <em>before</em> Urban Outfitters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010528/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/17/walgreens_and_duane_reade_together.php">Duane Readegreens</a> and Starbucks popped up on every block? Here&apos;s a look back to the &apos;80s for nostalgia-heads, courtesy of photographer David Vega. Instead of focusing on CBGB, however, what about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010528/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SLICES/lonestar/lonestar2.html">Lone Star Cafe</a> (1976-1989)? It was on East 13th Street and Fifth Avenue, and brought in mostly country acts, from Willie Nelson to Roy Orbison&#x2014;though James Brown and the Blues Brothers also took the stage there. </p>

<p>In 1989 the venue was sold, according to an old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010528/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/04/nyregion/funky-former-icon-of-downtown-finds-a-new-lair.html?pagewanted=all">NY Times</a> article, the iguana went on the auction block and had been living in Virginia until 1997, when it returned to NYC. It was then housed at Pier 25, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010528/http://vassifer.blogs.com/photos/my_vanishing_downtown/imlone.html">word is</a> it has since vanished. </p>

<p>These days, don&apos;t even expect to see the shell of the former venue&#x2014;it burned down and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010528/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/07/29/central_village_stunner_61_fifth_avenue_revealed.php">condos</a> are going up in its place. You can, however, get an interior look through Bob Fosse&apos;s 1979 <em>All That Jazz</em>, the film&apos;s nightclub scenes were shot there.</p>
