title: Ugly Betty Takes Over DUMBO
---

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120084022/http://dumbonyc.com/2008/07/07/ugly-betty-filming/">All signs pointed to <em>Ugly Betty</em></a> taking over DUMBO today (remember,  this 3rd season the show has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120084022/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/07/ugly_betty.php">moved filming to New York</a>), and even though the show infiltrated the cobblestone streets, no one really noticed in the sweet shadow of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120084022/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/08/van_leeuwen_ice_cream_truck_spotted.php">the Van Leeuwan Ice Cream Truck</a>. For fans of <em>Betty</em>, here are some scenes that confused onlookers were treated to...the cast and crew should be out there til around 9 p.m. tonight.</p>

<p>America Fererra, Becki Newton (who plays Amanda) and Michael Urie (who plays Marc) were all on set -- and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120084022/http://dumbonyc.com/2008/07/08/paparazzi-ready-for-ugly-betty">paparazzi were there</a> to watch every move (likely hoping to see Lindsay Lohan, who has appeared on the show). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120084022/http://filminginbrooklyn.com/2008/07/08/ugly-betty-spends-first-day-in-new-york-shooting-in-dumbo/">Filming in Brooklyn</a> has some additional pics, as does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120084022/http://www.flickr.com/photos/carrotcreative">CarrotCreative</a>.  Maybe they&apos;ll be at Metropolitan Life Insurance&apos;s North Building sometime soon, since that&apos;s where the show is set.</p> <div class="galleryEase" id="gallery-0">
