According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150001/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/light_reading_at_library_6oh9hO9NpzgvenhUr1rOwM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, the dramatic outdoor lights will bathe the landmark in a white glow, and NYPL president Paul LeClerc told the paper, &quot;<strong>The goal is to make it look like the buildings in Paris that are illuminated.</strong> We want to make the building a destination stop in New York at night.&quot; The lighting scheme cost $3MM (it was paid for privately) and will include 48 large floodlights and 22-foot-high light poles surrounding the building. Expect full illumination to be in effect by next May&#x2014;and let&apos;s hope the unveiling includes a cameo by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150001/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/video_ghostbusters.php">the Ghostbusters</a>.</p>
