<p>There&apos;s nothing more fun than seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608224351/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">Hollywood inaccurately portray New York City</a> <em>as it&apos;s happening</em> and before it hits the big screen. This pop-up subway stop is the latest example&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608224351/http://instagram.com/p/PfXg3msz2Q/">this</a> was spotted today on 57th Street and 10th Avenue... nowhere near where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608224351/http://mta.info/nyct/service/sevenlin.htm">the 7 train</a> runs. Which means, since this is clearly not meant to be a portrayal of Times Square or Grand Central (where the 7 stops in Manhattan), it has to be Queens. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608224351/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/woody_allen_spotted_filming_on_the.php">Woody Allen</a>, we really hope you are not responsible for this.</p>
