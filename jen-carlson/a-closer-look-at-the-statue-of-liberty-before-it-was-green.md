title: A Closer Look At The Statue Of Liberty Before It Was Green
---

	
										<p>We&apos;ve looked at a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045126/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/the_statue_of_liberty.php#photo-1">old photos of the Statue of Liberty</a> when it was being built, and of course we knew it wasn&apos;t <em>always</em> green... but since those old photos are black &amp; white we&apos;ve never really seen Lady Liberty in her original copper brown hue. So when we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045126/http://bigcityvintagenyc.tumblr.com/post/66111448848/i-just-bought-this-1907-postcard-off-of-etsy-i">saw this postcard</a> circulating, we got curious. Turns out someone colored in one of those old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045126/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/17/statue.php#photo-1">photos we&apos;ve visited</a> before to show what she looked like until she naturally oxidized and turned green around 1920. Behold!</p>

<p>Her current torch, replaced 25 years ago, is a copper flame covered in 24-carat gold, and has a similar shiny appearance to how the entire statue used to look:</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a little more on the Lady&apos;s transformation:</p>
