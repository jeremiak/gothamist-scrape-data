title: See How Dramatically This Times Square Address Has Changed In 80 Years
---

	
										<p>After World War I, Times Square grew into something closer to what it is today: a busy crossroads with hotels, theaters, and plenty of people. It was a gathering spot, and in the 1920s companies took notice, and advertising became a more visible part of its landscape&#x2014;the prominence of flashy signs and lights even had its critics back then. Namely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708082859/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen">Thorstein Veblen</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708082859/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>, who said of the area, &quot;How beautiful it would be for some one who could not read.&#x201D; </p>

<p>To show how much the area has changed since advertising began blanketing its surfaces, here is 234 West 42nd Street in 1924:</p>

<p>And here is 234 West 42nd Street, the same exact location, in 2002:</p>

<p>By 2014 the area really toned down &#x2014; still, what would ol&apos; Chesterton say now?</p>
