<p>Floyd Hayes&#x2014;possibly taking a cue from the guy who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403010518/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/nyc_trash.php">selling NYC garbage</a> for over a decade&#x2014;is selling bits and pieces of Brooklyn, the borough that you&apos;re most likely to make money off of right now. For your 4 bucks you&apos;ll get a &quot;small piece of stone that I pick up off the streets of Brooklyn&quot; in a plastic case stamped: Piece of Brooklyn. That&apos;s right, potential customer: tiny pieces of rocks from New York&apos;s TRENDIEST BOROUGH are just $4! That&apos;s Staten Island pricing! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403010518/http://www.psfk.com/2013/09/pieces-of-brooklyn-art.html">PSFK declared</a> the project&#x2014;currently housed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403010518/http://www.etsy.com/shop/PieceOfBrooklyn">on Etsy</a>&#x2014;to be downright &quot;quirky&quot;! Okay.</p>

<p>Hayes, who moved here from the UK about ten years, says his pieces give anyone a chance to &quot;own their very own piece of the coolest neighborhood in the world.&quot; But like, why do we always have to claim ownership on things, man? Can&apos;t we just let Brooklyn <em>be</em>? At least the entrepreneur is donating $1 from every sale to the Brooklyn Arts Council. </p>

<p>Want to sell your own Brooklyn junk to suckers? Here&apos;s a visual guide on how this works: </p>
