<p>Around 3:30 this morning a reader spotted this subway car covered with some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222546/http://gothamist.com/tags/graffiti">fresh elaborate graffiti</a> on the side&#x2014;a familiar sight decades ago, but a somewhat rare phenomenon these days. The tagged car was rolling through the Metropolitan Avenue station in Middle Village, Queens at the time. </p>

<p>Adam Lisberg at the MTA told us this morning, &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t happen often&#x2014;we&#x2019;re vicious about taking cars out of service as soon as graffiti is discovered.&quot; He added that a train in this condition likely wouldn&apos;t even make a single journey, and would be sent straight to a terminal for cleaning. Which seems to have been the fate of this one. Lisberg did some digging and found out that &quot;this car came straight from the yard to start a run from Metropolitan Avenue, and when they saw it had been marked like this, they immediately took it back out of service.

<p>In January <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222546/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/10/photo_graffiti-laden_subway_spotted.php">another tag was spotted on a car</a>, and at the time Gothamist in-house graffiti expert Jake Dobkin believed it may have been the work of foreigners: &quot;Europeans do love to come to NYC and try to get up on a train. Most New York writers don&apos;t, because they know how quickly the trains will get buffed.&quot;</p>
