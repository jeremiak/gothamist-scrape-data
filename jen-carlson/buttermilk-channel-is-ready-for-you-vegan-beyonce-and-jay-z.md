<p>Jay Z announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123149/http://lifeandtimes.com/22-days-challenge">on his website</a> that he and Beyonce would be going vegan for 22 days, writing:</p><blockquote>&quot;On December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!! This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a &apos;plant-based breakfast&apos; everyday. It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought. Why now? There&#x2019;s something spiritual to me about it being my 44th birthday and the serendipity behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2+2=4) coupled with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas day&#x2026;It just feels right!<p></p>

<p>So you can call it a spiritual and physical cleanse. I will post my progress&#x2026; Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots please help out! Please ha. I don&#x2019;t know what happens after Christmas. A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We&#x2019;ll see&#x2026;</p>

<p>P.S. B is also joining me.&quot;</p></blockquote>Well, that has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123149/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/really_famous_people_went_to_a_park.php">their pal Gwyneth</a> written all over it. <p></p>

<p>While there are plenty of great vegan restaurants around the city, Jay Z and Beyonce have some favorite spots that aren&apos;t entirely &quot;plant-based,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123149/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/01/no_baby_only_buttermilk_channel_for.php">namely Buttermilk Channel</a>, where the two have enjoyed chicken and waffles time and again. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123149/http://www.buttermilkchannelnyc.com/">The restaurant</a> does offer a stellar vegetarian menu to accompany their meat-based one, but we reached out to owner Doug Crowell to find out what vegan options the two may enjoy there. He tells us: </p>

<p>&quot;We have always offered a separate vegetarian menu so we&apos;re ready for them! Ryan (the chef) actually just introduced a really wonderful new vegan entree (note: the vegan version is served without the egg on top). It&apos;s an heirloom bean stew made with beautiful beans from Rancho Gordo in California, and some gently cooked braising greens over a thick slice of grilled sourdough bread.  Rancho Gordo sells some truly special beans. We know Jay Z and Beyonce don&apos;t mess around. If they&apos;re going to eat beans for dinner, Goya will just not do.&quot;</p>
