<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520121041/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">The High Line</a> only just opened to the public this past June, but already it&apos;s facing a $2 million lawsuit. We&apos;ve been told by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520121041/http://nycparkadvocates.org/">NYC Park Advocates</a> that &quot;a basic design flaw that regularly causes pedestrians to trip has rendered the vast majority of the first section of the million High Line promenade a hazard.&quot; </p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed by 66-year old Paula Meinetz-Shapiro, who tripped on &quot;raised, uneven, depressed, decorative concrete&quot; in the park back in June, causing her to break her left ankle. She&apos;s seeking her payout from the City and the Parks Department, but <em>not</em> the designers of the park.</p>

<p>Falls aren&apos;t uncommon on the High Line, either&#xA0;&#x2014; there&apos;s plenty of seemingly harmless design aspects that are just waiting to trip you up! These hazards include raised concrete slabs and camouflaged curbs. An employee of the High Line says, &quot;People are tripping all the time. It&apos;s been a big issue.&quot; The problem has led to signs and rope blocking parts of the park off, but there&apos;s no word on if a more permanent fix will be put in place during Phase II of the park&apos;s construction.</p>
