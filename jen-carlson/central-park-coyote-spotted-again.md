We&apos;ve received several more reports of sightings; one three days ago at 5:30 p.m., another two days ago in the afternoon... and now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152025/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/coyote-on-ice/">NY Times</a> reader has sent in some great photographs of the little guy! The UWS resident spotted him walking past the pond in Central Park on Tuesday when &quot;the animal came out of the Hallett Nature Sanctuary and walked across the frozen pond several times. It seemed timid and skittish and kept retreating back to the sanctuary&#x2014;avoiding humans? It kept a watchful eye on me.&quot; The Parks Department <em>still</em> hasn&apos;t responded to our requests for comment about the coyote, so since he&apos;s still out there&#x2014;why don&apos;t we give him a name? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152025/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/22/meep_meep_coyot.php">The 2006 Central Park coyote</a> (RIP) was named Hal.</p>
