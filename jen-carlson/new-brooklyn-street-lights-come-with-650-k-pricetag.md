Brooklyn Heights Association President Judy Stanton brokered a $650,000 deal in order to replace the <em>already functioning</em> streetlamps in Brooklyn Heights with more old timey looking ones. How quaint!<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925125108/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/08/31/2009-08-31_pols_secure_650g_in_stimulus_funds_for_brooklyn_hts_streetlamps.html">The Daily News</a> reports that the &quot;upscale neighborhood is getting 65 new streetlamps this fall at $10,000 a pop. But they&apos;re not just any run-of-the-mill streetlamps; these will be fashioned with filigreed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925125108/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/LAMPS/Bishops%20crooks/bishop.html">bishop&apos;s crooks</a> to make them look like antique streetlamps.&quot; All in all, they hope to replace 229 lights for a whopping grand total of $2.7 million! </p>

<p>As one might imagine, this is not settling well with many people beyond Councilman David Yassky, Rep. Nydia Velazquez and Stanton herself. Locals have called it a waste of money; one telling the paper, &quot;The money should be spent fixing the potholes&#x2014;they&apos;re the worst. I wish for better roads every time I get in a car.&quot; And another declared, &quot;It&apos;s not right. They should give that money to the homeless. There are a lot of shelters that could use help.&quot;</p>
