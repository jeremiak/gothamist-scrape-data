<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041048/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/18/central_park_hawk_goes_missing_her.php">Recently</a> Lola flew out of her long time mate, Pale Male&apos;s life (many feared her dead). The urban hawk couple were Manhattan&apos;s most famous red tailed hawks, and Lola&apos;s disappearance was followed by many of the city&apos;s human residents believing they spotted her elsewhere around town. Whether or not she it still out there, Pale Male has moved on... twice! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041048/http://urbanhawks.blogs.com/urban_hawks/2011/02/new-female-on-fifth-avenue.html">Urban Hawks</a>, &quot;a fairly dark female appeared on the scene.  After a few weeks, this relationship didn&apos;t work out and she left the park. Pale Male now has a second girlfriend.  They seem to be much more of a couple and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if she becomes the permanent mate.&quot; Some video of the new couple, below:</p>
