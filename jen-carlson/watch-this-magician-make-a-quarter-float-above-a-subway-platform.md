<p>If you&apos;ve ever seen Christopher Nolan&apos;s <em>The Prestige</em>, then you know that magic can be both bullshit <em>and</em>, well, magic. Or at least a work of art. All it takes is undying passion and dedication. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060712/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF76qlwWM8s">knowing Nikola Tesla</a>. </p>

<p>A good magician takes a trick, and with a well-worked slight of hand can make you believe. <em>In something.</em> Something that isn&apos;t your day-to-day routine. Something that strips your brain of knowledge and facts and science, and leaves you with only mystical, otherworldly beauty. Even if just for one fleeting moment.</p>

<p>Enter: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630060712/http://www.justinsightmagic.com/">this possibly blind magician</a> working his schtick in the bowels of our mass transit system.
