	<p>It&apos;s Hot Dog Season! And the Brooklyn Diner (located in Times Square...) dedicated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621083826/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/brooklyn_diner_perfect_place_to_bre.php">its famous 15-bite All Beef Hot Dog</a> to Brooklyn-born Tony-nominated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621083826/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/14/harvey_fierstei_1.php">Harvey Fierstein</a> yesterday. Why? Something about it being the 30th anniversary of his first Tony nomination <em>but that doesn&apos;t really even make sense</em>, so we think it&apos;s just because the world needed more humorous hot dog photos&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621083826/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/13/michele_bachmann_enjoys_leading_iow.php">it&apos;s been a while</a> since Michelle Bachmann went to that state fair.   </p>

<p>So click through for a look at Fierstein and many, many giant hot dogs. Those people surrounding him are audience members from yesterday&apos;s matinee performance of <em>Kinky Boots</em>. </p>

<p>The 15-Bite Brooklyn Diner Harvey Hot Dog (as it is now called) costs $18.50, and is served on a brioche bun with a side of frizzled onion rings, warm juniper berry sauerkraut, and pickled relish.</p>
