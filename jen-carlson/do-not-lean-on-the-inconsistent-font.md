<p>After we covered the grammatically-busted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000019/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/09/subway_typo.php">Brodaway sign</a> on Brooklyn&apos;s G platform yesterday, a number of font-philes questioned the typography in many &quot;Do Not Lean&quot; decals adorning subway doors. NYC Transit&apos;s Paul Fleuranges tells us that while &quot;customers see fit to vandalize&quot; signs, this particular error could be blamed on the car builder. He explained:</p><blockquote>We did have a recent problem with a car builder who took it upon themselves to manufacture and apply subway car decals without the prior approval of NYC Transit. The cars were delivered to NYC Transit with the wrong decals. They have since been instructed not to do so going forward, and those that were applied in error will be replaced with NYC Transit approved and manufactured decals.</blockquote>For an extensive history on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000019/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/30/subway_font_porn.php">subway fonts</a>, there&apos;s an interesting article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000019/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-mostly-true-story-of-helvetica-and-the-new-york-city-subway?pp=1">here</a>.<p></p>
