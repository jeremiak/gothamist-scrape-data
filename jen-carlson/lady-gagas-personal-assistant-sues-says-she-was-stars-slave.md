										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="gagamonster1211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420035418im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gagamonster1211.jpg" width="350" height="245"> <br> <i>via the AP</i></div> Merry Christmas, Lady Gaga: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420035418/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/was_gaga_slave_IyvXjE3n412CoMqKQnyS1L?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> has a special exclusive dedicated to you today! The paper reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420035418/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">the performer</a> is a &quot;monster to work for,&quot; at least according to her former personal assistant, Jennifer O&apos;Neill. <p></p>

<p>After 13 months of working for the star, the 41-year-old O&apos;Neill is suing for hundreds of thousands of dollars. While on payroll, she handled Gaga&apos;s schedule, finances, food, and anything else she needed, day or night. The court papers go into more detail, saying she ensured &quot;the promptness of a towel following a shower and serving as a personal alarm clock to keep [Gaga] on schedule... with no breaks for meals or, at times, even sleep.&#x201D; Which... kind of sounds like the job description of a personal assistant? </p>

<p>Anyway, O&apos;Neill, who made $75,000/year, filed suit in Manhattan Federal Court last week against Gaga&apos;s Mermaid Touring Company (meaning Gaga herself isn&apos;t a defendant), claiming she&apos;s owed $380,000 for 7,168 hours of unpaid overtime. She&apos;s also seeking more for unspecified damages. This follows her former personal assistant&apos;s claims (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420035418/http://www.amazon.com/Poker-Face-Rise-Lady-Gaga/dp/1401324096/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324835993&amp;sr=8-1">in this book</a>) that she had to sleep with, and sometimes shower with Gaga on most nights because the star refused to be alone.</p>

<p>Gaga&apos;s camp says the lawsuit is &#x201C;completely without merit.&#x201D;</p>
