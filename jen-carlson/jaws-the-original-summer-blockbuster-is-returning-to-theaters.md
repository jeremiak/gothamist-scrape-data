<p>On June 20th, 1975, America was given the gift of exactly 124 minutes of perfect summer movie magic. Before <em>Jaws</em>, we didn&apos;t even have these big flashy summer flicks&#x2014;making it not only the greatest, but the prototypical summer blockbuster. And now, <em>duunnn dunnn</em>, Jaws is back on the big screen. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820124206/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/19/crush_the_same_can_that_captain_qui.php">Crush a Narragansett Beer can</a> and celebrate.</p>

<p>When <em>Jaws</em> hit theaters the first time around, new director Steven Spielberg was 29 years old, and had only just directed his first theatrical film (<em>The Sugarland Express</em>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820124206/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jaws-1975">Roger Ebert declared</a> it to be a &quot;sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it&apos;s populated with characters that have been developed into human beings we get to know and care about. It&apos;s a film that&apos;s as frightening as <em>The Exorcist</em>, and yet it&apos;s a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun.&quot; He goes on to say that this Spielberg fella &quot;is very good.&quot; Indeed. </p>

<p>One of the best scenes doesn&apos;t involve a shark at all, but a boy mimicking his father. While the fish may have hooked you into the theater, the story often lies elsewhere&#x2014;you can&apos;t <em>just</em> have a shark. J.J. Abrams has called scenes like this the ones that live &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820124206/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpjVgF5JDq8">inside the box</a>.&quot; It is why <em>Sharknado</em> is a joke, and <em>Jaws</em> is a masterpiece. </p>
