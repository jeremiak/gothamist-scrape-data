<span class="photo_caption">&quot;Now me and my loser friends are gonna head out to buy Aerosmith tickets. Top priority of the summer.&quot;</span></p>

<p>The outdoor summer concert lineups keep coming in, so let&apos;s see how things are shaping up. So far we&apos;ve gotten announcements from the L Magazine&apos;s Northside Festival, the Williamsburg Waterfront concerts (now at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142000/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/welcome_to_williamsburg_park.php">Williamsburg Park</a> and called The LACOSTE L!VE Concert Series), the ol&apos; standby SummerStage, and Celebrate Brooklyn. And it&apos;s kind of nice we don&apos;t have to take a <em>slow ride</em> to see any of the bands playing...</p>

<p><strong>NORTHSIDE FESTIVAL</strong><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142000/http://gothamist.com/tags/northsidefestival">The Northside Festival</a> has already delivered an amazing photo op <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142000/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/brooklyn_borough_president_marty_ma.php">with GZA and a rapping Marty Markowitz</a>, but they&apos;re really outdoing themselves this year! They just announced some more of the lineup for the fest, which takes place around Williamsburg and Greenpoint from June 14th through 21st, and this is shaping up to be their best year yet. </p>

<p>All in all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142000/http://www.northsidefestival.com/">they&apos;ll bring in 350 bands</a>, nearly 40 films, over 100 artists, and take over 30 venues... including Williamsburg Park (for the outdoor concert space&apos;s inaugural show) at 50 Kent Avenue. That show will go down on Friday, June 15th and features Of Montreal, Jens Lekman, The Thermals, and Beach Fossils. Interesting booking? Individual tickets are $33.50 and go on sale Friday at noon here, and we&apos;re particularly looking forward to some Thermals on a hot summer day (even if a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142000/https://twitter.com/johndelsignore">certain Gothamist staffer</a> calls them: &quot;Fugazi lite, the Coldplay of punk.&quot;)</p>

<p>Next up, former Wu Tang-member and Brooklyn-native GZA will be performing Liquid Swords with Grupo Fantasma at an early show (which is sold out) and a late show (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510142000/http://www.musichallofwilliamsburg.com/event/118315">tickets on sale here</a>) on Thursday, June 14th at Music Hall of Williamsburg.<br>
 <br>
Other bands you&apos;ll be hearing at the fest include Ultramagnetic MC&apos;s, Ceremony, Tinariwen, Starfucker, Kool Keith, The Felice Brothers, D&#xE2;m-Funk, Future of the Left, Screaming Females, Asobi Seksu, Keith Fullerton Whitman, Crystal Stilts, Beach Fossils, Mucca Pazza, Chain and the Gang, Frankie Rose, Grass Widow, Buke and Gass, V&#xE5;r (members of Iceage in their first U.S. show), These United States, Neil Hamburger, Pontiak, Amen Dunes, Eternal Summers, and Kid Sister.<br>
 </p>

<p><strong>WILLIAMSBURG PARK</strong><br>
On top of the inaugural show during the Northside Fest, the OSA has put together some more great shows, both free and ticketed. On July 19th Eugene Mirman and some friends will be delivering on the comedy front, along with Ok Go! for a free show. On August 10th there&apos;s &quot;An Evening with CAKE&quot; ($35). On August 15th there&apos;s My Morning Jacket with Shabazz Palaces (for a whopping 50 bucks). And on August 24th there&apos;s Cypress Hill and Sublime (also $50)... but will there be a hologram Bradley Nowell?</p>

<p><strong>CELEBRATE BROOKLYN!</strong><br>

You&apos;ll also get Lyle Lovett (August 11th), and the Lyricist Lounge 20th Anniversary featuring Ghostface Killah / Camp Lo / Astro and more (June 23). Things really kick off on June 5th with a free show from Jimmy Cliff. </p>
