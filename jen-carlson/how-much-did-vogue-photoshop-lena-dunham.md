<p>Every woman in a glossy magazine has been Photoshopped; that is, unfortunately, the mass media phantasmagoria we live in. So when it was announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> would get the cover treatment in Vogue, the unfortunate first question to pop up was: how much will Wintour&apos;s team Photoshop a woman who doesn&apos;t meet their emaciated fat-free cookie-cutter standards? The photos from the spread have now been released, and while they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/15/ralph_lauren.php">didn&apos;t bobblehead her</a>, some believe they did overuse the retouching tool (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://jezebel.com/lena-dunhams-long-rumored-vogue-cover-is-here-1501856298">Jezebel</a> also points out that they took an arm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/lena-dunham-the-new-queen-of-comedys-first-vogue-cover/?mbid_social_LD#/magazine-gallery/lena-dunham-february-2014/3">out of one shot</a>). </p>

<p>Some of the mixed opinions may be coming from the <em>look</em> of the spread overall: Annie Leibovitz photographed this, and the style is a bit luminous and unreal. A conversation:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/https://twitter.com/kristinamonllos">Kristina Monllos</a>:</strong> So much Photoshop [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/lena-dunham-the-new-queen-of-comedys-first-vogue-cover/?mbid_social_LD">in Lena Dunham&apos;s Vogue spread</a>] that it&apos;s offensive<br>
<strong>Jen Carlson:</strong> I was wondering about that&#x2014;how much they would do<br>
<strong>Kristina:</strong> They really fucked with her body, and of course they use a close up of her face for the cover. I just can&apos;t... I can&apos;t anymore. Magazines are too predictably awful. People on my Facebook feed were already talking about how they need that &quot;Photoshop diet.&quot; The one where she&apos;s being carried by Adam... So, you put a ton of crazy feathers on a person, so we don&apos;t notice her &quot;offensive&quot; size, and then shrink her in Photoshop. Cool, cool... great message.<br>
<strong>Jen:</strong> I can&apos;t really see it that much though&#x2014;she always looks tiny in comparison to Adam... and she kind of is tiny! When I&apos;ve seen her in person and she&apos;s wearing normal clothes and not the intentionally ill-fitting clothes on the show. I feel like for anyone else they would have &apos;shopped this way more, so Dunham may have had some control. Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/lena-dunham-the-new-queen-of-comedys-first-vogue-cover/?mbid_social_LD#/magazine-gallery/lena-dunham-february-2014/4">her wrists where they bend here</a>? That would have normally been reduced on someone else.</p>

<p>At the very least we can all agree that Photoshop is being used for too much evil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/31/anthony_weiner_and_citi_bike_friend.php">and not enough Weiner</a>, and that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310071424/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/lena-dunham-the-new-queen-of-comedys-first-vogue-cover/?mbid_social_LD#/magazine-gallery/lena-dunham-february-2014/2">the pigeon photo</a> is pretty dope.</p>
