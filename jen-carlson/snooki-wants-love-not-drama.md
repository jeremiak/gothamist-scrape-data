Well, that&apos;s what she&apos;s saying, anyway. She told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328120330/http://www.okmagazine.com/2009/12/jersey-shores-snooki-tells-all/">OK! Magazine</a>, &quot;People think I&apos;m all about partying, but I&apos;m not. I&apos;m chill. I stay away from drama.&quot; Maybe that&apos;s why she&apos;s not lobbying for another season (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328120330/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/28/jersey_shore_cast_members_are_full.php">in the Hamptons</a>) with J-WOWW; instead, she wants her own dating show called &quot;Snookin&apos; for Love.&quot; Aw. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328120330/http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2536587/mtv_jersey_shores_snooki_wants_her.html">She says</a>, &quot;I want to find my prince. I&apos;d have 27 guys: guidos and juice heads. That&apos;d be heaven!&quot; Eh. She adds, &quot;Every time I&apos;d pick a guy, I&apos;d give them a pickle and we&apos;d eat the pickle at the end.&quot; Well, yeah, that&apos;s just good dating sense.</p>
