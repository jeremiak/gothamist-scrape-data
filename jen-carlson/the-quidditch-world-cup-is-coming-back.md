<p>The autumn air is sneaking its way in, which means school has started up and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116134104/http://www.internationalquidditch.org/worldcup/">the Quidditch World Cup</a> is coming back to New York City. This November 12th and 13th marks the fifth annual event, which will take place on Randall&apos;s Island (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116134104/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/13/quidditch_world_cup_going_down_on_t.php">last year</a>, it was held in Dewitt Clinton Park in Manhattan). The space allows for ten fields, upon which 100 teams will duke it out (about 2,000 participants total)... as of now, they all get bonus points for using Arcade Fire to soundtrack their preview video:</p>

<p>Has anyone ever attended one of these matches? Is it fun even though they can&apos;t, you know, fly? And fun fact: It&apos;s organized by Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe&apos;s son Alex.</p>
