<span class="photo_caption">Family Ties is leaving Netflix. If you want to meet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143252/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlLvS1vH9Tk">Uncle Ned</a>, he&apos;s in Season 2, Episode 14</span></p>

<p>&quot;Most people gaze neither into the past nor the future; they explore neither truth nor lies. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143252/http://store.wasteheadquarters.com/index.php/tv-shortsleeve.html">They gaze at the television</a>.&#x201D; And what better month to do so than hot, humid August. Come on in from the beach, avert your gaze from the lush beautiful landscape that the summer sun has brought, and stare at 2010 rom com <em>Leap Year</em>, coming to Netflix on August 12th. FINALLY! </p>

<p>And that&apos;s not all.. below, scroll through everything that&apos;s about to come and go from the streaming platform. We would like to highlight the fact that A) <em>Family Ties</em> season 1-7 was on Netflix this whole time, and B) <em>Family Ties</em> season 1-7 was is about to be deleted from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143252/http://gothamist.com/tags/netflix">Netflix</a>. And <em>Magnum, PI</em> fans also have just three more days to figure out who Robin Masters is before Netflix pulls it July 30th.</p>
