title: Movin' on Up in Williamsburg
---

	
										<p>For those who can&apos;t decide between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234831/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/01/the_atlantic_is.php">the suburban</a> and the urban lifestyle, there&apos;s a simple solution: build a vinyl-sided house on the top of an old Brooklyn apartment building (which is way better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150708234831/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/16/brooklyns_simpl.php">a trailer on Willoughby Avenue</a>). This gem has been around for a while and is just East of Bedford on the southside of Williamsburg. While its residents most likely enjoy unobstructed city views from their rooftop abode, according to a Google satellite image they have not put any grass or astroturf up there to resemble a backyard...so no croquet or badminton just yet. </p>

<p>We&apos;re wagering this is a legal construction, in which the owner might have roof rights or bought the air rights from the neighboring buildings. Has anyone ever been invited up to one of these urban McMansions?</p>
