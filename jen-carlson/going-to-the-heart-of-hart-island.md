</div></div>					<p>Hart Island is one of those places in New York that many won&apos;t ever see. Part of the Bronx, it&apos;s currently uninhabited, but in the past has been used as a prisoner of war camp, a missile base and has housed a prison and a women&apos;s asylum.</p>

<p>Richard Nickel Jr. of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524225055/http://kingstonlounge.blogspot.com/2008/08/hart-island.html">The Kingston Lounge</a> recently snuck on to the patrolled island (for five hours starting at the creepy hour of 4 a.m.), a risk since any trespassers will be fined $600 and could face a year in prison. The only people allowed are those who have family members buried there. &quot;Since 1869, the island has served as New York&apos;s sixth potter&apos;s field. Approximately 800,000 bodies are buried on the island, making it the largest publicly funded cemetery in the world.&quot; Read more at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524225055/http://www.hartisland.org/">The Hart Island Project</a>.</p>
