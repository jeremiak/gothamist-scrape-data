<p>Last night on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145648/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, the teenage girl in Pete&apos;s driving class asks, &quot;Didn&apos;t you hear about the sniper at the University of Texas today? Just two weeks after those nurses in Chicago... things seem so random, all of a sudden.&quot;  Later, at Pete and Trudy&apos;s dinner party, the incident comes up again, when Megan says, &quot;They said he had a brain tumor, he kept warning everyone.&quot; The sniper they&apos;re referring to is Charles Whitman, and when someone at the dinner table gets his last name wrong, Don corrects them saying, &quot;it&apos;s Whitman&quot; (as in Dick Whitman, Don&apos;s true identity).</p>

<p>Whitman was a student at the University of Texas at Austin, and a former Marine. On August 1st, 1966 he opened fire on the university&apos;s campus, killing 16 people and wounding 32 others&#x2014;he was eventually shot and killed by the Austin Police Department&apos;s Houston McCoy. Prior to the incident, Whitman had killed his wife and mother.</p>

<p>The NY Times heavily covered the incident, which made their front page. In their articles, Whitman was called &quot;the typical American boy.&quot; On the day of the shooting, they wrote: &quot;The tower that today served as a fortress for Charles J. Whitman is the tallest building in Austin, jutting 27 stories above the normally placid campus.... the tower, which houses the university&apos;s library and administrative offices, is the focal point of the campus and its observation deck. This deck, from which the sniper did his shooting, is one of the city&apos;s major attractions.&quot; (Read more about the memorial at the University <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145648/http://austinist.com/2012/04/16/u_texass_tower_garden_memorial_for.php">right here</a>). Later, the paper noted one of his guns was purchased at Sears that morning, and that he told a doctor, he sometimes thought about shooting people.</p>
