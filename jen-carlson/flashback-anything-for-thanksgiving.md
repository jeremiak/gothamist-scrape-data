										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="TGIVINGFLASHBACK.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083427im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/TGIVINGFLASHBACK.jpg" width="640" height="465" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We&apos;ve looked back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083427/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/26/thanksgiving.php">the Thanksgiving ragamuffins</a> before, and here&apos;s another photo we just came across at the Library of Congress&apos;s Flickr page. The sign on the restaurant window says: &quot;Thanksgiving turkey Dinner with Trimmings 40 cents&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083427/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/17/flashback_old_thanksgiving_menu.php">sounds familiar</a>). This was taken between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083427/http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4605955751/">1910 and 1915</a>, and kids in Brooklyn were still asking, &quot;&apos;Anything f&apos; Thanksgiv&apos;n?&quot; through the 1940s.</p>
