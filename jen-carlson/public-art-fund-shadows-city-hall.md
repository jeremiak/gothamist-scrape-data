<p>Last week the Public Art Fund&#x2019;s new exhibition at City Hall Park (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073216/http://www.publicartfund.org/petercoffin">Peter Coffin&#x2019;s</a> Untitled Sculpture Silhouettes), was unveiled. Currently you&apos;ll be able to find 13 monumental silhouettes of iconic artworks around the park (and miniature versions inside City Hall&apos;s lobby), including variations on Rodin&#x2019;s The Thinker, Picasso&#x2019;s She Goat, Michelangelo&#x2019;s David, and one of Sol LeWitt&#x2019;s Incomplete Open Cubes. </p>

<p>They&apos;ll be on display through next May; and dare we say this is a huge upgrade from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073216/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/30/public_art_fund_brings_brick_house.php">the last piece of public art</a> brought to City Hall.</p>
