<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121134254/http://rineeshah.com/">Rinee Shah</a> has created beautiful prints for a series called &quot;Seinfood,&quot; which serves up the sitcom&apos;s food references via illustration. Any <em>Seinfeld</em> fan will be able to get even the most obscure call-outs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121134254/http://seinfood.bigcartel.com/">in the series</a>, but there are so many more missing! What about the muffin tops, or Kenny Rogers Roasters chicken restaurant?</p>

<p>And what about the Mackinaw peaches?!</p>
