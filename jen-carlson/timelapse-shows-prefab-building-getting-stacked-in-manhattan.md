<p>Recently a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821063749/http://gothamist.com/tags/prefab">prefab</a> residential building was stacked up seven-stories high at 4857 Broadway, near Fort Tryon Park... and our future was captured on video. The building, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821063749/http://gluckplus.com/project/the-stack">The Stack</a>, will contain 28 moderate-income rental apartments, housed inside of 56 boxes.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821063749/http://www.fastcodesign.com/1673003/watch-a-new-prefab-building-rise-in-nyc-stack-by-stack">to FastCo</a>, the Inwood building resides in a lot that&apos;s 50-feet-wide and 150-feet-deep and &quot;might be New York&#x2019;s first prefab steel-and-concrete apartment building.&quot; While it&apos;s not completed yet (residents will move in starting in October), they note that in the end this building will have taken six months less to finish than a building using traditional construction methods.</p>
