Late last year a trailer for a full-length fitness DVD was making the rounds on music sites <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005744/http://pitchfork.com/news/44868-that-bon-iver-workout-video-is-real-and-its-part-of-a-full-length-fitness-dvd/">like Pitchfork</a>, featuring an unexpected duo: Justin Vernon and trainer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005744/http://www.rogcity.com/">Jeff Rogers</a>. Vernon and his band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005744/http://gothamist.com/tags/boniver">Bon Iver</a> depend on Rogers, their fitness guru, to get them moving when they&apos;d otherwise be making dents in the couches backstage&#x2014;but Rogers has also been bringing his workouts to the masses. On top of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141015005744/http://www.rogcity.com/shop.html">the aforementioned DVD</a>, he hosts fitness events in his homestate of Wisconsin, and when Bon Iver is in New York City for some shows at Radio City Music Hall next week, they&apos;re bringing Rogers with them... which means New York City will get a chance to work out like Bon Iver. And it will be very different from that <em>other</em> Wisconsinite Paul Ryan&apos;s P90X regime!</p>

<blockquote>Rogers&apos; conditioning techniques incorporate a holistic philosophy of achieving &quot;sound minds, strong bodies and peaceful souls.&quot;  Vernon&apos;s participation in the official DVD for the workout sparked significant chatter among music blogs and news sites earlier this year, prompting some journalists to dub On the Road &quot;the next P90X for the hipster scene,&quot; somewhat ironic given On the Road&apos;s more serene approach to fitness.</blockquote>

<p>Want in? He will be bringing his signature workout event, called Pack the Park, to Hudson Square (at Urban Plaza at Trump) on September 21st and 22nd (from 2 to 3 p.m.). The event is free, but the sessions are limited to 50 participants each&#x2014;<a href="www.rogcity-NYC.eventbrite.com">so register here now</a>!</p>
