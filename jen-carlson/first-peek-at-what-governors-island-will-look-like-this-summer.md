<p>This year&apos;s winning entry inn the City of Dreams Pavilion Competition&#x2014;which allows a designer to bring their creation to Governors Island for the summer&#x2014;has been announced. And it&apos;s (drum roll): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192742/http://newyork.figmentproject.org/long-term-exhibitions/2011-city-of-dreams-pavilion/">Burble Bup</a>! And it sounds as fun as it... sounds. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192742/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/a-summertime-arts-structure-for-governors-island/">Arts Beat</a>, the piece consists of a &quot;dome made from inflatable components and mounds made of soil and bark-filled fabric tubes for sitting and climbing.&quot; You&apos;ll be able to experience it in person starting May 27th, and it will be on the island through September 25th.</p>

<p>A rep for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192742/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/26/david_koren_figment_festival.php">Figment</a> (who transform the island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192742/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/12/figment_1.php">each summer</a>) says it will allow visitors to &#x201C;enjoy the shifting colors as light plays through the translucent skins of the Bups.&#x201D; Which will be really sweet for certain Dave Matthews Band fans, if they&apos;re allowed near it during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192742/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/27/dave_matthews_band_will_take_up_res.php">the fest this summer</a>.</p>
