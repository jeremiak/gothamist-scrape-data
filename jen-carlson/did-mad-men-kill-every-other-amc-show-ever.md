Since then we&apos;ve been focused on the important things, like turning Don Draper into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170414/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/13/jon_hamm.php">a vampire</a> and creating fake situations in which we&apos;d be forced to choose between him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170414/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/don_draper_vs_coach_taylor.php">and Coach Taylor</a>. Summer! But little did we know there was a new war brewing in AMC land.</p>

<p>David Hinckley sums it up over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170414/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2011/08/16/2011-08-16_mad_men_sparks_twitter_argument_between_drama_creator_matt_weiner_sons_of_anarch.html">the Daily News</a>, saying <em>Sons of Anarchy</em> creator Kurt Sutter essentially blamed Weiner for ruining other AMC shows be demanding more money for his own (noteworthy: Sutter&apos;s show is on FX). Sutter, working off of an LA Times piece, basically said &quot;the proposed cuts had caused <em>Breaking Bad</em> producers to consider taking that show away from AMC and had driven show runner Frank Darabont to leave AMC&apos;s <em>The Walking Dead</em>.&quot; He made the declarations on Twitter, which he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170414/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/15/kurt-sutter-quits-twitter/">since quit</a>. </p>

<p><em>Walking Dead</em>&apos;s fanbase have also been Tweeting out their frustrations. But Hinckley thinks everyone needs to calm down, because in the end, <em>Breaking Bad</em> is returning. But what about <em>Walking Dead</em>? A very scientific poll of our office showed that 2 out of 2 people think it&apos;s going to suck now that Darabont is out of the picture. So there may be blood on Weiner&apos;s hands after all.</p>
