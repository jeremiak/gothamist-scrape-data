                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="nighthawks0813.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013429im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/nighthawks0813.jpg" width="640" height="348" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Tonight the Whitney is unveiling a life-size 3D installation which will replicate Edward Hopper&apos;s &quot;Nighthawks &quot;painting. The famous work features a 1940s diner scene, and while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013429/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/nighhawks_diner.php">diner never actually existed</a>, the museum claims the installation (coinciding with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013429/http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/HopperDrawing">their Hopper exhibition</a>) is &quot;in one of the buildings that inspired it&quot;&#x2014;the Flatiron.</p>

<p>The recreation is housed inside the landmarked building, and more specifically in the Flatiron Prow Artspace. Tonight (Thursday) they&apos;ll be unveiling the massive piece and lighting it up at 8:15 p.m. </p>

<p>We&apos;ll have photos tomorrow, and you can see it yourself tonight through October 6th.</p>
