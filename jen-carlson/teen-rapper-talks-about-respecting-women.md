His song and video for &quot;Stop Looking at My Moms&quot;&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311091929/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/12/video_boy_rapper_says_stop_hitting.php">we posted yesterday</a>&#x2014;has now scored him an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311091929/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/14/2010-10-14_teen_rapper_angry_with_guys_ogling_his_ma_has_a_hit_on_youtube_calls_out_catcall.html">the Daily News</a>. The high school freshman (whose real name is Brian Bradley) told the paper, &quot;<strong>I didn&apos;t like the way people were staring at my mother when I walked down the street. It was very offending.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Bradley, who hails from Bed-Stuy, says &quot;I decided instead of being violent, and going about it the wrong way, I&apos;d put it on a record. It&apos;s a track everyone can relate to. I don&apos;t like people lookin&apos; at my moms. I&apos;m pretty sure nobody likes it. Women, they are not pieces of meat. They are human beings. They should be respected. Men should know better.&quot;</p>

<p>Someone raised their son the right way! As for his mom, she was too shy to give her name to the paper, but told them, &quot;It shows that he loves his mom, and he knows what it means to respect a woman.&quot; Bradley has been performing since he was 10, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311091929/http://www.myspace.com/theastronomicalkid">his next gig</a> is opening for Fabolous at Pace University.</p>
