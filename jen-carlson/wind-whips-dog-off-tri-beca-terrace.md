The dog just has a few bruises and sore paw from his adventure, and Lindenauer says, &#x201C;I call him my miracle dog.&quot; Turns out a neighbor saw the dog running around in the rain on the roof it landed on, and brought him back to the building. At the time of the May 3rd incident Lindenauer was at the grocery store, and insists her Alfie didn&apos;t jump, saying, &quot;I&#x2019;m thinking that wind just took him.&quot; Yeah, we&apos;ll smoke what she&apos;s having.
