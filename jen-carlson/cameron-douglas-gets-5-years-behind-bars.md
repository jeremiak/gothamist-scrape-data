(AP Photo)</i></div> Yesterday 31-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927122300/http://gothamist.com/tags/camerondouglas">Cameron Douglas</a>, the son of actor Michael Douglas, received a sentencing of five years in prison after being busted on some drug-related charges (like that time he was caught with half-a-pound of crystal meth at the Gansevoort Hotel). In January he pleaded guilty to possession of heroin (while under house arrest), and distribution of methamphetamines and cocaine.<p></p>

<p>On top of the five years behind bars, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927122300/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/nyregion/21douglas.html?ref=nyregion">the NY Times</a> reports that Douglas will also undergo five years of supervision after release. In the courtroom yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927122300/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cameron_douglas_statement_u1aR1uTgc0hH8AllX1ukJI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">he proclaimed</a>, &quot;If I would be so fortunate as to have another chance, I would never squander that opportunity.&quot; This plea followed written ones by his family in recent weeks, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927122300/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20002916-504083.html">five-page diatribe</a> from his famous father in which he said, &quot;I have some idea of the pressure of finding your own identity with a famous father. I&apos;m not sure I can comprehend it with two generations to deal with.&quot;</p>

<p>Cameron&apos;s mother Diandra, and his dad were both in attendance at the sentencing yesterday.</p>
