From Central Park Summerstage to the Seaport to McCarren Pool (RIP), there&apos;s no shortage of outdoor music venues during the summer months. But now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135908/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05302009/entertainment/stagefight_171608.htm">the NY Post</a> is pitting them against each other! They say that while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135908/http://www.summerstage.org/">Summerstage</a> used to be &quot;a magnet for denizens of the five boroughs, as well as hordes of tourists,&quot; its reign may be challenged as people are beginning to voice complaints of it &quot;being too hot, too crowded, too greedy.&quot; <p></p>

<p>While the venue does offer some free shows, the big names will cost you. However, over in Prospect Park, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135908/http://www.briconline.org/celebrate">Celebrate Brooklyn!</a> series offers up some major headliners (David Byrne, for instance) for a mere suggested donation. And at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135908/http://seaportmusicfestival.com/">Seaport Music Festival</a>, <em>all</em> of the shows are free, as are the Pool Parties which will likely be relocated to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135908/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/27/pool_concerts_on_the_east_river.php">Williamsburg waterfront</a>. Do we even have a right <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135908/http://whitewhine.tumblr.com/">to complain</a> when there are so many choices?</p>
