<p>A decade ago they told him &quot;further study&quot; was required, after they discovered it was a 19th century structure, not 18th. What is known now: the Hubbard House was built sometime between 1830 and 1835 (with a two-story wing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184114/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/tour33/33.html">added in 1925</a>), it is listed on the national and stage registers for historic places, and it is &quot;one of the few Dutch-American houses in New York City retaining its original orientation on its original site with sufficient surrounding property to give some sense of its original setting.&quot; Antonides has also restored the house, thanks to a $50,000 grant and a low-interest loan from the NY Landmarks Conservancy; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184114/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/gravesend/gravesend.html">Forgotten-NY</a> has photos of the before and after. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184114/http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Town/dutch/hubbard.html">Here is more on the history</a> of the Hubbard House.</p>

<p>In 1950 there were 70 farmhouses still standing, today there are only 13, and of those, 4 are not landmarked. In 2003, the Van Pelt-Woolsey House was flattened to make way for condos, after standing strong since 1791. Antonides would simply like to make sure the same thing doesn&apos;t happen with his home, though no specific or immediate threat was mentioned. </p>
