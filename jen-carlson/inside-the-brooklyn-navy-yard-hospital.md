</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s some amazing photographic documentation of the current state of the Brooklyn Navy Yard&apos;s Hospital Complex (known also as the Annex) over at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203211105/http://kingstonlounge.blogspot.com/2009/02/brooklyn-navy-yard-hospital-complex.html">Kingston Lounge</a>. </p>

<p>A little history lesson: Allegedly the land that the hospital was built on was sold in 1824, turning what was the Schenck Farm over to the secretary of the Navy. Construction began in 1830, and by 1850 &quot;the Annex was a self-contained parcel of land, walled-in, with a gatehouse, a laboratory, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203211105/http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Cemetery/Navy.Ceme.html">a cemetery</a>. During the Civil War, the hospital would supply over one third of the medicines used by Union troops, and the basement of the main hospital building would be used to confine and treat wounded Confederate prisoners.&quot; </p>
