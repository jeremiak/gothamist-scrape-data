title: Violent Femmes Are Playing Central Park This Week
---

	
										<p>Violent Femmes are a band that have been appreciated by many over the decades (even our youthful interns know them!), and for a small group that appreciation probably stemmed from, or was rejuvenated by, that time fictional band Hey That&apos;s My Bike covered their hit, &quot;Add It Up&quot;:</p>

<p>But even if Troy Dyer&apos;s rendition hurt so good&#x2014;and sort of made you wonder why you&apos;re attracted to assholes?&#x2014;the original is still worlds better:</p>

<p>Oh god, and this one: </p>

<p>So good news: there are still tickets left to see the band play their first NYC show since 2004, which is happening tomorrow, September 12th. Their show is at Central Park&#x2019;s Rumsey Playfield, and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140043/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/00004AAAC301CC71">get your tickets here</a>.</p>

<p>While the band still features Gordon Gano and Brian Ritchie, Brian Viglione of the Dresden Dolls has replaced original drummer Victor DeLorenzo. Apparently there was some sort of split in 2009 over their hit &#x201C;Blister In The Sun,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140043/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/violent-femmes-to-play-debut-album-in-central-park-20130911">he officially quit</a> after they reunited at Coachella this year.</p>

<p>And here&apos;s the band&apos;s appearance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140043/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/revisiting_1980s_music_tv_new_york.php">on New York Hot Tracks</a>, from nearly 30 years ago: </p>
