                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="kimdeal0613.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131126090409im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/kimdeal0613.jpg" width="350" height="331"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> (Getty Images)</i></div> This morning, the Pixies announced on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131126090409/https://www.facebook.com/pixiesofficial/posts/10151715659192442">Facebook page</a> that founding member Kim Deal has left the band, but gave little insight into why: <p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;We are sad to say that Kim Deal has decided to leave the Pixies. We are very proud to have worked with her on and off over the last 25 years. Despite her decision to move on, we will always consider her a member of the Pixies, and her place will always be here for her. We wish her all the best.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The note was signed by the remaining members:  Black Francis, Joey Santiago and David Lovering, all of whom are familiar with band breakups and shakeups. The three are clearly sticking together and leaving the door open for their longtime bandmate. </p>

<p>The last time the Pixies toured was in 2011, and recently Deal has been focusing on The Breeders again, a band she formed with her sister Kelley during the Pixies 1990s breakup. They just celebrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131126090409/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/29/the_breeders_are_playing_brooklyn_i.php">the 20th anniversary of <em>Last Splash</em></a>.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s go back to happier times&#x2014;here are the Pixies in 1988, a then youthful band, playing &quot;Hey&quot;... still one of the Best Songs Ever.</p>
