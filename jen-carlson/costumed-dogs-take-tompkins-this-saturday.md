&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s almost Halloween, which means it&apos;s time for humans to dress their dogs in costumes so we can &lt;em&gt;oooh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ahhh&lt;/em&gt; over them. This Saturday is the 20th Annual Tompkins Square &lt;a href=" http:="" www.dogster.org="" "="">Halloween Dog Parade</a>. The event will take place from noon to 3 p.m., and this year there&apos;s even going to be a photo booth area in the dog run, which will act as a red carpet for the pups. If past attendance is any indication, expect about 500 dogs in costumes! If you make it over there, be sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230203148/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr. Let&apos;s see if these dogs can give <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230203148/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/cat_fashion_show.php">the cats</a> a run for their money.</span></p>
