At the time, NYC Transit&apos;s Paul Fleuranges told us about a new campaign coming up, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915040756/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/please-give-the-disabled-your-seat-or-else/">CityRoom</a> points out that it&apos;s launched. With a firmer tone than the ads have had in the past, the new posters remind straphangers that not all disabilities are visible, and declare that giving up one&apos;s seat is &quot;not only polite, it&#x2019;s the law.&quot; Fleuranges commented that &quot;It&apos;s the first time we&apos;ve really stressed this,&quot; and warned that those who won&apos;t give up their seat on request will face up to a $50 fine.  But with robotic trains, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915040756/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/19/agents.php">slimmed down staff</a>, and no one on hand to even gauge the effectiveness of the campaign, how will it even be enforced on subways?</p>
