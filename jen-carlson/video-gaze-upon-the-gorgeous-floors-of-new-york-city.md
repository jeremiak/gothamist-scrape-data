<p>There is a saying that real New Yorkers never look up. That isn&apos;t true. There&apos;s a lot of cool, historic stuff above us and if you aren&apos;t looking up at it, you should be. Real New Yorkers look in any goddamn direction they want to, including up and including down... and today we&apos;re going to contemplate that downward gaze. </p>

<p>Real New Yorkers look down just as much as they look up, and for the same reasons: there&apos;s some worthwhile stuff down there. Sure, sometimes there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063532/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/possibly_the_saddest_thing_ever_rat.php">terrible and sad things</a> on the ground, but you can&apos;t let the fear take hold of you, as you&apos;ll run the risk of missing out on something beautiful. There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063532/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/09/hess_triangle_history.php">tiny plots of land that hold big stories</a>, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063532/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/29/sidewalk_clock_nyc.php">old, historic clocks</a>, and there is tile that you almost don&apos;t even want to step on. </p>

<p>Below, a quick cut to show you some of what&apos;s down there, courtesy of the fantastic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063532/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ihavethisthingwithfloors/">#ihavethisthingwithfloors</a> hashtag. These are all floors (and sidewalks) around NYC&#x2014;from the Met, to the High Line, to Bowery Hotel, to the AMNH, to Dough, to the Empire State Building and beyond...</p>
