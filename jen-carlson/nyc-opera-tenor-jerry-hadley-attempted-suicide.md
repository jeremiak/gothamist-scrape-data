This morning it&apos;s being reported that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180031/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/arts/music/12singer.html">isn&apos;t expected to survive</a>. Last year the 55-year old was arrested on Riverside Drive in Manhattan for driving while intoxicated, and even though the case was dropped - he had other problems to deal with. More recently, despite his success, Hadley had been filing for bankruptcy, was concerned about his career and was being treated for depression.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning at 7am he shot himself in the head with an air rifle just outside of Poughkeepsie, NY - and is currently brain damaged and on life support. After a woman who lived with him heard the shot she called the police, who found him on his bedroom floor.</p>

<p>Hadley had a successful career, which really began when he was discovered by the late <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180031/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/03/beverly_sills_1.php">Beverly Sills</a> in 1978 at the National Opera Institute auditions, she was the general director of the New York City Opera at the time and offered him a contract on the spot. His accomplishments, on top of being a part of Emmy and Grammy award winning projects, include creating the title role in composer John Harbison&apos;s &quot;Great Gatsby&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. He did the same as the lead in Paul McCartney&apos;s &quot;Liverpool Oratorio,&quot; and Leonard Bernstein selected him to sing the main part the musical &quot;Candide.&quot; Since he was on his way to making a comeback, many close to him are baffled by his actions on Tuesday.</p>
