<p>People are still doing Chatroulette, and people are still listening to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160814105430/http://gothamist.com/tags/callmemaybe">Call Me Maybe</a>&quot;&#x2014;it&apos;s probably best not to dwell on what this all means about us as a people, and instead just embrace that the two have finally come together in a most perfect union. The below video shows an oft bikini-clad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160814105430/http://www.youtube.com/user/SteveKardynal">Steve Kardynal</a> surprising Chatroulette participants with their own personal lip dub performance of the Carly Rae Jepsen song. There are costume changes, there is air humping, there are horrified reactions... Enjoy:</p>
