Red Hook is still trying to recover from the storm, and now they&apos;ve got the extra obstacle of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220117/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/15/trailer_1.php#photo-1">Will Smith and his massive trailer</a> in the way. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220117/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/crowe_tale_of_klyn_woe_JNqQ0FTm4kxV8ijh7gGeuM">the NY Post</a>, <em>Winter&#x2019;s Tale</em> (which also stars Jennifer Connelly, Russell Crowe and Colin Farrell) was supposed to be done shooting in the neighborhood around Thanksgiving, but they&apos;re still there causing chaos. One resident told the paper, <strong>&quot;The crew&#x2019;s taking up all the parking spaces on the streets that residents and business owners desperately need to help the area dig out and recover.&quot;</strong> So what&apos;s causing the delay? Look no further than Russell Crowe&#x2014;&quot;the crew says it will be longer because Crowe didn&#x2019;t show up for filming last week. When I asked when it would be done, the answer was, &apos;As long as it takes Russell to film.&apos;&quot; The official word, however, is that Sandy screwed up everyone&apos;s schedules, forcing them to extend filming in the area.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, the parking lot at the damaged Fairway (now shuttered until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220117/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/09/red_hook_fairway_wont_reopen_until.php">sometime next year</a>) is serving as a craft services area for the film&apos;s cast and crew.</p>
