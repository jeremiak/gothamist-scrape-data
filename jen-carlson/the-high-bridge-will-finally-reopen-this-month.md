</div></div>					<p>The High Bridge has been closed to the public for 40 years (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030041329/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/photos_high_bridge_harlem.php#photo-1">aside from a few tours</a>), but will soon reopen. Very soon: on June 9th. The bridge (which recently got the children&apos;s book treatment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030041329/http://bronx.news12.com/news/sesame-street-star-writes-high-bridge-children-s-book-1.10495508">from <em>Sesame Street</em>&#x2019;s Maria</a>) spans the Harlem River to connect the area around West 170th Street in the Bronx to the area around West 173rd Street in Manhattan. It&apos;s part of the Old Croton Aqueduct, which brought NYC its clean water, and first opened in 1848&#x2014;some declare it to be &quot;The Original High Line.&quot;</p>

<p>The pedestrian bridge (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030041329/http://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/highbridge-park/high-bridge-history">NYC&apos;s oldest standing bridge</a>!) will finally reopen on June 9th, about 6 years after anticipated&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030041329/http://www.welcome2thebronx.com/wordpress/2015/06/04/the-original-high-line-the-high-bridge-to-reopen-this-tuesday-june-9th/">Welcome2theBronx</a>, they have &quot;been building for years for this landmark to reopen and connect the neighborhoods. At over 2,000 feet in length, it isn&#x2019;t anywhere near as long as the High Line in Manhattan but at almost 140 feet in height it more than towers above the city offering incomparable views.&quot;</p>
