When a teenage boy mugged him at knife point on the subway platform one of those nights, Diaz offered him his jacket and changed the course of things.</p><blockquote>As the teen began to walk away, Diaz told him, &quot;Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something. If you&apos;re going to be robbing people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep you warm.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The would-be robber looked at his would-be victim, &quot;like what&apos;s going on here?&quot; Diaz says. &quot;He asked me, &apos;Why are you doing this?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Diaz replied: &quot;If you&apos;re willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars, then I guess you must really need the money. I mean, all I wanted to do was get dinner and if you really want to join me ... hey, you&apos;re more than welcome.</p>

<p>&quot;The manager comes by, the dishwashers come by, the waiters come by to say hi,&quot; Diaz says. &quot;The kid was like, &apos;You know everybody here. Do you own this place?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I just eat here a lot,&quot; Diaz says he told the teen. &quot;He says, &apos;But you&apos;re even nice to the dishwasher.&apos;&quot;</p></blockquote>Needless to say, the kid gave Diaz his wallet back...but he also handed over the knife he used to mug him. So maybe, just maybe, he&apos;s found a new way to make some money. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529060231/http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/03/15338.html">Kottke</a>]<p></p>
