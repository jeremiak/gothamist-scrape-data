---

<p>Oscar the Grouch has predicted the Oscar winners, all the way from his garbage can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514102614/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/visiting_sesame_street.php">on Sesame Street</a>.

But then I found out the Oscar was a Hollywood movie award, and I was thrilled... after all, Hollywood puts out some of the greatest trash I&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; <em>Burn</em>.</p>

<p>He doesn&apos;t have anything to say about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514102614/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/oscar_hosts.php">our hosts</a>, but <em>does</em> pick James Franco for a win. Always knew we&apos;d get along with this guy. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514102614/http://video.aol.com/video/youve-got-oscar-the-grouch/2941910561">AOL</a>]</p>
