<p>If you wake up very early in the morning, before the sun rises or the city&apos;s coffee carts are out, you can see some pretty big names in mainstream music. For free. In the most beautiful park in the universe! IN SUMMERTIME. That&apos;s kind of nice.</p>

<p>This summer&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114220/http://gmaconcerts.com/">Central Park lineup</a> from <em>Good Morning America</em> was announced today, and includes early morning performances from the likes of Sia, Blink 182, and Demi Lovato (who my colleague Rebecca Fishbein typed to me, &quot;IS REALLY GREAT I DON&#x2019;T CARE WHO JUDGES ME&quot;). <em>Something for everyone.</em></p>

<p>You may be cringing at the early hour or at network television or at my colleague&apos;s music preferences, but these early morning concerts are kind of surreal and fun&#x2014;we attended one at Rockefeller Plaza for the TODAY Show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114220/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/09/fleetwood_mac_today_show.php">because Fleetwood Mac</a>, and would recommend it if you like the artist enough. <br>
 <br>
To attend the GMA shows, you just have to show up around 6 a.m. unless the event is ticketed. The series starts on May 20th in Rumsey Playfield, and here&apos;s the full lineup (hashtags <em>theirs</em>):<br>
 <br>
