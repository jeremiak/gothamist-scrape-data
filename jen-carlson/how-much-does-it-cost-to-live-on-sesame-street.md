<p>Elmo recently answered some questions about Sesame Street in a long Q&amp;A; with fans of the show (seen below), and we <em>finally</em> find out how to get to the famous street! Well, sort of. When asked, Elmo says taking &quot;a plane, a bus, a subway&quot; should get you there (when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022200703/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/visiting_sesame_street.php">we visited</a>, we took the N)&#x2014;and if you like it so much you want to stay, Elmo takes his best guess at what his parents paid to own a home there. He declared: &quot;They must have bought the place... for probably a gazillion dollars. Do you know if it&apos;s a buyer&apos;s market or a seller&apos;s market on Sesame Street? Elmo heard mommy and daddy talking about that.&quot;</p>

<p>So, how much would it cost to live on the street? Pictured are some of the locals residences, including Elmo&apos;s parents apartment, Oscar the Grouch&apos;s garbage can, and Big Bird&apos;s nest. The neighborhood is fictional, but the show was aimed to &quot;attract inner-city viewers, so they reproduced these viewers&apos; neighborhoods as its setting&#x2014;a realistic city street, complete with peeling paint, alleys, front stoops, and metal trash cans along the sidewalk.&quot; Last year, however, Bloomberg placed it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022200703/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/10/sesame_street_1.php?gallery0Pic=11#gallery">on the Upper West Side</a>.</p>
