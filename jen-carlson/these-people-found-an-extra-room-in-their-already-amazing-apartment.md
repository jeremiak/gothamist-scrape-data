<p>You know that dream you always have where you find an extra room in your apartment? Well these people, who <em>already had a massive apartment</em>, actually did find an extra room in theirs! Before you click on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151128003808/http://www.cottages-gardens.com/New-York-Cottages-Gardens/March-2013/Michael-Bagley-transforms-a-Manhattan-penthouse-into-a-modern-abode-Image-Gallery/index.php?cp=10&amp;play=false&amp;si=9&amp;view=deluxeslideshow">this Cottages &amp; Gardens photo spread</a>, get into your most Zen mind space and remember that material possessions, square footage, and rooms encircled by terraces <em>are no big deal</em> in the grand scheme of things. Life is so much bigger than all of this overhyped real estate grandeur.</p>

<p>Your 200-square-foot <strike>crawl</strike> living space may not have windows but it&apos;s all you need! It probably feels the same to wake up in this place as it does to wake up on your futon. REMEMBER THAT when you click through to this photo spread showing a landmarked and &quot;elaborately domed penthouse&quot; apartment that is so freaking gorgeous your heart <em>will</em> stop for a few seconds. </p>

<p>The circa-1909 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151128003808/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240_Centre_Street">former police headquarters</a> building may be landmarked, but your walk-up builds muscle tone AND <em>character</em>. And while this place is probably haunted by the bad-ass ghost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151128003808/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_the_police_commis.php">of Teddy Roosevelt</a> (who obviously floated over there from the former Mulberry Street HQ), the old cat lady that haunts the hot plate area of your kitchenette is <em>just as interesting</em>. Okay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151128003808/http://www.cottages-gardens.com/New-York-Cottages-Gardens/March-2013/Michael-Bagley-transforms-a-Manhattan-penthouse-into-a-modern-abode/">you can click through now</a>.
