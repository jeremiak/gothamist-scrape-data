</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223641/http://www.saveconeyisland.net/">Save Coney Island</a> folk have just released a new rendering, showing the Bank of Coney Island as what they call a Bowery Ballroom-style event and music space. Should their vision become reality, this joint would be named The Banker&apos;s Ballroom&#x2014;however, Thor Equities has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223641/http://amusingthezillion.com/2010/06/14/thors-coney-island-caution-asbestos-removal-at-doomed-bank/">secured a permit</a> to demolish the ol&apos; gal, so this idea may never make it off paper. The 1920s-era bank hasn&apos;t been in operation since the early &apos;90s, and there has been plenty of deterioration inside since that time&#x2014;check out photos at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223641/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=1984">ScoutingNY</a>.</p>

<p>SCI&apos;s spokesman Juan Rivero told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223641/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=5&amp;id=38246">the Brooklyn Eagle</a>, &#x201C;This would not only preserve one of Coney&#x2019;s most attractive and historic structures, but also give new life to the amusement area and contribute to its revitalization. Our hope by releasing this rendering is to demonstrate the potential of some of these buildings and how they can be the centerpiece of an extremely vibrant and successful historic neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p>The Bank of Coney Island building was built in 1923 and allegedly many of the original features remain, including &quot;a double height arched entrance flanked by Doric pilasters and capped by a keystone; a denticulated cornice below the attic level; and a stone string course above the attic floor windows.&quot; And that sweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223641/http://www.flickr.com/photos/scoutingny/4552328115/">retro beach wallpaper</a>!</p>
