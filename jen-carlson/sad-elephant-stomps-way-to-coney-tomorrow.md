Tomorrow at noon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150814/http://gothamist.com/tags/peta">PETA</a> will bring their Sad Elephant sculpture to Coney Island in protest of the opening of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus opening there (last year they only brought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150814/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/19/clowning_around_ringing_bros_circus.php?gallery0Pic=20#gallery">a few signs</a>). The statue was created by <em>New Yorker</em> cartoonist Harry Bliss, and its proper name is &quot;Ella PhantzPeril.&quot; It depicts a shackled baby elephant and includes the inscription &quot;See Shackles, Bullhooks, Loneliness&#x2014;All Under the Big Top.&quot; It will remain there all summer.</p>

<p>The organization will also be protesting later in the day, and they tell us they&apos;ve now released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150814/http://www.ringlingbeatsanimals.com/bound-babies.asp">dozens of new images</a> of Ringling&apos;s training center, exposing &quot;how still-nursing baby elephants are captured rodeo-style and dragged away from their loving mothers... wrestled, stretched out, slammed to the ground, gouged with steel-tipped bullhooks, and shocked with electric prods.&quot;</p>

<p>If you want to partake in tomorrow&apos;s sculpture unveiling, it will take place at the intersection of Surf Avenue and West 21st Street. (Don&apos;t forget to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150814/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos or tag them with &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr!)</p>
