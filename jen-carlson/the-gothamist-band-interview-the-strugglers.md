One we pop in the cd player and not only listen to the first song in it&apos;s entirety, but listen to the entire album. In one sitting. Actually, probably the only time this has happened this year is with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094918/http://www.thestrugglers.org/">the Strugglers</a> cd, <em>You Win</em>. <br>
At the center and soul of the band is Randy Bickford, who for all intensive purposes <em>is</em> the Strugglers.  With a voice reminiscent of Eddie Vedder and a flair for songcrafting Bickford manages to create one of the more simplisticly artistic recordings we&apos;ve heard. It&apos;s alt-country and indie rock at it&apos;s best, and we suggest you go check it out live this Saturday. Details after the interview. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
Someone suggested it one night at a party at the turn of the century, and I thought it sounded very fine being a plural moniker for a singular artist.  As such, the name refers to something other than the music-maker(s).      </p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York?</strong><br>
More or less my entire tenure as a New Yorker was a happy time.  Some highlights include eating at Massawa (the best restaurant EVER), discovering Surf Reality, and jogging in Riverside Park.  Aside from 9/11, my least favorite time was the occasional New York Breakdown Moment (i.e., experiencing an already sufficiently traumatic emotional episode which is then rendered practically unendurable by the additional element of NYC noise, speed, traffic, urine stank, etc.).     </p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s your take on playing shows in New York City? If you could play at any venue here, which would it be (past, present...)? </strong><br>
I think NYC concert goers will always be a little more blas&#xE9; about shows and everything else, really.  I think for a long time now the reason for this has partly been a sense of obligation.  New Yorkers are obligated to be blas&#xE9; precisely because they are New Yorkers.  Also, they affect a cynical worldview as a means of survival.  There&#x2019;s something wonderfully Darwinian about living in NYC.  As for venues I&#x2019;d like to play, Carnagie or Radio city.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a difference in the New York music scene from your own local scene? </strong><br>
Carrboro is a small hippie town, and I love it.  Things are more relaxed here in the music scene as in all other aspects.  Also, it&#x2019;s the South.  Which I love but which might not be for everyone.  The constant over-stimulation of the NYC music/art scene is something that&#x2019;s hard to leave behind at first.  But as a wiser feller than me once said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll also never see worse art than you will on the Lower East Side in Manhattan.&#x201D;</p>
