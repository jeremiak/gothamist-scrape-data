<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hagartequlia.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141524im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hagartequlia.jpeg" width="350" height="233" class="image-right"> </span>Move over Jimmy Buffet, Sammy Hagar was in town at La Esquina last night and he brought mucho <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141524/http://www.cabowabo.com/">Cabo Wabo</a> tequila, <em>and</em> his flowing golden curly locks, with him. </p>

<p>Hagar&apos;s main tequila guy, Julio (when asked when he brought Hagar into the fold, he answered, &quot;No, Sammy brought <em>me</em> on&quot;) was also by his side, and schooled those in attendance on what makes a good tequila (something about agave) in a competitive tasting wherein three Cabo Wabo&apos;s were compared with three Patr&#xF3;ns. Secret #1: Sammy sort of liked the Patr&#xF3;n Silver better! </p>

<p>Liquor gives us loose lips, so on to Secret #2: Julio is starting his own tequila distillery and will one day compete with Hagar. It is unclear if the ex-Van Halen front man is aware of this.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, Secret #3: After one or two shots, all tequila tastes the same.</p>
