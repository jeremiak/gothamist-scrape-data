title: Why We Should Just Let Lena Dunham Pose For Vogue If She Wants To

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpJJmUxcPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131107220928im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpJJmUxcPM.jpg" width="640" height="260" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">But what about these magazine covers?

</span></p><p>Should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131107220928/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> pose for <em>Vogue</em>? Does anyone really care if she does or does not except for maybe Anna Wintour? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131107220928/http://nypost.com/2013/11/05/why-lena-dunham-shouldnt-pose-for-vogue/">The NY Post</a>&apos;s Sara Stewart writes today, in her article titled &quot;Why Lena Dunham shouldn&#x2019;t pose for <em>Vogue</em>,&quot; that it was &quot;strange to hear that [Dunham&apos;s] reportedly in talks with Anna Wintour to appear on the cover of <em>Vogue</em>.&quot; But <em>is it really strange?</em> Dunham is a famous writer and actress and a voice of a generation with a &quot;I just don&apos;t give a fuck&quot; style and <em>of course</em> she would be eyed for the cover of <em>Vogue</em>. </p>

<p>And why not do it?</p>

<p>Stewart says Wintour would be using Dunham, because an &quot;insider&quot; told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131107220928/http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2013/10/anna-wintour-hosting-secret-dinner-for-lena-dunham-vogue-cover-girl/">RadarOnline</a> that Wintour would be doing this &quot;even though she doesn&#x2019;t really conform to the body type that <em>Vogue</em> has featured for most of its history.&quot; While it is simply <em>shocking</em> to hear that someone in the fame and fashion industry would use someone, this still isn&apos;t really a good reason to not do it, as Dunham could flip the script and use the opportunity right back.</p>

<p>If Dunham said no, nothing terrible would happen, but nothing would really change, either. Not even temporarily. So why shouldn&apos;t Dunham use the opportunity to change the glossy face of fashion and its celebration of an unrealistic body image? Further, by <em>not</em> doing it Dunham would just keep open the gap between the fashion magazine world&apos;s staggeringly damaging idea of what women should look like... and reality. </p>

<p>We will agree with Stewart that if Dunham were to say yes, she make it her own (though we would not say: &quot;show us what a millennial <em>Vogue</em> would look like,&quot; because that sounds like a nightmarish Thought Catalog fashion spread). She should maybe deny the magazine extreme photoshopping rights, and wear something that at least looks like her natural style.</p>

<p>Anyway, the 27-year-old seems pretty smart and capable of making her own wise decisions without Rupert Murdoch&apos;s rag telling her what to do?</p>
