										<p>A few weeks ago we saw this guy dancing around on Bedford Avenue, attracting a lot of attention. The curious passerby aren&apos;t always human though, even canines want to know what&apos;s up with this dancin&apos; machine! </p>

<p>The questions remain: who is the mystery man, and what exactly is his &quot;message&quot;? </p>
