<p>Brooklyn artist Leon Reid IV launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150727/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leonreid/tourist-in-chief-public-art-installation-by-leon-r">a Kickstarter campaign</a> this month in the hopes of dressing up the George Washington statue in Union Square (as he once did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150727/http://www.woostercollective.com/2009/04/true_yank_installation_by_leon_reid_iv.html">with Abraham Lincoln</a> overseas). Specifically, Reid wanted to add props like an &quot;I &#x2665; NY&quot; hat, a subway map, and local shopping bags to make &quot;a comic reflection of New York&apos;s tourist industry and spark public curiosity as to Washington&apos;s role in New York City history.&quot; Art In Odd Places was hoping to include the piece in their festival in October, and called Reid&apos;s work &quot;very intelligent.&quot; But the city doesn&apos;t think so.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150727/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110727/murray-hill-gramercy/plan-make-union-squares-george-washington-touristinchief-shot-down">DNAInfo</a>, Reid&apos;s Tourist-In-Chief statue isn&apos;t gonna happen, because the Parks Department doesn&apos;t allow dressing up public statues! (Although Gandhi seemed to like his knitwear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150727/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/01/gandhiwarmer.php#photo-1">last year</a>). The agency says they&apos;ve officially denied Reid&apos;s request, but Reid has raised more money than he hoped to via his campaign, so maybe he still has plans to follow through... for now, he&apos;s not talking.</p>
