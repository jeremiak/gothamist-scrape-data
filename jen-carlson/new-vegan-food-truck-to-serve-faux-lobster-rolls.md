<p>A little while ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174341/http://gothamist.com/tags/cinnamonsnail">the Cinnamon Snail</a> food truck owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174341/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151711511539367&amp;set=a.313609224366.145036.274860809366&amp;type=3&amp;theater">posted a photo on Facebook</a>, showing a serendipitous moment where he happened to pull into a service station and park right next to his new competitor: The Green Radish. At the time, the Cinnamon Snail knew nothing of the Green Radish, but seemed to welcome the new vegan truck to the turf (&quot;Lots of luck... May there be more vegan food to choose from in more areas everyday!&quot;). <em>But where is this mysterious Green Radish?</em></p>

<p>We checked in with owner James Rafferty, who told us this morning that New Yorkers can expect him come September, but you can get a sneak peek this month in Brooklyn and New Jersey&#x2014;&quot;We will be at The Montclair Jazz Festival this Saturday, the 17th, and at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174341/http://afropunkfest.com/">The Afropunk Festival</a>, August 24th and 25th.&quot;</p>

<p>Until the truck starts its daily service the first week in September, you can check in on them through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174341/https://www.facebook.com/thegreenradish">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174341/https://twitter.com/thegreenradish1">Twitter</a>&#x2014;where they&apos;ll post their locations when everything is up and runnning. Rafferty told us he hasn&apos;t established a permanent rotation, but is thinking of hitting up the Financial District/Battery Park City, Union Square, and Midtown.</p>

<p>Check out their menu, which looks pretty different from the offerings of the Snail, and even includes a No Lobster Roll ($9)&#x2014;it&apos;s made of mashed chickpeas, vegan mayo, celery, and tarragon... but at press time there is no photographic evidence of this thing that we are now drooling over.</p>
