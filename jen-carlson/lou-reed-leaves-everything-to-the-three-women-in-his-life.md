<p>It&apos;s been a little over a week since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112646/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/lou_reed_is_dead_at_71.php">Lou Reed died</a>, and in this week&apos;s <em>New Yorker</em> Patti Smith has penned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112646/http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2013/11/11/131111ta_talk_smith">a beautiful little tribute</a>&#x2014;&quot;Lou had chosen the perfect day to set sail... the birthday of both Dylan Thomas and Sylvia Plath&#x2014;the day of poets.&quot; It&apos;s a cruel fact of life that the last published words delivered to the world will likely be one&apos;s will, even for a poet like Reed&#x2014;but here we are...</p>

<p>Reed&apos;s will was filed yesterday in Manhattan Surrogate&apos;s Court, and he left everything to his wife, his sister and his mother, who is now 93-years-old. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112646/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131104/west-village/lou-reed-leaves-west-village-hamptons-homes-laurie-anderson">DNAInfo</a>, Laurie Anderson was left the couple&apos;s West Village and East Hampton homes, along with Reed&apos;s art, photographs, jewelry, clothing, automobiles and boats, and his interest in Sister Ray Enterprises (which holds the rights to his songs). However, it&apos;s his longtime business manager and accountant, Robert Gotterer and David Gotterer who were left trustees of his estate, and were directed to collect royalties, negotiate contracts, secure copyrights and licenses.</p>

<p>As for Reed&apos;s sister, Margaret Reed Weiner, she was left 25% of his residuary estate, and $500,000&#x2014;being told: &#x201C;It is my hope and desire, without imposing any legal obligation, that my said sister will use a portion of this cash bequest to help care for our mother, Toby Reed, for the balance of her life.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear what the value of Reed&apos;s estate was at the time of his death, but it goes without saying that his cultural contribution is infinitely more valuable&#x2014;as Smith wrote, &quot;He was our generation&#x2019;s New York poet, championing its misfits as Whitman had championed its workingman and Lorca its persecuted.&quot;</p>
