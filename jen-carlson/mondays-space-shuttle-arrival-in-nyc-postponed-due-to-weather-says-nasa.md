<p>The Space Shuttle Enterprise was set to make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603112236/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/17/reminder_space_shuttle_to_fly_over.php">its grand entrance</a> into NYC with some hot low-flying action over the boroughs on Monday before landing at JFK, but now NASA has announced that it&apos;s been &quot;postponed until further notice due to unfavorable weather forecast.&quot; <em>Buzz(lightyear)kill!</em>  Intrepid reps have told us &quot;a new date will be determined by NASA.&quot;</p>

<p>Officials said that the inclement weather forecast in Washington as well as New York forced the delay. So keep charging those camera batteries until they get the all clear&#x2014;this will be a great photo op when it does happen (check out the photos of the Space Shuttle Discovery&apos;s flyover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603112236/http://dcist.com/2012/04/spacegasm_yep_that_was_a_space_shut.php#photo-1">in Washington D.C.</a>).</p>

<p>In the meantime, the above photo was taken early this morning by the NASA team, when the Enterprise was mounted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603112236/http://www.space.com/15358-space-shuttle-enterprise-carrier-plane.html">to their Shuttle Carrier Aircraft,</a> a modified Boeing 747.</p>
