										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="aanailpolish012411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325190551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/aanailpolish012411.jpg" width="65" height="105" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325190551/http://gothamist.com/tags/americanapparel">American Apparel</a> is on the other side of the lawsuit for once, claiming that a Long Island nail polish maker needs to pony up $5 million! (That&apos;s one way to get out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325190551/http://fashionista.com/2010/08/american-apparel-is-120-million-in-debt-and-might-actually-have-to-file-for-bankruptcy/">debt</a>.) According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325190551/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/america_apparel_seeks_to_nail_li_eVuzoEhjWYpyvV6vbkZPPL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, the Forsythe Cosmetic Group &quot;ruined the launch of its nail polish line by using defective bottles that began &apos;exploding&apos; almost immediately after going on sale.&quot; Sound fun! Except no one saw the potential in polish-splattered deep v-necks, and there may actually be hazardous materials in the polish. Now the cosmetic group is being sued for fraud, product liability, and breach of contract. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325190551/http://www.stylelist.com/2011/01/24/american-apparel-nail-polish-hazardous-material/">Forsyth says</a> this is all &quot;a suspense-novel-worthy chain of melodramatic alleged events.&quot;</p>
