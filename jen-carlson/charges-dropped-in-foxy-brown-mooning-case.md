<p>Last year Foxy Brown violated probation when she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811085133/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/foxy_brown_3.php">mooned her neighbor</a>, Arlene Raymond. Earlier today, however, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice John Walsh dismissed the case, meaning we won&apos;t have to hear about an &quot;underwear defense,&quot; which her lawyer said they were prepared to do. Oh please, some ripped-from-the-headlines crime drama make this happen in the television!</p>

<p>Brown had pleaded not guilty, and said she hadn&apos;t been wearing any underwear that day&#x2014;but her accuser had claimed she had removed them in order to moon her. The case was dropped because Raymond eventually refused to testify&#x2014;the Assistant DA says &quot;she wanted this matter behind her. She wanted to drop the charges.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked if she wore underwear to court, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811085133/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_judge_drops_charge_against_NCXEMSvmB4ol38S2tYl2TI">the NY Post</a> reports that Brown smiled and said &quot;No comment.&quot;</p>
