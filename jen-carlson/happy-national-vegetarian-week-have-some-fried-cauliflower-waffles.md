title: Happy National Vegetarian Week, Have Some Fried Cauliflower & Waffles
---

	
										<p>Today is the first day of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://www.nationalvegetarianweek.org/">National Vegetarian Week</a> (which appears to only be in the UK?) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://www.worldvegetarianweek.com/">World Vegetarian Week</a> (here on Earth)&#x2014;so if you want to celebrate by going meat-free for a week, we have some suggestions for dining out. Vegetarian dishes can go next level when the experts are preparing them. And going meat-free doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t have meat-like substances in your meals&#x2014;they taste better than they sound, promise. Last year we gave you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/03/fake_meat.php">these six spots</a> that serve up fantastic fake meat fare, from tempeh to seitan to soy protein-based meals. Below, some more dishes we&apos;ve spotted on the meat-free menus around town.</p>

<p>Oh, sweet sweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/">Dirt Candy</a> (430 East 9th Street). You&apos;ll pay a little bit more here, but it&apos;s worth it&#x2014;we had dinner there back in 2009 and have dreamed about it since. As Chef Amanda Cohen explained after opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/11/amanda_cohen.php">in 2008</a> there&apos;s even something for people who claim, &quot;I hate vegetarian restaurants.&quot; And currently on their menu that item might just be their take on Chicken &amp; Waffles: <strong>Cauliflower &amp; Waffles</strong>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/?p=2950">The dish contains</a> &quot;buttermilk battered cauliflower, waffles, horseradish, and wild arugula.&quot; It costs $19, but you&apos;ll leave satisfied.</p>

<p>Obviously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/24/finally_the_cinnamon_snail_vegetari.php">we love the Cinnamon Snail truck</a>, and this week they&apos;re parking in the Financial District (today), Midtown East (Tuesday), Midtown West (Wednesday), Flatiron District (Thursday), and Midtown East again on Friday. They&apos;re always changing the menu up, and above you&apos;ll see their <strong>Lemongrass 5-Spice Seitan Sandwich</strong> and a Cinnamon Snail bun. They excel at both savories and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://media.gothamistllc.com/newsletters/gothamist/2012/04/25.php">sweets</a>, so bring an empty stomach when you head over there.</p>

<p>There&apos;s always the old standby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://www.caravanofdreams.net/">Caravan of Dreams</a> (405 East 6th Street), who have hands down the best homemade hummus in town (served with chia chips). One of their mainstay dishes is the <strong>Zucchini and Yellow Squash Spaghetti</strong>, which you can&apos;t go wrong with. This includes Brazil nuts, sesame meatballs, sun-dried tomato marinara, kalamata olives and basil. Bonus: when we were there a few weeks ago they gave each table a delicious and refreshing watermelon based amuse-bouche to start. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142937/http://therethere.net/rd2/index.php?topic=573.0;wap2">Thom Yorke would hit that</a>.</p>
