<p>For some reason, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412181747/http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/02/08/020911-arts-franco-unable-mby/">The Daily</a> has been trying to dash the hopes and dreams of a young man, Mr. James Franco. His lofty ambitions have earned this go-getter movie roles, soap opera roles, published author status, entry into UCLA, NYU, Columbia and Yale (all of which he&apos;s attended), and oh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412181747/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/james_franco_101.php"><em>hello Professor Franco</em></a>. </p>

<p>He was even one of the lucky few to sit across from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412181747/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/10/franco_3.php">Marina Abramovic</a>, whom he also wrote an article about in a little paper called the Wall Street Journal. (James Franco: <em>hard-hitting journalist</em>.) All we&apos;re saying is, you don&apos;t get to host the Academy Awards by resting on your incredibly good looking laurels and flashing that dashing smile every now and again. This is the outcome of hard work... and probably some really good connections. So with either of those, why <em>can&apos;t</em> James Franco become a Rockette if James Franco wanted to become a Rockette (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412181747/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/06/lady_james_franco.php">he might want to</a>!)? </p>

Our money&apos;s on yes. And for the record, the only thing James Franco <em>can&apos;t do</em> is be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412181747/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/07/james_franco_is_a_real_jerk-off.php">the master of his own domain</a>.</p>
