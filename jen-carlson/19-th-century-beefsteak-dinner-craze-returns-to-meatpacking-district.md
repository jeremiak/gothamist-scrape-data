<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104821/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/11/the_beefsteak_dinner_craze_of_the_1.php">we revisited the old Beefsteak Dinner craze</a> of the 19th century. The dinners were &quot;initially all-male gatherings in rustic taverns or dingy cellars where, sitting on crates or stools, they would sing, tell stories, eat steaks, and drink ale with abandon. In these &apos;dungeons,&apos; etiquette was set aside. No knives or forks were allowed. The participants ate tender morsels of beef steak, wiping the grease on large napkins or aprons.&quot;  In recent years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104821/http://brooklynbeefsteak.com/">these dinners have been revived</a> by history (and gluttony) buffs&#x2014;the modern day versions are open to both men and women, but for the most part they&apos;ve kept to tradition.</p>

<p>The Copper Room at Brass Monkey (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104821/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/20/copper_room_now_open_at_meatpacking.php#photo-3">the perfect atmosphere</a> for the dinner&apos;s return) is introducing a Beefsteak dining event series, and tells us they&apos;ll be &quot;putting the silverware away and pulling out the aprons&quot; for the dining events. From their press release:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This indulgent time-honored tradition has returned to The Copper Room (as a monthly series) and Consulting Chef Daniel Parilla (of Minetta Tavern) has created an over-the-top menu of mouth-watering cuts of beef alongside an offering of light or dark beer (1 glass included in the price), grilled onions, roasted potatoes and country bread with salted butter. For just $35 per person, each guest can feast on endless platters of meat recapturing the festive spirit of a unique time gone by. All marinated in garlic, rosemary &amp; Irish Whiskey, the meat selections will consist of: Standing Bone In Ribeye, Flat Iron Steak, Top sirloin, Bone Marrow, and Beef Cheeks.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Following the gluttonous, messy feast, you can expect to be met with meat sweat-induced fever dreams, it&apos;s all part of the authentic experience. The first dinner takes place on February 27th at 7:30 p.m., by reservation only for groups of 6 or more.</p>
