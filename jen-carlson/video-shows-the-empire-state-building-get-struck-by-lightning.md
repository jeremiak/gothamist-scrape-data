title: Video Shows The Empire State Building Get Struck By Lightning
---

	
										<p>Monday evening&apos;s storm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213326/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/25/weather_so_weathery_now.php">was pretty epic</a>, if epic-ness is measured by lightning bolts per hour and decibel levels. </p>

<p>The Empire State Building, being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213326/http://www.esbnyc.com/fun-facts">a lightning rod</a> for the Midtown area, is struck at least 23 times per year, so it&apos;s not unusual to see nature colliding with the landmark... but it&apos;s not always caught on video. Below, check out lightning strike the building early Monday evening, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213326/https://twitter.com/moltke/status/757690837320945668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Henrik Moltke</a>. Wait for it...</p>
