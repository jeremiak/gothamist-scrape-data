<p>Is the McRib on its own just not satisfying enough? Good news, someone decided to add real food, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171428/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/30/the_mcrib_is_made_of_soles_of_shoes.php">not made of plastic</a>, to the sandwich, taking it to the Next McLevel. Shockingly, this creation didn&apos;t come from the kitchen of an American&#x2014;the frankenfood is from Germany! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171428/http://www.fatandtasty.de/hamburger/mcrib-mit-bacon-und-mozzarella-sticks/">Fat &amp; Tasty</a> blog it&apos;s featured on is all in German, but lucky for you, that was our first language, so allow us to translate. </p>

<p>The creator of the sandwich, which starts out as a regular McRib, promises &quot;an insider tip&quot; for people with &quot;good taste,&quot; suggesting the reader add deep fried mozzarella sticks and fried bacon to create the ultimate meal. They describe it as &quot;breathtaking,&quot; which seems pretty accurate given that it will definitely kill you.</p>

<p>We estimate that the calorie count is around 1,111 (figuring in five mozzarella sticks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171428/http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-arbys-mozzarella-sticks-regular-4-i52264">537 calories</a> total, and two pieces of bacon at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171428/http://www.caloriegallery.com/foods/calories-in-fried-cured-bacon.htm">74 calories</a>), added to the 500 calories in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209171428/http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/mcdonalds/mcrib-sandwich/">the McRib</a>. Guten Appetit!</p>
