										<p>This is where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143110/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/08/31/sell_outs.php">Gothamist tells you what tickets to buy</a>...before they sell out and you are left bargaining on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143110/http://newyork.craigslist.org/tix/">Craigslist</a>. </p>

<p>First and foremost there is the Arcade Fire @ Bowery November 11th, it&apos;s sold out now but we bet that they&apos;ll add more tickets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502143110/http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=xxx&amp;query=search&amp;category=misc&amp;search=arcade+fire&amp;searchregion=xxx&amp;beginmonth=10&amp;beginday=19&amp;beginyear=2004&amp;endmonth=10&amp;endday=10&amp;endyear=2005&amp;sortorder=0">so keep checking</a>. </p>

<p>Okay, so why is this a <i>special edition</i> you may be asking. Well, for the past month or two Gothamist has been putting together its first event.
