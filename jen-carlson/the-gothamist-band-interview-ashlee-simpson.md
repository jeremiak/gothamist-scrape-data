Neither of these are very good things to be known for, but man does that &quot;La La&quot; song make us sort of want to dance. And dance we will when we see her at the Supper Club tomorrow night. <br>
She&apos;s gone blonde again...we&apos;re not sure how this will affect her performance, but the bleach certainly hasn&apos;t harmed her brain, as Ashlee managed to tip-toe her way around our questions like a well-trained PR puppet. But whatever, we&apos;ll still dance.
