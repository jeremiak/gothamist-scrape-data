<p>Don&apos;t tell the cast of <em>Glee</em> to &quot;go back to Ohio&quot; if you see them in town this week... Mayor Bloomberg met the cast today and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526233330/http://twitter.com/#!/NYCMayorsOffice/status/62628089984847872">has announced</a>: &quot;NYC is open to everyone: Greeks, Geeks, Gleeks.&quot; And with that, our long-standing ban of Gleeks has been lifted.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the cast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526233330/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/25/nyc_is_on_gleek_alert_where_to_find.php">is in town this week</a> filming the final episodes of season two, which (spoiler alert!) includes a trip to Lincoln Center and possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526233330/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1380442/Glees-Lea-Michele-lights-Times-Square-technicolour-coat.html">a reenactment</a> of the <em>Mary Tyler Moore Show</em>&apos;s opening credits.</p>
