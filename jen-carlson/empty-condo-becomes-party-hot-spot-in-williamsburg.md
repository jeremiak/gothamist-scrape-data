title: Empty Condo Becomes Party Hot Spot In Williamsburg

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="66North10810.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122214im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/66North10810.jpg" width="300" height="276" class="image-left"> </span>With so many empty condos in Williamsburg, it only makes sense that some enterprising folks have decided to commandeer them for their own personal party spaces. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122214/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/08/02/allnight_rager_at_williamsburg_zombie_building_riles_neighbors.php">Earlier this month</a>, an all-night rave went down in the courtyard area of 66 North 1st Street, and now it seems the rave is coming from <em>inside the building</em>. Yes, the youngsters have found their way indoors, and over the weekend held a party in what seems like every empty unit in the building. </p>

<p>Some neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122214/http://newyorkshitty.com/williamsburg/?p=44109">emailed Miss Heather</a> about the latest incident, with one saying, &quot;it is 1:47 a.m. and there is another party in the same unrented condo building at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122214/http://www.66n1.com/">66 North 1st Street</a>.  This time people are inside all the unrented apartments, some have red lights on, and there are people on the roof (last time it was just the courtyard). I went over and the people were not at all friendly and one of them said &apos;this is DUMBO,&apos; so they are also geographically challenged.  I told them I had called the police and this made them a little nervous but they have not turned the music down. I have no idea who is throwing the party, but I think it&#x2019;s a security guard on the take. The crowd is younger and more mixed this time, including a lot of Hispanic teenagers, a very different crowd than last time.&quot;</p>

<p>Presumably the police were called the first time this happened, and this time around as well, but they didn&apos;t do much... so maybe <em>they&apos;re in on it</em>!</p>
