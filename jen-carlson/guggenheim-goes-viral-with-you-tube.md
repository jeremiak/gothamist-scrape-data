<blockquote>Join us online this Thursday as the jury&#x2019;s top videos from the YouTube Play. A Biennial of Creative Video shortlist are announced via live stream from the Guggenheim. The top videos were selected from more than 23,000 global submissions. After the Guggenheim curators determined a shortlist of 125 works, a distinguished jury selected the most creative videos for presentation at the Guggenheim and to the world.

<p>Hosted by comedian Michael Showalter, the live stream event will feature performances by Grammy Award-winning rock band OK Go; musician, producer, and video artist Kutiman; and more. Outside, the public is invited to view excerpts from the top videos projected in a spectacular display on the museum&apos;s Frank Lloyd Wright-designed facade from 6-10:30 pm on October 21 and 22.</p></blockquote><p></p>
