<p>Last year, following the success of their made-for-television movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707095706/http://gothamist.com/tags/sharknado"><em>Sharknado</em></a>, SyFy announced a sequel was on the way, this time bringing the impossible weather event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707095706/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/17/sharknado_2_will_take_place_in_nyc.php">to New York City</a>. It&apos;s crazy that this movie has not already been made and followed up by four more sequels by now, but apparently the &quot;stars&quot; were too &quot;busy&quot; to work out their contracts. Today, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707095706/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/tv-zone-1.811968/sharknado-2-set-in-new-york-city-re-ups-ziering-reid-1.6911964">Newsday</a> alerts us that Ian Ziering and Tara Reid have finally signed back on, because <em>whatelsearetheygonnado</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sharknado 2: The Second One</em> will go like this: a &quot;freak weather system turns its deadly fury on New York City, unleashing a Sharknado on the population and its most cherished, iconic sites&#x2014;and only Fin and April can save the Big Apple.&quot; Some guy behind the movie says, &quot;We&apos;re thrilled to be able to bring back the talent that made Sharknado a hit. Can lightning strike twice? I don&#x2019;t know, but it&#x2019;s a scientific fact that you&#x2019;re more likely to be killed by lightning than by a shark. This film will have lightning and sharks, so that&#x2019;s got to count for something.&quot; Nailed it.</p>

<p>See you at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707095706/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/vote_for_fear_and_loathing_or_well.php">the outdoor screening this summer</a>!</p>
