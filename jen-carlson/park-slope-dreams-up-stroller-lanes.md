<p>While the Prospect Park bike lane debate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142522/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/25/markowitz_put_breaks_on_prospect_pa.php">rolls on</a>, here&apos;s a new idea to mull over: stroller lanes! Comedian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142522/http://williammullin.com/2010/04/22/strollerlane/">William Mullin</a>, <em>in a parody</em>, imagines the neighborhood&apos;s residents taking the Breeder Wars to a whole new level by installing special lanes for the Bugaboo set.</p>

<p>His faux report states that &quot;the proposal, authored by a local group called Park Slope Childless Hipsters, calls for creating several lanes dedicated to strollers.&quot; One supporter told him, &#x201C;Since strollers are vehicles, they belong on the street with bikes, cars and trucks.&#x201D; With all those parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142522/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/park_slope_parents_still_bringing_b.php">boozing with their babies</a> at bars, that sounds dangerous!</p>

<p>While some view this as win-win in a neighborhood where double-wides often cause pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks, others are against it. Marty Markowitz, who railed against the bike lane proposal recently, said: &#x201C;If you ask me, Brooklynites should take cars everywhere. Get a car seat for the baby and drive. That&#x2019;s what cars are for.&quot;</p>
