title: Video: Close Encounters Above Central Park?
---

	
										<p>Are aliens checking out Manhattan? One man says he filmed a &quot;red craft&quot; UFO for four nights straight this month, and has some footage to back up his claim. He says he filmed from The Great Hill in Central Park, saying, &quot;When I started filming, it hovers about then suddenly I descends near the Reservoir. Slowly and vanishes. After about 30 min, when I got home, It popped up again for about 40 more minutes and morphed into a Plane... I know its sounds crazy... Its been out for about 4 nights so far... <strong>For some reason it knows I&apos;m filming it.</strong>&quot;</p>
