<p>Filmmaker Colby Moore sent along this short &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013310/https://vimeo.com/59825962">creepy montage</a>&quot; of scenes he shot around Manhattan. Even the normal, everyday things you see around town&#x2014;tourists taking photos, people riding the bus&#x2014;end up having a very eerie quality, like at any moment things are about to get <em>murdery</em>. Watch it below for your daily jolt of uneasiness:</p>
