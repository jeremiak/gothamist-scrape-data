										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="rabidracccoon1210.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211029im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/rabidracccoon1210.jpg" width="275" height="220" class="image-left"> </span>Was Prospect Park built on an animal spirit burial ground or something? The tragedies have been steadily piling up there all year, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211029/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/concern-over-rabid-raccoon-in-brooklyn-park/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">City Room</a> reports that a rabid raccoon was found dead near the lake last Thursday. Maybe (s)he&apos;s been behind all the other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211029/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/20/slaughtered_animals_found_in_prospe.php">animal massacres</a>?<br>
 <br>
While official health department reports claim this is only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211029/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/18/rabid_raccoons_reach_brooklyn.php">the second</a> rabid raccoon found in Brooklyn since 1992 (in comparison, 100 tested positive in Central Park this year alone), others claim they&apos;ve been undercounting. That&apos;s what licensed wildlife rehabilitator Anne-Katrin Titze has claimed, and she has a photo of a dead raccoon in Prospect Park from earlier this year which was never tested for rabies. </p>

<p>The health department says they&apos;ve tested only 7 raccoons in the area this year, which in comparison to the Central Park number seems way out of proportion. Titze says they are just throwing dead animals in garbage trucks, and when they are left &quot;untested... to decompose in a city park where children and dogs might stumble upon them, are a serious health hazard.&quot; One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211029/http://brooklynian.com/forum/park-slope/another-rabid-raccoon-prospect-park">Brooklynian</a> poster backed up Titze&apos;s undercounting claim, saying: &quot;I&apos;ve reported 2 different dead raccoons in the last couple of weeks and had a heck of a time getting anyone to actually do anything (I was under the impression that the city wanted to test them due to the recent outbreak).&quot; Be careful Brooklynites, those suckers know how to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211029/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/raccoons_return_to_park_slope_brown.php">break into brownstones</a>.</p>
