title: Atlantic City: the Hamptons for Hipsters?
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229080933/http://downbythehipster.blogspot.com/2008/03/beatrice-goes-atlantic-city.html">Last month</a>, word on the Boardwalk was that two former Atlantic City hotels (the Howard Johnson and Holiday Inn) would morph into a boutique hotel named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229080933/http://www.thechelsea-ac.com/">the Chelsea</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229080933/http://gothamist.com/tags/Hotel%20Chelsea">no relation</a>). Further bringing a Manhattan feel to the has-been Jersey destination is the oft-celeb-drenched scene of Manhattan&apos;s Beatrice Inn; the club&apos;s operators, Paul Sevigny and Matt Abramcyk amongst them, have been charged with creating &quot;a vibe.&quot; The collaboration had AC&apos;s Visitors Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229080933/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/fashion/02atlantic.html?ref=style&amp;pagewanted=all">declaring</a>, &#x201C;The New York hipsters are coming to Atlantic City.&quot;</p>

<p>So will hipsters flock to Jersey this summer, as the well-heeled hit the Hamptons? More details and some renderings have just been released; the Jersey-chic boutique hotel stay will run you about $225 to $450 a night during the &quot;high period.&quot; And with bars, lounges, a pool deck, restaurant, spa, game room and &quot;living room&quot; you&apos;ll never have to step outside the 331-room hotel and see the seedier side of &quot;America&apos;s Playground&quot;. </p>
