Conservator of paintings George Bisacca had the duty of transporting &quot;The Annunciation&quot;, a painting by the Sienese master <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180238/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_di_Giovanni">Sassetta</a> from the 15th-century, there to clear up some questions.  Mainly the &quot;historical conundrum&quot; about whether &quot;the Met&apos;s painting...was originally part of Sassetta&apos;s famous, but long ago fragmented, altarpiece from the Franciscan church of Borgo San Sepolcro in Arezzo.&quot;   </p>

<p>When the original altarpiece, which stands at 16 feet tall, was removed from the church in the late 16th-century - it was dismantled. Twenty-seven of the sixty pieces survived and are currently dispersed amongst ten museums worldwide.  As for the Met&apos;s painting, one problem is that it seemed to be painted on a different wood, but Bisacca&apos;s theory was that when the panel was sawed apart (the other half in a museum in Cleveland), thinned down and placed on a new panel, which would explain the different wood. To prove this, a trip to the hospital was in order.</p><blockquote>The film showed the lamination line where the poplar was attached to the spruce. &quot;It also showed us the cut of the wood &#x2014; a tangential section cut, which is a specific cut in the tree,&quot; Mr. Bisacca said. &quot;We were able to match that up with the Cleveland piece to show that they were in fact once the same piece of wood.&quot; The CT scan of the painting &quot;pretty much proved that it was the other half of the Cleveland panel.&quot;</blockquote>Guess that&apos;s why he gets paid the big bucks.  And if you&apos;re wondering why the altarpiece wasn&apos;t dismantled a bit more gently, Larry Kanter (curator of the Lehman Collection) explains, &quot;they weren&apos;t valuable as art, because they were old-fashioned, but they were valuable as gold or wood. So they were reused as table tops or doors, or burned to recover the gold.&quot; Though all we&apos;re left wondering is what a co-pay on a 15th-century work of art is.<p></p>
