<p>That&apos;s pretty much a rhetorical question, because the above photographic evidence is undeniable (okay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520021841/http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2009/03/no_match.php">not <em>everyone</em></a> agrees). We can now see that James Franco will not only make a fantastic (looking) Ginsberg, but following the news that he&apos;s practically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520021841/http://www.limelife.com/blog-entry/James-Franco-The-Next-Proust/3167.html">the next Proust</a> all but confirms he can encapsulate the influential poet&apos;s spirit. The biopic he&apos;s starring in, the Gus Van Sant-produced <em>Howl</em>, is currently filming in NYC (where the actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520021841/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2009/03/10/james-franco-doesnt-sleep-in-beds/">attends school</a>) and concerns the 1957 obscenity trial that almost got the famous poem banned. (Spoiler alert: Judge Clayton Horn ultimate ruled that &quot;Howl&quot; was of &quot;redeeming social importance.&quot;)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jesse Eisenberg (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520021841/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/12/jesse_eisenberg.php">friend of Gothamist</a>) will also play Ginsberg in a movie set to hit the big screen in 2012, titled <em>Kill Your Darlings</em>&#x2014;but that one will keep the focus on Lucien Carr and the murder of William Burroughs&apos;s childhood friend David Kammerer. </p>

<p>For a dose of immediate, live-action Ginsberg, check him out with Kerouac in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520021841/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/21/video_of_the_da_42.php">this silent video</a> as the two imbibe at Harmony Bar.</p>
