<p>The newly renovated Main Street lawn in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190439/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynbridgepark">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a> was adorned with a new sculpture this morning. The official unveiling will happen later today*, but artist Deborah Kass&apos;s OY/YO piece is already all set up, ready to be Instagrammed. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s a short FAQ we&apos;ve prepared for you about the sculpture: </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I sit on it?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Maybe? The lawn is currently fenced off, though.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I lean against it?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> See above.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I touch it?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Jesus, SEE ABOVE.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I have seen the above, but I&apos;m curious... will the lawn <em>ever</em> be open?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> We asked the fine people at Brooklyn Bridge Park for you, and we were told, &quot;The Main Street lawn is closed to allow the roots to establish&#x2014;will most likely be open next week. Depending on the weather, of course.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I take my engagement photos in front of it?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Be more original.</p>

According to the press release, &quot;OY/YO is sourced from urban and Brooklyn slang, the statement &apos;I am&apos; in Spanish, and the popular Yiddish expression, and as a riff on Ed Ruscha&#x2019;s iconic word painting OOF&quot; (which can be found at MoMA). It joins the ranks of other New Yorkisms found along the city&apos;s bridges, like the &#x201C;Leaving Brooklyn: Oy Vey!&#x201D; sign at the Williamsburg Bridge and the &#x201C;Leaving Brooklyn: Fuhgeddaboudit&#x201D; sign on the BQE. It&apos;s also a reoccurring motif in Kass&#x2019; work, and has appeared in her paintings, prints, and smaller sculptures over the past four years. 

</p><p>This bright yellow aluminum piece is quite large, measuring 8 x 17 x 5 ft, and will be visible from the Manhattan side of the East River as well. It will remain in the Park through August 2016, and coincides with Kass&apos;s exhibition at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190439/http://www.paulkasmingallery.com/artists/deborah-kass">Paul Kasmin Gallery</a>, running December through January.</p>

<p><em>*Update: the unveiling event has been canceled due to weather.</em></p>
