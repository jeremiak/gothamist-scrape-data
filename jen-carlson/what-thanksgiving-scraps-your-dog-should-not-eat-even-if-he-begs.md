<p>Whether you are having a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204424/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/gothamists_guide_to_the_best_boxed.php">trashy Thanksgiving</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204424/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/21/vegetarian_thanksgiving.php">vegetarian Thanksgiving</a>, or a traditional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204424/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/brent.php">turkey Thanksgiving</a>... your dog will definitely be right by your side, begging for some scraps. But stay strong, humans! The best thing you can do is hoard all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204424/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/22/what_to_do_with_all_of_your_thanksg.php">those leftovers</a> for yourself, because Petplan, a company that insures nearly 100,000 dogs and cats across the country, says that its &quot;claims for unexpected food-related illnesses soar over the four-day Thanksgiving weekend.&quot; From pancreatitis to gastroenteritis, dogs and cats are getting sick from your scraps, so try to resist those puppy dog eyes&#x2014;here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Take out the trash immediately to avoid your dog getting into it later.<br>
</li><li>No table scraps or leftovers, especially bones. Soft bones, like those in poultry, can splinter and cause obstructions in your pet&apos;s digestive system.<br>
</li><li>Remember that raw or undercooked turkey can harbor salmonella, which can cause the same disastrous gastrointestinal affects in our pets as it does in us.<br>
</li><li>Onions and garlic have a supporting role in stuffing and other side dishes, but can be dangerous when ingested by our pets, especially cats.</li></ul>Get all of their tips <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204424/http://www.gopetplan.com/blogpost/thanksgiving-fur-all-tips-to-avoid-a-turkey-day-disaster-from-petplan-pet-insurance">right here</a>, and note, if you must let your pet indulge, give them some pet-safe veggies like broccoli or carrots, or a small taste of plain turkey, instead. Or better yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204424/http://www.gopetplan.com/blogpost/petfriendly-thanksgiving-recipes-from-petplan-pet-insurance">here are some pet-friendly recipes</a> you can make on Thursday specifically for your furry friends.<p></p>
