<p>It has been months since we first reported on the first annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421223500/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/brooklyn_bar_on_the_hunt_for_the_sm.php">Smallest Penis in Brooklyn contest</a>&#x2014;since then the weather has changed, the days have gotten longer, and we&apos;ve received more than enough emails from confused readers thinking they should send us photos of their tiny penises. Please stop doing that. Tomorrow is your day to shine.</p>

<p>Organizers at Kings County Bar confirmed with us yesterday that this is <em>really happening</em>: &quot;The contest is absolutely happening this Saturday.  Time has been moved up slightly, so we are anticipating starting between 3-4pm (doors will open to the public at 2pm). There are currently 12 contestants.&quot; Also, they expect a crowd, so get there early if you want to get a good view. Please be advised, the tiny penises may be covered by underwear, as nudity is not required. That underwear, however, will be made wet with water guns.</p>

<p>There was no max size requirement for the contest, and our sources tell us probably half will be swiftly eliminated&#x2014;so prepare to heckle the show-offs. When we spoke to one organizer, Aimee Arciuolo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421223500/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/19/smallest_penis_in_brooklyn_contest.php">in May</a>, she told us: &quot;I do expect there will be a few giant dicks that come to show off, but if they are over eight inches they will be disqualified and forced to buy a round for the judges.&quot;</p>

<p>This will all go down at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421223500/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kings-County-Bar/159494600774673">Kings County Bar</a> tomorrow, Saturday July 20th, around 3 p.m. We&apos;re dispatching a reporter and photographer for total coverage, so stay tuned for that on Sunday.</p>
