										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="cwalk0711.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012506im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cwalk0711.jpg" width="250" height="318"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Young Christopher Walken, really!</span></i></div> What would happen if Greek gods were living in a brownstone in modern day NYC? Hollywood will tell us in a new movie called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012506/http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/07/divine-casting-christopher-walken-to-play-zeus-in-new-movie/"><em>Gods Behaving Badly</em></a>, starring Christopher Walken as Zeus. The film adaptation of the best-selling British novel will bring all of the ancient Greek deities together under one brownstone roof, all stripped of their powers and joining the workforce.<p></p>

<p>Production will begin this month, and alongside Walken will be an all-star cast, which looks like this: Aphrodite (Sharon Stone), Apollo (Oliver Platt), Artemis (Edie Falco), Demeter (Phylicia Rashad), Dionysus (Nelsan Ellis), Eros (Gideon Glick), Hades (John Turturro), Hermes (Henry Zebrowski), and Persephone (Rosie Perez). Alicia Silverstone is also in the cast, but playing a modern day New Yorker.</p>

<p>Without that kind of cast, this production may have turned into a Greek tragedy! Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012506/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/20/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_meg_ryan_hits_rea.php#photo-10"><em>Kate &amp; Leopold</em></a>.</p>
