Michael Stipe, Bright Eyes, Public Enemy frontman Chuck D, Rufus Wainwright, Steve Earle, Fischerspooner, Peaches and Devendra Banhart will join forces for the event which will benefit the Iraq War Veterans Against the War and Veterans for Peace. </p>

<p>An event like this will of course include everyone&apos;s favorite verbose celebrities: Jane Fonda, Alec Baldwin, Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo - who will be joining peace activist Cindy Sheehan. Sheehan&apos;s son, Casey, was killed in Iraq in 2004. Last August she held a month-long demonstration outside President Bush&apos;s Texas ranch. </p>

<p>This concert will kick off the national Bring &apos;Em Home speaking tour, in which Sheehan and noted authors will hit 15 cities in the US in April. </p>

<p>Tickets for the event, which will take place at Hammerstein Ballroom, are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017064710/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/00003C55AA685F00">available here</a> - the prices range from $28 to $150 (plus those lovely Ticketmaster fees). <br>
