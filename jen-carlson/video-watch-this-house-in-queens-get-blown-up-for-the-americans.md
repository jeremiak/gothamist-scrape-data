<p>Last week FX&apos;s <em>The Americans</em> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523113403/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/explosion_to_rock_brooklyn_tomorrow.php">filming explosion scenes</a> in both Brooklyn (Union Street between Hicks and Columbia Streets) and Queens (Park Lane South between 112th and 115th Streets). Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523113403/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/amazing_video_of_boardwalk_empire_f.php">we love a good fireball</a>, we&apos;ve been keeping an eye on YouTube for spectator footage to turn up, and <em>finally</em> some has. Below is the explosion that took place in Queens, which occurs just after the 1:50 mark:</p>

<p><em>The Americans</em> takes place in the 1980s Cold War-era suburbs of Washington D.C., but has been filming around New York City. The show stars Keri Russell (n&#xE9;e Felicity) and Matthew Rhys, who play KGB spies posing as a married couple.</p>
