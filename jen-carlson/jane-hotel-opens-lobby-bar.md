</div></div><p>We&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322070056/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/26/the_jane_hotel.php">glimpses of the Jane Hotel</a> before, but now the West Village establishment has opened their lobby bar. Owners Sean MacPhearson (Bowery/Maritime Hotels) and Eric Goode say the style is understated; &quot;Since our rooms are compact, the bar will feel like a living room for our guests, a place where they can just hang out. If you ever see a velvet rope, it&#x2019;ll probably be hanging from the ceiling.&#x201D; Consisting of three rooms&#x2014;a front bar, a ballroom lounge and an upstairs mezzanine&#x2014;the space will be open to hotel guests as well as friends and visitors. And thirsty artists take note: <strong>&quot;The Jane lobby bar will also revive the revered New York tradition of bartering drinks for art from its patrons.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Coming up for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322070056/http://www.thejanenyc.com/">the Jane</a>:  A full-service riverfront <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130322070056/http://www.the-feedbag.com/mr-snitch/cafe-gitane-coming-to-jane-hotel">caf&#xE9; slated to open this fall</a>, and carved from the lobby-level space that once housed Socialista nightclub.</p>
