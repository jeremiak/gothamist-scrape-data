<p>Just like the &quot;plotline&quot; of E.L. James&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215902/http://gothamist.com/tags/fiftyshadesofgrey"><em>Fifty Shades Of Grey</em></a> series, this was predictable: the erotica trilogy is now being branded out, and a line of products bearing its name will soon be coming to the shelves. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215902/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/fifty-shades-grey-merchandise-lingerie-perfume-336459?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, there will be <em>Fifty Shades</em> fragrances and other beauty products, bedding, home furnishings, jewelry, and adult products. They report that &quot;James and her agent Val Hoskins selected UK-based Caroline Mickler Ltd. to be the global licensing agent for merchandise based on the best-selling trilogy.&quot; Mickler is also considering a lingerie line, and stationary... for those who want to catch up on their correspondances after a nice whipping?</p>

<p>Mickler says, &quot;The market&apos;s interest in <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> as a brand is enormous... We expect this property to make a very strong showing.&quot; As you can see, the &quot;knock offs&quot; on Etsy are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215902/http://www.etsy.com/search?q=fifty%20shades&amp;view_type=gallery&amp;ship_to=ZZ&amp;min=0&amp;max=0">very popular</a>.</p>
