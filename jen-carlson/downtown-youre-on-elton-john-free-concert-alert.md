										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="eltonunion0411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235944im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/eltonunion0411.jpg" width="365" height="261"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Elton John and Leon Russell in The Union</span></i></div> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235944/http://gothamist.com/tags/tribecafilmfestival2011">TriBeCa Film Festival</a> starts today, with a kick-off concert from recent SNL host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235944/http://gothamist.com/tags/eltonjohn">Sir Elton John</a>, paired up with an outdoor screening of the world premiere of Cameron Crowe&apos;s documentary <em>The Union</em>... all for free! So you know it&apos;s going to be a clusterf*ck. Want to be a part of the madness? Read on...<p></p>

<p>Today at 4 p.m. wristbands will be distributed at the BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center, at the West Side Highway entrance, just north of Chambers, with a limit of two wristbands per person. This gets you into the Elton show, as well as Crowe&apos;s film (which, by the way, chronicles the making of the 2010 album of the same name, a collaboration between pop icon Elton John and his keyboardist Leon Russell). As for capacity... we&apos;re told this is up to the NYPD that will be on hand.</p>

<p>Previously it was noted that programming could begin at the North Cove of the World Financial Plaza as early as 7:30 p.m. (with the screening first, followed by the performance). We&apos;ve contacted the organizers to see if anything has changed since this initial announcement, because, you know... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235944/http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/10281">the weather</a>. They tell us: </p>

<blockquote>The free, outdoor screening of the world premiere of Cameron Crowe&#x2019;s documentary The Union will open the 10th edition of the Tribeca Film Festival tonight RAIN OR SHINE. 

<p>However, in the event of inclement weather, Elton John will not perform from the outdoor stage.  Instead, the performance will be streamed live on the outdoor screen at the North Cove at the World Financial Plaza and via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235944/http://www.tribecafilm.com/">www.tribecafilm.com</a> immediately following the film.</p>

<p>Fans are advised to watch the weather this afternoon and plan accordingly.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>That&apos;s correct, if you haven&apos;t been Knighted you stay outside with the commoners! So perhaps, given the 60% chance of rain and thunderstorms this evening, forget what we said earlier about the whole clusterf*ck thing.</p>
