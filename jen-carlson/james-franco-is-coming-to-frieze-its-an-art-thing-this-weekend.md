<p>Ever since that scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011412/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">in <em>Girls</em></a>&#x2014;you know the one, refresh below&#x2014;we&apos;ve just really been into the New York City art world, you know? (Just kidding, most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011412/https://twitter.com/#!/jenist/status/197485449550376962">art parties are terrible</a>.) But if you want to dip your toes into the scene, this is a good week for it&#x2014;with both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011412/http://friezenewyork.com/">Frieze</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011412/http://www.pulse-art.com/newyork/">Pulse</a> rolling into town. We&apos;ll have a curated guide later this week, but to get your heart racing for the white hot happenings, we offer you the below.</p>

<p>Tonight MOMA PS1 is kicking off the Frieze weekend early, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011412/http://momaps1.org/calendar/view/352">a Martha Wainwright performance</a> and a chance to check out the Kraftwerk Retrospective installation. There will also be a special DJ set by Mark Ronson, because art can rarely exist without celebrity (though the reverse is definitely not true). And that brings us to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011412/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a>...</p>

<p>Franco is launching his book, <em>Dangerous Book Four Boys</em>, as part of Frieze this Sunday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011412/http://momaps1.org/calendar/view/350/">at 5:30 p.m.</a> (get there early), also at PS1. &quot;The author&quot; will be talking to the museum&apos;s director Klaus Biesenbach, and will also be on hand to sign his book, which is currently sitting on our desk, and includes things like Franco wearing a penis mask on his nose. Slow clap... Let&apos;s hear it for art, everyone.</p>

<p>Pro tip: wear your most comfortable shoes and you&apos;ll look &quot;eccentric&quot; but more importantly you&apos;ll be able to chase down the guy with the wine tray faster.</p>
