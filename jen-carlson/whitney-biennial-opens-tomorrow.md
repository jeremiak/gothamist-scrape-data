</div></div>					<p>The 75th Whitney Biennial is upon us, opening tomorrow and running through May 30th. This year&apos;s 55 artists were selected by curator Francesco Bonami and associate curator Gary Carrion-Murayari, who released a statement saying: &#x201C;The artists selected for this year&#x2019;s exhibition reflect diverse responses to the anxiety and optimism of the past two years. 2010 does not privilege any one medium or aesthetic style, but rather assembles a wide range of individual gestures, personal histories, and improvised encounters that speak to a sense of openness and community.&#x201D; In the past the exhibition has been called out for being &quot;too cliquey.&quot; Take a peek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150245/http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2010Biennial">at what&apos;s in store</a> before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150245/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/06/whitney_biennia.php">becoming enraged</a> at their latest survey of American art.</p>
