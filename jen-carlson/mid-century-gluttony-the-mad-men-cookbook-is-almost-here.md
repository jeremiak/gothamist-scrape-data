<p>Just in time for the holidays, the Unofficial <em>Mad Men</em> Cookbook is set to hit shelves on November 29th, making all of your mid-century culinary dreams come true. While food from that era can typically be more of a nightmare (just check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150036/http://www.flickr.com/photos/superjunk/192043318/in/pool-649528@N21/">these screamin&apos; neon weenies</a>), <em>this</em> book will take you back in style. It promises to bring you inside the kitchens, bars, and restaurants of Don Draper&apos;s world, saying:</p><blockquote>Ever wish you could mix an Old Fashioned just the way Don Draper likes it? Or prepare Oysters Rockefeller and a martini the way they did fifty years ago at one of Roger Sterling&apos;s favorite haunts, The Grand Central Oyster Bar? Ever wonder how Joan Harris manages to prepare a perfect crown roast in her tiny apartment kitchen?</blockquote>You&apos;ll also get some casserole dishes, and Peggy Olson&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s coffee cake recipe, along with a specific scene which each concoction appeared in. Hone your skills in the kitchen and learn to work that shaker, and be prepared for your <em>Mad Men</em> party when the show finally returns <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150036/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/mad_men_wont_return_this_year.php">next year</a>&#x2014;you can start with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150036/http://www.unofficialmadmencookbook.com/excerpt.htm">this Keens&apos; Steakhouse Caesar salad recipe</a>, which appeared in season three. <em>Or</em> you can click through the Mid-Century Supper Club photo pool on Flickr, which is endlessly entertaining (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150036/http://www.flickr.com/photos/coopgirlkiz/3757311102/in/pool-649528@N21/">Frosted Melon</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150036/http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparkleneely/2934321539/in/pool-649528@N21/">Fried Spam</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150036/http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparkleneely/2935176916/in/pool-649528@N21/">Hot Pink Deviled Eggs</a>!).<p></p>
