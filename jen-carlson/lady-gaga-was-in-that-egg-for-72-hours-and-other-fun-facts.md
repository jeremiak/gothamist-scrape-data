<p>Watch your back David Blaine (and Snooki)! In an interview on Sirius this morning, Lady Gaga claimed she was in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153814/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/13/of_course_lady_gaga_hits_grammys_re.php">her Grammy egg</a> for 72 hours straight. <em>See how she suffers for you little monsters.</em> When asked, &quot;Did someone send you food in there? Or the bathroom?&quot; She replied, &quot;I am not going to explain the details. I am a lady.&quot;</p>

<p>Gaga also said she&apos;s destined for the big screen (perhaps a remake of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153814/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/14/lady_gaga_vs_late_80s_madonna.php">Who&apos;s That Girl?</a></em>), and that she would want &quot;Marisa Tomei to play me. I am such a Marisa Tomei fan. All my friends call me Marisa when I get angry. Because my New York accent just flies out of my body and I start smacking my gum.&quot;<br>
 <br>
New York bands who are fans of the Fame Monster, practice up, she also vowed to bring local bands on each tour with her (up next are Lady Starlight and Scissor Sisters). She told the station, &quot;I suppose next year on the new tour, I&#x2019;ll bring some more New York bands. I like to keep it New York&quot; (as long as it&apos;s not Yonkers). As for the rest of the city, watch out... Gaga says she&apos;s currently on &quot;the drunk diet.&quot; And you know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419153814/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/11/lady_gaga_loses_it_at_mets_game.php">what that means</a>.</p>
