</div></div>					<p>Last year the &quot;8&quot; in the New Year&apos;s 2008 sign headed to Times Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150111/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/14/17_days_from_8s.php">via subway</a> (the 6 train to be exact). This year, it took to the seas and traveled by boat. 9&apos;s publicist tells us:</p><blockquote>It was a NY Waterway boat that picked up passengers in Weehawken and then came across the Hudson to the Waterway&#x2019;s Midtown Terminal at W. 39th and the West Side Highway.<p></p>

<p>The number is now sitting in Times Square with the &#x2018;2-0-0&#x2019; at the Duracell Power Lodge (1540 Bway between 45/46 - right above the Charmin bathrooms) where people are pedaling on stationary bikes to generate electricity that is being stored and will be used to light the numbers on New Year&#x2019;s Eve.</p></blockquote>Help keep 2009 green and get thee on a bike! Also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150111/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/">in the area</a> is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150111/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/11/ball.php">the new ball</a>, and the &quot;confetti wishing wall&quot; is back, where you can write your New Year&apos;s wish on a piece of confetti and see it fall into the crossroads of broken dreams when the clock strikes midnight.<p></p>
