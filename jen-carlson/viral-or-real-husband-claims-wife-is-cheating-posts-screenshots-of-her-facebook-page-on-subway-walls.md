<p>A tipster sent us this photo today, taken this morning at the Wall Street subway station. The display you see consists of screenshots from a woman&apos;s Facebook and iPhone, and was presumably put there by a scorned husband, Philip, to publicly call out his cheating wife, Erin. We&apos;ve sent someone over to get clearer photos of the collage, and for a closer look to determine if this is some sort of viral marketing campaign for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922100951/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/09/terrible_website_promoting_affairs.php">a stupid dating website</a> or phone plan or Lifetime movie <em>or whatever</em>. Stay tuned! And if you <em>are</em> real, hang in there, Philip.</p>
