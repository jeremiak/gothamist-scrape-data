Yesterday locals and tourists alike gathered in Times Square for what was dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172154/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/nye/nye_goodriddance.html">Good Riddance Day</a>. They hauled in medical bills, photographs and floppy disks (remember those?), all to be destroyed, shredded and wiped from their memory. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172154/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/nyregion/29shred.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports that &quot;the alliance, a business group that works to promote and improve the neighborhood, rented a five-foot-tall, beige industrial shredder and installed it in the lobby of the Times Square Information Center on Seventh Avenue near West 47th Street.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172154/http://www.wnbc.com/christmastree/14939599/detail.html?qs=;s=9;w=400">One man</a> from Brooklyn brought a red suitcase stuffed with so many papers that he jammed the shredder and was asked to leave so others could have a chance. One of which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172154/http://www.wnbc.com/christmastree/14939599/detail.html?qs=;s=2;w=400">a woman</a> who brought her Blackberry, Palm Pilot and cell phone hoping it would bring her &quot;peace and quiet&quot; -- but we&apos;re betting she just got an iPhone for Christmas. Spontaneous participants scrawled their fears and doubts onto pieces of scrap paper and tossed them in. </p>

<p>When the alliance posted about their event, they invited everyone to &#x201C;join us in mashing a year&#x2019;s worth of bad hairstyles, loathed music, fashion disasters and ill-fated romances into an unrecognizable pulp of bad karma and negative vibes &#x2014; which will then be carted off, never to be seen again. Because sometimes, you just need to let go.&#x201D; And those who couldn&apos;t get away to erase the memories themselves, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172154/http://www.wnbc.com/christmastree/14939599/detail.html?qs=;s=15;w=400">emailed them in</a>!</p>
