<p>The 13-story rental building was under construction (but has been declared structurally stable), and no injuries were reported; the DoB told the the site that &quot;the accident occurred while workers at the site were dismantling a mobile crane. One of the crane&apos;s counterweights &#x2014; used to balance the load the crane is lifting &#x2014; struck a sidewalk shed, causing part of the structure to collapse.&quot;  Thankfully, no one was hurt.</p>

<p>Currently there&apos;s a stop work order for the crane, and the operator was issued a an Environmental Control Board violation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150602/http://westsidespirit.com/?p=3347#more-3347">West Side Spirit</a> talked to a nearby resident, David Fuhrman of 382 Central Park West, who told them &quot;he had filed two complaints about the crane with the department, starting on Oct. 5, before this afternoon&#x2019;s accident. &apos;<strong>The crane operator should not be operating this crane</strong>,&apos; he said. &apos;It pisses me off. It could have been my building.&apos;&#x201D;</p>
