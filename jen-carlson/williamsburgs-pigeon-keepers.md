</div></div><p>The pigeon keepers of New York have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102712/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/29/pigeons_1.php">in the spotlight</a> recently, and now a new JL Aronson documentary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102712/http://www.creativearson.com/upontheroof"><em>Up on the Roof</em></a>, looks at the gentrification of Williamsburg through their experiences.</p><blockquote><em>Up on the Roof</em> follows several devoted pigeon breeders in one predominantly Latino section of Brooklyn through the rigors and rewards of a quintessential New York tradition. All along the waterfront, and throughout blue collar Brooklyn, pigeon fancying has been an active pastime for centuries, handed down from one group of residents to the next, and Williamsburg has long been the center of the action. But as with so many once blighted and now hip districts throughout the world, Brooklyn and Williamsburg in particular is being scrubbed of its old world character to make way for a new urbanism. This colorful, urban-wildlife doc considers what we lose in the process of urban renewal and treats the audience like an insider in an unseen and in many ways vanishing world.</blockquote>The urban wildlife film will be screened on September 22nd at the NY International Independent Film Festival, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102712/http://www.creativearson.com/upontheroof/video.html">here&apos;s a sneak peek</a>.<p></p>
