One of this year&apos;s new CSAs on the block, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701185029/http://southsidecsa.wordpress.com/">Southside CSA</a> in Brooklyn, has teamed up with Bridget and Bridge Vineyards to pair vegetable and fruit shares from Orange County with New York regional wine shares.  We had a chance to catch up with one of the core members of the Southside CSA, Ryan Kuonen, to learn more about the group and its promise to bring fresh food from local fields to Brooklyn kitchens.</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Interested? You can sign up Mondays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701185029/http://bridgeurbanwinery.com/">at Bridget</a>, 20 Broadway in Williamsburg, from 6:30 to 8:30pm through April 7th. And don&apos;t forget your checkbook and calendar!</em></p>

<p><strong>How did the Southside CSA get started?</strong> The Williamsburg CSA was created back in 1999 as the first low-income CSA in New York City. It was organized by El Puente with the exact purpose of giving the people in South Williamsburg access to fresh, healthy produce. After two years of direct involvement, El Puente stepped back and volunteers from the neighborhood took over the organizational duties. Eventually, as the Williamsburg CSA became more centered around the farmer&apos;s market at McCarren Park, the direct connection with the Southside began to fade. </p>

<p>Yolim Khoo and I had joined the Williamsburg CSA back in 2004. After a couple years of involvement, we became inspired to join the core group, and through our volunteer work as the accountant and communication coordinators,  we realized the potential of Williamsburg to support lots and lots of farms through multiple CSAs. Both of us live on the Southside, which has a clear lack of fresh produce available, and we wanted to bring a CSA back into this part of the neighborhood. Meanwhile we got hooked up with Mikella Millen and Esther Giangrande through the Greenpoint-Williamsburg CSA&apos;s low income fundraising group. That group organized fundraisers at Bridge Urban Wine Bar to benefit the Greenpoint Soup Kitchen. It was during these benefit brunches that we got a chance to discuss sustainable agriculture and our neighborhood, and the Southside CSA was born.</p>
