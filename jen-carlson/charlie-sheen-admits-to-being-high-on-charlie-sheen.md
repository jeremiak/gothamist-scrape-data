<p>Catch that? He said, &quot;Yeah, I am on a drug. It&#x2019;s called Charlie Sheen.&#x201D; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110306222641/http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/charlie-sheen-drugs-5314511">Esquire</a>, an 8 ball of Charlie Sheen would cost just under $4,300! Also, Sheen warns us common folk&apos;s faces will melt off if we try it!  During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110306222641/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/02/28/2011-02-28_charlie_sheen_ill_sue_cbs_for_two_and_a_half_men_mess_gma_today_show_air_rival_i.html">his morning talk show circuit</a>, Sheen told Good Morning America, &quot;I decided to embrace [his addictions] violently. The run I was on made Sinatra, Jagger, Richards, all the others look like droopy-eyed, armless children. It was epic,&quot; while telling the Today Show he expects CBS to &quot;apologize while licking my feet.&quot;</p>

During a 20/20 interview, he said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry if I offended you. Didn&#x2019;t know you were so sensitive.&quot; That interview (which you can watch some of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110306222641/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/charlie-sheen-interview-special-edition-2020/story?id=13008140">here</a>, was filmed on location at his at-home &quot;rehab,&quot; and will air tomorrow. </p>
