<p>Some people like to complain about the city&apos;s Showtime dancers, something I&apos;ve never understood&#x2014;if you can&apos;t appreciate some kids dancing on your commute home after a long day, do you even enjoy life? </p>

<p>Oh, you&apos;re afraid they&apos;ll make contact with your body? When is the last time you even heard about a Showtime dancer injuring a straphanger, seriously. And if they do, it&apos;s a badge of honor&#x2014;as someone probably said once, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133454/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/what_is_a_real_new_yorker.php">you ain&apos;t a real New Yorker until</a> you&apos;ve been kicked in the face by a subway performer. </p>

<p>Maybe this video&#x2014;which aims to document &quot;a changing city that is losing culture and character&quot;&#x2014;will change your mind about hearing those two beautiful words: &quot;IT&apos;S SHOOOOOOWWWWTIME!&quot;</p>

<p>The short, called &quot;Erosion,&quot; features dancers Dayrome &#x201C;Bad Day&#x201D; Wright, Kester &#x201C;Flexx&#x201D; Estephane, Anthony &#x201C;Laiden&#x201D; John and Makaveli Qu, and is a collaboration between Brandon Bloch, Tim Sessler and Brandon Bray. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133454/http://www.brooklynaerials.com/blog/">They explain</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;The goal was to make a visually stylized piece that captures how we see New York City changing around us.  Every New Yorker is familiar with Showtime dancers cheering up a full subway car&#x2014;though these days dancers get arrested instead of earning tips for their talents.  Dancers are being forced out of the subway and now have alternative events like &apos;Its Showtime NYC&apos; to legally dance above ground. Moving towards a landscape of sterile glass high rises. It is a safe, clean, boring new world!&quot;</blockquote><p></p>
