<p>One trash talker explains: &quot;It&apos;s because we&apos;re fastidious; on recycling pickup days, you&apos;ll see our perfectly cleaned-out bottles and peanut butter jars on the street.&quot; Perhaps in part because of their attention to detail, they are #1 in recycling, whereas the slackers in Park Slope came in 2nd, recycling a full 4% less. One shocked resident of the Brownstone neighborhood says, &quot;I&apos;m surprised we didn&apos;t come out on top; we pride ourselves on environmental awareness.&quot; Step it up, Slope.</p>
