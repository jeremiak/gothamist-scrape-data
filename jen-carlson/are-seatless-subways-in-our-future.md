<p>Just think of how many more people could cram into each subway car if there were no seats! That&apos;s the idea behind the latest MTA plan which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000247/http://www.wnbc.com/news/17072418/detail.html?rss=ny&amp;psp=news">WNBC</a> reports will bring flip-up seats underground. The seats will be unforgiving during rush hour, as they&apos;ll be locked in the up position. Hmm, this isn&apos;t going to help the different lines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000247/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/29/l_train_ruled_best_by_straphangers.php">raise their grades</a>!</p>

<p>The pilot program will feature the seats in 4 of 10 cars, and &quot;officials hope to squeeze more people -- as many as 18 percent more -- inside such cars.&quot; No word yet on which line will test out the program, or when it will reach all trains, but the roll out program will start later this year (as early as 5 months from now).  To the elderly, pregnant and others who require seats...you&apos;ve been warned.</p>

After all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000247/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axwMxUBL_ws">we all know what the Tokyo subway system looks like during rush hour</a> -- and they instituted a similar plan in 1990.</p>
