										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="closeenountersaliens.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325191028im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/closeenountersaliens.jpg" width="275" height="234" class="image-left"> </span>We just received a message from the NASA Solar System Ambassador for New York City, in preparation of NASA&apos;s big announcement tomorrow regarding an &quot;astrobiology finding.&quot; And as anyone with Google knows, that pretty much means THE ALIENS ARE HERE. (Perhaps that is why the sky looked so creepy and foreboding this afternoon.) Really though, they <em>are</em> here... in fact, you are probably friends with aliens on Facebook!</p>

<p>There are already speculations regarding what tomorrow evening&apos;s press conference might be about <em>exactly</em>, but let&apos;s stick to the known elements for now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325191028/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/8174040/Life-as-we-dont-know-it-discovery-could-prove-existence-of-aliens.html">The Telegraph</a> reports that researchers will unveil the discovery of a microbe that can live in an environment previously thought too poisonous for any life-form to survive.&quot; They say NASA may touch upon the &quot;discovery of &apos;shadow&apos; creatures which exist in tandem with our own&quot; that could &quot;develop into intelligent creatures such as humans.&quot;</p>

<p>The microbe in question was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in California&apos;s Yosemite National Park, where the creature has somehow used arsenic to survive&#x2014;as one astrobiologist said, &quot;They&apos;re aliens, but aliens that share the same home as us.&quot;</p>

<p>Watch the announcement&#x2014;which will also feature some news about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325191028/http://www.myfoxphilly.com/dpp/news/local_news/nasa-to-make-alien-biology-statement">Saturn moon Titan</a>&#x2014;tomorrow at 6 p.m., it will be streaming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325191028/http://www.nasa.gov/ntv">here</a>. Trust no one, may the force be with you, etc.</p>
