<p>Much chatter followed Two Trees (David and Jed Walentas&apos;s) proposal for an 18-story residential building near the Brooklyn Bridge in DUMBO. The building would include a public middle school and &quot;dozens of units of below-market-rate housing,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116090224/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/51/31_51_sp_dock_rejected.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that neighborhood folk don&apos;t want to &quot;block some views of the historic span.&quot; </p>

<p>Two Community Board subcommittees finally met to vote on what&apos;s being called the Dock Street development, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116090224/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2008/12/cb2_says_dock_s.php">Brownstoner</a> has the recap of the delayed decision making process, saying that last Thursday &quot;the youth, education and cultural affairs committee made a unanimous recommendation to support the inclusion of a public middle school in the mixed-use development; on Saturday, however, the land use committee voted 7-6 against the current design.&quot; The latter declared it was &quot;too tall,&quot; and in the end, the committee voted 10-1 in support of rezoning the site and allowing a 75-foot-tall building, but Two Trees says that limitation just won&apos;t cut it. A final vote will be made in January, before it hits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116090224/http://www.brooklyn-usa.org/">Marty&apos;s desk</a>.</p>
