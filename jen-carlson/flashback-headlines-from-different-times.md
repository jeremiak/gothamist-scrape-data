</div></div>					<p>Here&apos;s a fun look back at some of the old New York Tribune cover stories (you can view them all at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504221518/http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=8623220%40N02&amp;q=new+york+tribune&amp;m=text">Library of Congress</a>). Like that time New Yorkers became obsessed with ballooning, or when we were convinced we&apos;d all be living in aerial houseboats by now, and who can forget that time the editor was like, &quot;what if giant creatures were coming through our streets and eating us?&quot; Nothing like a little hypothetical scaremongering on a slow news day!</p>
