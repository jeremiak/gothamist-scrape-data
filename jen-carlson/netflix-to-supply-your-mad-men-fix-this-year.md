So at least we&apos;ll get to experience Don Draper&apos;s infidelities in syndication! </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150126/http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/netflix-pacts-with-lionsgate-to-stream-mad-men/">Deadline</a>, &quot;Netflix has signed an exclusive syndication deal with Mad Men producer Lionsgate to stream up to seven seasons of the Emmy-winning AMC drama. Under the pact, the first four seasons of Mad Men will be available on Netflix&apos;s Watch Instantly service beginning on July 27th.&quot; The rest of the seasons will be added after they air on AMC.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150126/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/apr/06/netflix-mad-men">The Guardian</a> notes that the deal will have Netflix paying nearly $1 million per episode, which in the end will add up to around $90 million. But it may already be paying off, they also note that shares in Netflix already rose 2% on after news of the <em>Mad Men</em> deal. Don Draper saves the day once again.</p>
