<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070832/https://twitter.com/#!/TheGoodfella_/status/155006623994232832">someone Tweeted</a> this photo of a giant monster rat, supposedly discovered at a Foot Locker in the Bronx. You might recognize this guy, as he bears a striking resemblance to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429070832/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/brooklyn_man_stabs_giant_rat_with_p.php">the 3-foot-long beast</a> that was stabbed with a pitchfork in Brooklyn last year. That one was believed to be a Gambian pouched rat, and may have been someone&apos;s escaped pet. However, it wasn&apos;t the first one spotted in that area, and locals believed they were multiplying faster than Gremlins taking a bath.</p>

Was there anything in that Mayan prophecy about rodents?</p>
