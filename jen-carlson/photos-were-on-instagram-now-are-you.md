</div></div><p>Recently we (finally) joined Instagram, which is now the the most popular photo-sharing service out there, as well as a fast-growing social network. They have over 27 million users, even though the service is only, unfortunately, available through an iPhone app right now. It&apos;s a little inhibiting even with an iPhone&#x2014;for example, to our knowledge, there&apos;s no way of browsing someone&apos;s photo archives online unless you have a direct link to the image. So on that note, we thought we&apos;d share some of our photos with you here. If you are using Instagram, you can follow us there at &quot;Gothamist,&quot; and here&apos;s a little look at the photos we&apos;ve been posting (with lots of help from one of our photographers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120327235942/http://samhorine.com/">Sam Horine</a>).</p>

<p>FYI: for those who cannot connect to Instagram yet, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120327235942/http://www.fastcompany.com/1824797/exclusive-hipstamatic-instagram-partnership-api-import-photos-social-network-kevin-systrom">recent reports</a>, they&apos;re expanding through partnerships and making plenty of changes&#x2014;there will even be an Android app in the future, which this weekend they launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120327235942/http://instagr.am/android/">a sign-up page</a> for.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We were just informed of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120327235942/http://web.stagram.com/">Webstagram</a>! Which allows you to view images off your iPhone. And with that, please hashtag photos you would like us to see and use on the site with #Gothamist.</p>
