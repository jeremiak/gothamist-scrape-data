<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="dylanwk95.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/dylanwk95.jpg" width="250" height="254" class="image-right"> </span><em>We&apos;re celebrating Bob Dylan&apos;s 71st birthday with a series of posts about the legendary songwriter this week. As mercurial as Dylan has always been, there is one thing we do know: for as long as Dylan has been writing songs, he has been writing to, for and about New York City. Yesterday we delved into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/dylan_week_begins_our_13_favorite_b.php#photo-1">our favorite Dylan covers</a>, and today we&apos;re revisiting his Freewheelin&apos; album cover.</em></p>

<p>A few years ago we had an ongoing series called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycalbumart">NYC Album Art</a>, where we tried to uncover more about some well-known album covers shot in New York City, this of course included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/18/nyc_album_art_t.php">The Freewheelin&apos; Bob Dylan</a>. The cover features a photograph of a 21-year-old Dylan and his girlfriend at the time, Suze Rotolo (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/bob_dylan_muse_suze_rotolo_dies_at.php">died last February</a>). History will tell you Rotolo inspired the songs &quot;Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s Alright&quot; and &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather.&quot; It will also tell you that Dylan wanted to (add a woman and) recreate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://www.artnet.de/artwork_images/424236030/171528.jpg">this shot of James Dean</a>. </p>

<p>The photograph was taken in February 1963 by Don Hunstein on Jones Street and West 4th Street (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=jones+street+and+west+4th+street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.731828,-74.001052&amp;spn=0.006041,0.016104&amp;sll=40.732318,-74.001697&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,255.97,,0,3.13&amp;cbll=40.732318,-74.001697&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=W+4th+St+%26+Jones+St,+New+York,+10014&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=eKbOEPjlWGnRjn95cww-cA">here&apos;s what it looks like today</a>), nearby Dylan and Rotolo&apos;s $60/month (that&apos;s a little over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://www.westegg.com/inflation/">$400 today</a>) at 161 West 4th. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://www.nme.com/festivals/photos/bob-dylan-and-johnny-cash-photographed-by-don-hunstein/150113/2/1">Hunstein said</a>, &quot;It was the first time I&apos;d shot him. I asked him to walk away about 50 feet from me, turn around and walk to me. Because it was cold we didn&#x2019;t take terribly much time, but we were lucky to get what got we got.&quot; </p>

<p>Two years after we originally revisted this album cover, Rotolo told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/arts/music/11decu.html?_r=1">the NY Times</a> that Dylan &quot;wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage.&quot; And in her memoir she wrote, &quot;It is one of those cultural markers that influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility. Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums. Whoever was responsible for choosing that particular photograph really had an eye for a new look.&quot;</p>

<p>It also inspired Dylan&apos;s fans&#x2014;NY Times critic Janet Maslin once wrote that the photograph &quot;inspired countless young men to hunch their shoulders, look distant, and let the girl do the clinging.&quot; Here&apos;s an alternate take from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103100/https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photo/default.aspx?photographID=7295">Morrison Hotel Gallery</a> in NYC:</p>

<p>The first song on the album became one of Dylan&apos;s most celebrated, &quot;Blowin&apos; in the Wind&quot;:</p>
