<p>It&apos;s always great to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175517/http://gothamist.com/tags/wewantourmtv">remember a time</a> when MTV wasn&apos;t a terrible, endless cycle of pregnant teen reality shows, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175517/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/mtv_wants_to_document_your_drunkore.php">drunkorexia docs</a>, cut-off music videos by whatever bands the kids are listening to these days, and energy drink commercials. <em>Everything&apos;s so flashy now!</em> So what better way to revisit the simpler times of the 1990s than through Daria, who would totally hate 2013 MTV.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175517/http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6904493/daria-movie-trailer-with-aubrey-plaza">fake trailer for a <em>Daria</em> movie</a> stars Aubrey Plaza, casting so perfect that we would put aside our criticism of celebrity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175517/http://gothamist.com/tags/kickstarter">Kickstarters</a> and totally support a Daria movie Kickstarter if Aubrey Plaza promised to star. Until that magical day comes, enjoy this trailer:</p>
