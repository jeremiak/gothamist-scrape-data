<p>Not to be a downer about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125155006/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/giant_stuffed_teddy_bear_coming_to.php">the giant yellow &quot;stuffed&quot; teddy bear</a> that has just arrived in gray ol&apos; New York City, but, wouldn&apos;t it be a lot nicer if it didn&apos;t look like it was getting electrocuted? It&apos;s just that... it looks like Paddington Bear is in the electric chair, or, best case scenario, getting a perm.</p>

<p>In reality, the Urs Fischer piece (which will be on auction at Christie&apos;s next month) is supposed to be a bear leaning against a desk lamp. But what kind of careless child would put their beloved teddy bear under a hot lamp? The kind with an overactive imagination that was pretending the lamp was an electric chair, <em>that&apos;s what kind.</em> </p>

<p>If you want to check it out in person, this guy is parked in front of the Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue, between East 52nd and East 53rd streets.</p>
