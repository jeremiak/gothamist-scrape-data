<p>Infinite emails (all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161504/http://twintowers101.blogspot.com/2008/07/beijing-olympics-city-still-shows-twin.html">from the same source</a>) flooded inboxes citywide last night (following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161504/http://search.us.reuters.com/query/?s=USPHOTOS&amp;q=%22beijing+world+park%22">a Reuters photo</a> that was published) with messages pondering &quot;how Americans would feel if they knew that just before the Olympics start, a theme park in Beijing still shows the Twin Towers standing in a NYC exhibit of mini models?&quot; With many Americans already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161504/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/tony_avella_ral.php">protesting the Olympic Games</a>, this might not help the Chinese government&apos;s boffo P.R campaign. </p>

<p>The World Trade Center is still depicted in many things, however, and this particular model went  up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161504/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spectators/beijing/tourism/list/n214068433.shtml">in World Park</a> in 1995. Should the memory of the past skyline and all trinkets from the pre-9/11 era be destroyed by now? Think of all the snow globes, old photos and t-shirts out there. On the flip side, Curbed notes that even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161504/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/07/08/wtc_redevelopment_going_just_fine_in_china.php">Legoland</a> has replaced the Twin Towers with the Freedom Tower. Maybe now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161504/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/04/obama-says-bush.html">Bush will join in on the Olympic boycott</a>, unless he sees this as an opportunity to reinvigorate his presidency by visiting the park and staging a miniature &quot;Never Forget&quot; ceremony, with a miniature bullhorn.</p>
