<p>In 2009 Paul McCartney took the stage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085831/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/18/sir_paul_proves_himself_king_of_queens_once_again.php#photo-1">at Citi Field</a>, and of course, 44 years before <em>that</em> he was playing the now legendary Shea Stadium concert with The Beatles. It&apos;s just been announced, however, that McCartney is playing for a different team this year, with a concert at Yankee Stadium on July 15th. This will be his debut at the stadium, and we&apos;re told tickets go on sale Monday June 13th at 11 a.m., for those who want to join him. The concert kicks off his new On The Run tour, but check out some vintage Macca at Shea, below:</p>
