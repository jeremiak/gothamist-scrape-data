										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="trailerparkbk1209.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604040020im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/trailerparkbk1209.jpg" width="325" height="212" class="image-left"> </span>It <em>feels</em> like this idea already happened when everyone was drinking PBR and wearing trucker hats, but it appears the hipsters of The Aughts weren&apos;t committed enough to actually l-i-v-i-n&apos; the dream all the way to the trailer park. However, with a new decade, comes a new breed: the Bushwick Trailer Park Artist. Add them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604040020/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/12/the-evolution-of-the-hipster-2000-2009.html">the evolution chart</a>.</p>

<p>Move over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604040020/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/tent_city_brooklyn.php">alternative-living amateurs</a>, this is a real deal trailer park, right in Brooklyn... and dare we say, if their plan pans out, it sounds sort of amazing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604040020/http://www.rentedspaces.com/2009/12/21/bushwick-trailer-park-welcomes-artists/">Rented Spaces</a> reports the trailers are currently housed in a 6,500-square-foot former nut roasting factory in Bushwick. If that sounds drab, then just picture the future &#x2014; shiny as an Airstream &#x2014; which promises a relocation to a 20x200-foot backyard. Currently there are six trailers, but by the Spring relocation they expect to have up to thirty 250-square-foot trailers. Eventually they also plan to repurpose boats, railroad cars and shipping containers.</p>

<p>Rentals are on a month-to-month basis, and you get your own camper plus access to bathrooms (which include showers), a darkroom, recording studio, performance space, gym, storage area, screen printing room &#x2014; and workshops for ceramic, metal and woodworking will also be made available. All that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604040020/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/roo/1519108315.html">for just $590/month</a>! </p>

<p>Co-founder Hayden Cummings (who will help hand select tenants) promises, &quot;We&apos;re not doing a reality show here&quot; &#x2014; but if those trailers are rockin&apos;, MTV&apos;s gonna come a knockin&apos;.</p>
