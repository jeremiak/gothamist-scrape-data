<p>A massive light switch was installed at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081613/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/father-demo-square">Father Demo Square</a> near Bleecker Street recently by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081613/http://improveverywhere.com/2015/12/02/the-light-switch/">Improv Everywhere</a> crew, and it was MAGIC. The 7-foot-tall switch was flicked on by curious passersby, and the entire square was illuminated with twinkly lights. The people in the square, too:</p>

<blockquote>When a random New Yorker flipped the switch, the entire square lit up with Christmas lights. In addition to lights on the trees, benches, and fences around the park, a mob of performers wearing lights wrapped around their clothes lit up as well. The performers were instructed to turn on their lights and freeze in place when the switch was flipped on.</blockquote>

<p>Behold the feel-good prank of the season:</p>
