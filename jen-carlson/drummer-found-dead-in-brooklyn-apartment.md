                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="troydrummer1209.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010307im_/http://gothamist.com/troydrummer1209.jpg" width="200" height="265" class="image-right"> </span>This morning the body of 29-year-old drummer Troy Young (of the band  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010307/http://www.myspace.com/curiousmishap">Curious Mishap</a>) was found dead, with a bullet wound in his head, inside of his Carroll Gardens apartment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010307/http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/110314/drummer-found-fatally-shot-in-carroll-gardens-apartment">NY1 reports</a> that police are currently investigating the shooting death. They only discovered the body this morning, after receiving a missing persons report.</p>

<p>Young was found in his 4th Street basement apartment just after midnight, where his front door was open. A neighbor told the network, &quot;I see him every day. He says hello, he&apos;s always happy, smiling, see him at deli, he has coffee, egg sandwiches. He always asks me, &#x2018;how you doing on the project?&#x2019;&quot; Another neighbor told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010307/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/musician_found_dead_in_brooklyn_3ISmF0JQaWufygUNCs5kFL">the Post</a>, &quot;I saw him on Tuesday, and everything was good. He was laughing. He&#x2019;s a very quiet guy. He&#x2019;d have some people over sometimes on Fridays or Saturdays, one or two, not a lot. He was a no problem guy.&quot;</p>

<p>At this time no arrests have been made.</p>
