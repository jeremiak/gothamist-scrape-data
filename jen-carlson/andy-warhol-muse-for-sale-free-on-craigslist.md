Someone in Brooklyn is offering up this Andy Warhol muse for the bargain price of zero dollars, and they&apos;ll even meet you in a convenient location for the exchange. They write:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;It&#x2019;s a classic, it may even be considered vintage, I mean Andy Warhol was a huge fan and look where it got him. Here we have this formerly delicious can of Campbell&#x2019;s Chicken Noodle Soup just for you. Now I&#x2019;m not offering it to you as just a can of soup but more as a paperweight or a bookend because as I discovered it is actually now considered vintage, because this particular can of soup was born in 1997... I think it might make a lovely addition to your bookshelf but I highly recommend that you probably don&#x2019;t eat it.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&apos;t really seem like the can&apos;s design has changed much since 1997 though. Wonder where the Andy Warhol Foundation stands on all of this...
