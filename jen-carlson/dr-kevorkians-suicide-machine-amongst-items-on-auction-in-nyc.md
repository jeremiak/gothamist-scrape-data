<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="kevorkianmachine1011.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021103146im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/kevorkianmachine1011.jpg" width="320" height="240" class="image-right"> </span>Next Friday, the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian&apos;s personal effects will be on the auction block right here in New York City. 140 of his items, including paintings he created with his own blood and the machine he used in more than 100 assisted suicides, will be on the block at the New York Institute of Technology. As comedian Todd Barry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021103146/http://www.whosay.com/toddbarry/photos/81742">tweeted last night</a>, this is a great date idea if you&apos;re in the NYC area!</p>

<p>There are some last minute hitches, however&#x2014;with <a href+'http:="" www.google.com="" hostednews="" ap="" article="" aleqm5jqx6cztys1rdkdszh06fivgd0jtg?docid="8dbd85cef9d345e7a77b867fb7549722&quot;">the AP</a> reporting that The Armenian Library and Museum of America in Massachusetts &quot;is refusing to surrender <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021103146/http://www.oddthingsiveseen.com/2010/04/photo-essay-paintings-of-jack-kevorkian.html">17 paintings</a> and other artwork by Kevorkian, saying he donated them to it and his estate has no right to claim them nearly 12 years after it put them on display.&quot; The estate claims the paintings could be worth around $3.5 million.</p>

<p>As of now, there will still be nearly 140 items on the block next week, and nothing says Halloween like a disturbing painting titled &quot;Genocide&quot; created in Dr. Death&apos;s very own blood. Get there by 6 p.m. for the good stuff!</p>
