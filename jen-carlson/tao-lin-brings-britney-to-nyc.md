The simple black &amp; white design is littering the city, and it&apos;s not part of Brit&apos;s plan to gain some street cred. </p>

<p>Author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065751/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/17/tao_lin_author.php">Tao Lin</a> has his interns putting them up as a promotional tactic for his new book. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065751/http://www.psychopedia.com/dailynews/2008/05/famous_author_tao_linon_britne.html">Psychopedia</a> recently asked him about the origins of the idea:</p><blockquote>On gmail chat I said something like, &quot;I should make stickers that say BRITNEY SPEARS on half of it and my book cover on the other half to promote the book.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Then that got &quot;edited&quot; to just &quot;BRITNEY SPEARS.&quot; I feel really good about the stickers.</p></blockquote>He says that hipsters are more his target audience than &#x201C;people in therapy,&quot; however maybe Brit would enjoy his latest release anyway, titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065751/http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Poetry-Tao-Lin/dp/1933633484/?tag=gothamist03-20">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</a>.<p></p>

<p>Britney&apos;s also been seen in New York on the small screen, with some recent cameos on the Manhattan-based show <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065751/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfioaUfZK8I">YouTube</a>).</p>
