Farley Post Office on 8th Avenue to kick off the annual Letters to Santa program. The letter adoption program enables &quot;members of the public and charitable organizations to respond to children&#x2019;s letters addressed to Santa Claus, the North Pole and other seasonal characters.&quot; </p>

<p>Last year the program came to a halt after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111016063907/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/19/operation_santa_ceases_due_to_priva.php">a &quot;Bad Santa&quot; situation</a> was pointed out by a USPS letter carrier. Let&apos;s hope that doesn&apos;t happen again this year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111016063907/http://www.operationlettertosanta.com/Pages/new-york-operation-santa-claus.htm">Here are details</a> on how to participate. And Fozzie the Bear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111016063907/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delivering-dreams-one-letter-at-a-time-78229787.html">says</a>, &quot;Helping Santa Claus is always a good idea, especially at this time of year.&quot;</p>

<p>In other Muppet news, the NYPL&apos;s Staten Island Huguenot Park Branch will be screening <em>Muppet&#x2019;s From Space</em> on December 10th (5 p.m.); and Symphony Space will be screening both <em>The Muppet Movie</em> (December 26th) and <em>The Muppets Take Manhattan</em> (January 2nd). More details on the latter screenings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111016063907/http://www.symphonyspace.org/genre/family">here</a>.</p>
