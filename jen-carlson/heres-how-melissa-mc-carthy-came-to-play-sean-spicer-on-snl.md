<p>This season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021201/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> has been running some real time commentary alongside the real life dystopian follies playing out at the White House. Kent Sublette is one of the head writers charged with bringing the insane news of the week out of Washington/Mar-a-lago/Twitter to the show, and was the staffer behind bringing us one of this season&apos;s most inspired moments in casting: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021201/http://gothamist.com/tags/melissamccarthy">Melissa McCarthy</a> as Sean Spicer. </p>

<p>McCarthy has now brilliantly portrayed Spicer twice (Trump, apparently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021201/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/trump_spicer_mccarthy_snl.php">does not approve</a>), and will be back behind the press secretary&apos;s podium when she hosts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021201/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/16/melissa_mccarthy_the_rock_jimmy_fal.php">on May 13th</a>. (And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021201/http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/sean-spicer-beware-melissa-mccarthy-snl-impression.html">she&apos;s been taking notes</a>!) In a recent chat with Ellen Degeneres, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021201/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/melissa-mccarthy-sean-spicer-snl-1202015605/">McCarthy explained</a> that it all came to be when Sublette caller her, asking, &quot;Do you have any interest in coming in and doing Spicer for us?&quot; The rest is comedic history (and sadly also commentary on real life America). </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the <em>Ellen</em> clip, where McCarthy discussed her Spicey costume: &#x201C;I look so much like my dad. I feel like my dad and Sean Spicer had a baby, and it&#x2019;s me. Which makes it even stranger.&#x201D;</p>
