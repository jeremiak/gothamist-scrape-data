<p>The fifth season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033644/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> is finally right around the corner (assuming it will air in <em>early</em> 2012), and the show&apos;s creator, Matthew Weiner, has set the publicity wheels in motion by talking about how it&apos;s all gonna end once we hit season seven. Warning: given the extreme reaction we got in the office when we sent this link around (<em>sorry everyone</em>), you may consider what follows to be a SPOILER. In a recent interview, Weiner told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033644/http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/37420/matthew-weiner-on-all-the-people-who-crossed-him-%E2%80%94-plus-how-mad-men-will-end">Grantland</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;I do know how the whole show ends. It came to me in the middle of last season. I always felt like it would be the experience of human life. And human life has a destination. It doesn&apos;t mean Don&apos;s gonna die. What I&apos;m looking for, and how I hope to end the show, is like... It&apos;s 2011. Don Draper would be 84 right now. I want to leave the show in a place where you have an idea of what it meant and how it&apos;s related to you.&quot;</blockquote>And if you don&apos;t like that Weiner basically just spoiled the ending for you, keep it to yourself, he also says, &quot;Don&apos;t write on the Internet what I&apos;m allowed to fucking do.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033644/http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2011/11/matthew-weiner-gives-away-mad-men-ending/44960/">Atlantic Wire</a>]<p></p>
