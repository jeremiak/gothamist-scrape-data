                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="fbibuilding0809.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222157im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/fbibuilding0809.jpg" width="300" height="251" class="image-left"> </span>Just when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222157/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/29/nypd_defends_photographers_rights.php">it looked like</a> The Man was standing up for photographer&apos;s rights, or at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222157/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/nypd_get_lesson_in_photography.php">understanding the law</a>, things have gone sour again. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222157/http://carlosmiller.com/2009/08/20/homeland-security-arrests-man-for-filming-fbi-building-in-nyc/">Carlos Miller</a> reports that 43-year-old professional photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222157/http://www.srandallthomas.com/">Randall Thomas</a> &quot;was jailed for six hours&#x2014;and had his camera and memory card confiscated by a judge&#x2014;after filming an FBI building from across the street in New York City Monday.&quot;</p>

<p>He was standing at the corner of Duane Street and Broadway and was doing a pan of the building with his video camera when he was accosted by security. When Homeland Security was called in and asked what he was filming, he said, &quot;<strong>That&#x2019;s none of your business</strong>.&quot; Probably the magic words that landed him behind bars for six hours. They brought him up to the 10th floor of the building he was filming, and placed him in a holding cell, charging him with disorderly conduct, failure to comply and impeding duties of a federal officer. They also got a judge to sign a search warrant, which allowed them to confiscate his camera and memory card, neither of which were returned.</p>

<p>Previously Thomas had been arrested for taking a photograph of the same building, but he never heard back about the case after pleading not guilty.</p>
