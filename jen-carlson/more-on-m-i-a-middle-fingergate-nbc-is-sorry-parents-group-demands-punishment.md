										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="smmiafinger.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205115im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smmiafinger.jpeg" width="300" height="321"> <br> <i>The money shot (via the AP)</i></div> Last night, <em>as you know by now</em>, M.I.A. flipped off America during the Super Bowl halftime show. But seriously, everyone, someone made her wear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205115/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/madonnas_super_bowl_halftime_lfmao.php#photo-2">a cheerleading outfit</a>&#x2014;if M.I.A. <em>didn&apos;t</em> flip off someone, life just wouldn&apos;t make sense anymore. However, since nothing else controversial really happened&#x2014;and the wardrobe malfunction thing was eight years ago&#x2014;we, as a people, needed <em>something</em> to talk about at the water cooler. And M.I.A. delivered, albeit subtly.<p></p>

<p>In the aftermath of the second-long flash of the middle finger, NBC has apologized to viewers &quot;for the inappropriate gesture that aired during halftime. It was a spontaneous gesture that our delay system caught late.&#x201D; And the NFL is also talking, pointing the finger at the network, saying: &#x201C;There was a failure in NBC&#x2019;s delay system. The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Those apologies aren&apos;t good enough for the TV watchdog group the Parents Television Council, however. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205115/http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/06/parents-org-mia-nbc-ngfl-enabled-offensive-halftime/#.Ty_rsONWq-0">TMZ</a> reports that the organization feels that NBC enabled M.I.A. to flip off the camera, and in doing so FAILED AMERICA. In a statement, they said, &quot;It is unfortunate that a spectacular sporting event was overshadowed once again by broadcasting the selfish acts of a desperate performer. Either the NFL and NBC will take immediate steps to hold those accountable for this offensive material in front of a hundred million Americans, or they will feebly sit back and do nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205115/http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/super-bowl-half-time-show-controversy-prompts-apologies-from-nbc-nfl/#more-226192">Deadline</a>, M.I.A. also dropped a &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t give a shit&#x201D; during the performance with Madonna and Nicki Minaj, but it was inaudible. The performer has yet to release her own statement, but we&apos;re guessing if she does, it&apos;ll be similar to the above photo.</p>
