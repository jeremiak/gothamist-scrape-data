Since the demolition project needs to be met with public approval it might not bode well that the construction &quot;would entail building over the railroad tracks that run beneath the hotel and pose engineering and security challenges.&quot; However it seems like a done deal, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706144853/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/business/25lynch.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">the NY Times</a> reported today that &quot;Merrill Lynch has been negotiating with Vornado over the terms of a billion-dollar 65-year lease that would give the company control of the half-block hotel site.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706144853/http://www.observer.com/2007/lonely-fight-hotel-pennsylvania">The Observer</a> also had a piece earlier this month on the hotel&apos;s past and impending future, when the scaffolding started to go up. While the hotel, which was built in 1919, had its glory days, it&apos;s far from what it used to be now. The only thing that has stayed the same is the famous phone number (the New York phone number in longest continuous use): Pennsylvania 6-5000, also inspiration for the Glenn Miller song. Besides that, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and the Glenn Miller Orchestra -- who all played the hotel&apos;s ballroom -- have been replaced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706144853/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/01/bedded.php">bed bugs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706144853/http://curbed.com/archives/2007/10/10/preservationists_shun_unloved_hotel_pennsylvania.php">sub par conditions</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706144853/http://www.nationaltrust.org/Magazine/archives/arc_news_2007/010807.htm">Preservation Online</a> has a quote from Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, who stated &quot;It holds a lot of cultural resonance with the city because of all the big bands that played there, but the inside has been pretty much stripped. I don&apos;t think anyone who has stayed there recently has been overly in love with the place.&quot;</p>

<p>Think it&apos;s worth saving? The committee of the local Community Board 5 will meet October 30th to see if the hotel merits landmark status. If the hotel gets demolished, expect the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706144853/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=37692">Vornado Tower</a> to be up by 2011...but where will the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706144853/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/12/the_131st_westm.php">Westminster pups</a> stay?!</p>
