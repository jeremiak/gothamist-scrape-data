Forget your typical night of drinks, music or being parked in front of your tv for the latest Project Runway episode. Head over to Union Hall for some science! Each event brings out the inner-nerd in all of us, and recently we asked the founders a few questions about their brainchild. The next event is December 5th, which gives you a week to study up.</em></p>

<p><strong>What do you do when you&apos;re not working on Secret Science Night? How did you get interested in the field?</strong><br>
Dorian: I&apos;m an acquisitions editor for technical science books, interview scholars and scientists for special podcasts, host karaoke, and throw parties. I&apos;m also the host of a radio talk on WFMU called the Speakeasy.</p>

<p>Michael: Margaret and I write about natural history. Our most recent book is &quot;Carnivorous Nights: On the Trail of the Tasmanian Tiger,&quot; which is about our search for an extinct marsupial predator.</p>

<p><strong>When did the Secret Science Club begin at Union Hall?</strong><br>
Margaret: In July 2006, we started talking with Andy Templar and Jim Carden, the owners of Union Hall, about having a special event there. We went in while the bar was still under construction--and it looked like a funky Masonic hall or explorer&apos;s club. And then somebody--I think it was Andy--said totally off the cuff, &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be great to have a science night here?&quot;</p>

<p>Dorian: When Andy mentioned wanting to do a science night, I told him I had wanted to do science brunches back when I had started a nonprofit (for public understanding of science). I thought it would be quite simple to get some well-known scientists to agree to give talks, since I had had success in getting them on my old radio program and involved in various other projects I&apos;ve worked on. It seemed something that, between Margaret, Michael, &amp; I , we should have been able to put together without too much trouble.</p>

<p>Michael: The first Secret Science Club was in September 2006--and we&apos;ve been having events at least once a month since.</p>
