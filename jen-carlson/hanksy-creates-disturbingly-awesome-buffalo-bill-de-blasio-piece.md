<p>Our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111117/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">next Mayor</a> has been given the street art treatment by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111117/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a>, who mashed him up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111117/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-ac87-6n3I">Buffalo Bill</a> to create the Buffalo Bill de Blasio of our nightmares. It is truly disturbing. Hanksy told us this morning, &quot;The emperor and his new clothes are both tucked away on a small Chinatown street. Creepy as all get out, but oddly alluring. No?&quot;</p>
