<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045522/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045522/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/banksy_says_latest_greenpoint_piece.php">in Greenpoint</a> surprisingly survived the hand of taggers during its 24+ hours in existence, but this morning an older woman armed with a mask, a hard hat, and silver paint came and painted right over it. Maybe she didn&apos;t like the criticism the artist offered about One World Trade Center? We&apos;ll update when we know more...</p>
