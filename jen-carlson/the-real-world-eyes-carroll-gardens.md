Sorry Carroll Gardens, looks like the network has their eye on you. </p>

<p>A property owner in the &apos;nabe says he&apos;s in negotiations which may land the seven strangers into his &quot;gorgeous, six-story, five-unit, gut-renovated brick rowhouse on Third Place (once ranked #23 in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312202617/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/features/4107/the-rankings-21-30">ToNY&apos;s</a> best blocks list). Just how <em>real</em> is this rumor?</p><blockquote>&#x201C;We entered into negotiations,&#x201D; the property owner said. &#x201C;We finalized some negotiations at least six weeks ago. My understanding was that MTV did approve the location, but we&#x2019;re still in negotiations.&#x201D;</blockquote>The show&apos;s producer Jim Johnston confirms they&apos;re looking at Carroll Gardens. If they move in, the pampered bunch will be treated to an elevator building with &quot;new appliances, mahogany floors, a cool, hip, 1970s vibe.&quot; Each of the five units would normally get $1M or more on the market. <p></p>
