But while many of us don&apos;t even feel the need to filter our water through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428003708/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/13/do_you_brita.php">a Brita</a>, we don&apos;t actually have <em>The Best</em> tasting water according to <em>some people</em>. No, that title has just been handed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428003708/http://www.jsonline.com/business/96925609.html">Stevens Point, Wisconsin</a> (pop. 25,000).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428003708/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/06/22/new-yorks-tap-water-defeated-by-tiny-wisconsin-town/">Wall Street Journal</a> reports that we <em>did</em>, however, come in 2nd&#x2014;the highest honor the city has received at the American Water Works Association&#x2019;s annual contest&#x2014;where winners are declared following taste-test competitions. The NYC Environmental Protection Commissioner Cas Holloway declared: &#x201C;[this] confirms a fact that locals have known for decades: New York City water is simply the best.&#x201D; Er, simply the 2nd best. </p>

<p>Bet you can&apos;t make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428003708/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/10/florida_baker_recreates_brooklyn_wa.php">a good bagel</a> with any Wisconsin water, though... plus, who knows what kind of unsophisticated palettes were judging this thing.</p>
