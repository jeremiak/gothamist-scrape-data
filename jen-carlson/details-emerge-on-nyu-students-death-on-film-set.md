										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:275px; "> <img alt="phpXlbw0pPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109084026im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpXlbw0pPM.jpg" width="275" height="206"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Lamensdorf</span></i></div> With litigation pending, NYU has been keeping mum regarding the death of student John Hunt Lamensdorf, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109084026/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2009/05/29/john-lamensdorf-nyu-class-of-2009-dies-working-on-film-project/">died on set</a> last May while helping with another student&apos;s film project. The university has also been urging others not to talk about the incident publicly, but now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109084026/http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-04-06/news/nyu-s-snuff-film/">the Village Voice</a> has a lengthy account of what happened on the Georgia set, directly from someone who was there: Jason Welin. <p></p>

<p>Welin was hired for $350, and was at the controls of the aerial lift that hit power lines which caused a powerful explosion resulting in Lamensdorf&apos;s electrocution. He described the events, noting that Lamensdorf was setting up a 1,000 watt light on the other side of the dilapidated house they were filming at when Welin made contact with the wires above the lift, causing Lamensdorf&apos;s electrocution; &quot;he was bleeding from his nose and mouth&quot; when his friend Andres Cardona started CPR, and ultimately he died. </p>

<p>Now his parents are suing NYU, NES Rentals (for renting the lift &quot;to inexperienced college students&quot;), an NYU professor, Welin, Pen Pals Productions, the producers of the film, and classmates who were on the shoot, including Cardona, who tried to save their son. Welin&apos;s response? &quot;That&apos;s great, that&apos;s just fucking great. I already feel bad enough that people are saying I have blood on my hands, and now to be sued? It really makes you feel like a piece of shit.&quot;</p>

<p>For their part, NYU has declined to discuss if they&apos;ve added a dedicated safety course to the the curriculum. Tisch School of the Arts will be screening Lamensdorf&apos;s short film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109084026/http://www.firstrunfestival.com/">this Sunday</a>, however, titled <em>Only Criminals</em>.</p>
