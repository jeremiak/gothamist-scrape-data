<p>We heard some would-be MoMA patrons grumbling over Twitter this weekend about not getting in to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152057/http://gothamist.com/tags/rainroom">Rain Room</a>&#x2014;the installation that&apos;s become to the art world what Cronuts have become to the pastry world. In fact... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152057/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/18/cronut_creator_brings_cronut_in_to.php">oh nevermind</a>. Anyway, with the end of the installation quickly approaching (you have until July 28th), mass hypesteria has taken ahold of the city, and the city&apos;s tourists. The lines are getting so out of control that at this point all you might see <em>is</em> the line. If you&apos;re part of the General Public you almost don&apos;t stand a chance, and even those who have purchased an $85 membership are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152057/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/waiting_on_line_for_momas_rain_room.php">in for a very long wait</a>:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="smRAINROOM0713.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152057im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smRAINROOM0713.jpg" width="308" height="300"> <br> <i style=" width:308px; ;display:block"> Photo by Katie Sokoler/Gothamist</i></div> But at least you&apos;ll be warned early that you won&apos;t get in&#x2014;this morning one MoMA rep told us, &quot;The lines are closing early in the day for both members and the general public&#x2014;we are still accommodating 1,200 + visitors per day, though. People are just coming earlier which means capacity is reached earlier.&quot; On Saturday, that meant that around 9 a.m. the General Public was being told they didn&apos;t have a shot of getting in. But <em>whatareyougonnado</em>, you know? There aren&apos;t that many solutions to this problem, aside from building more Rain Rooms.<p></p>

<p>However, as part of the General Public you&apos;re not just competing with Members... you&apos;re competing with a secret procession of VIPs. A MoMA insider told us over the weekend that some VIPs are getting in without waiting on line, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152057/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/the_artist_is_present_for_vips.php">just like they did for Marina Abramovi&#x107;</a>: &quot;The general public line was closed [on Saturday] because the member line was too long, wrapping around the block and then some, and became too long of a wait, since the Rain Room closes when the museum does, so there would not be time to let GP in. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Additionally, there is a special VIP entrance on 53rd street, where the exit is, but you need a special ticket that isn&apos;t easy to get. I am pretty sure the only way to get a VIP ticket is through someone that works for MoMA.</strong> The line is going to get wild for the last week, so I wouldn&apos;t put it past them to close off the line really early in the day, or to shut it off to GP, simply just due to time restrictions.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;re dispatching someone to test out the &quot;get there early and you&apos;ll get in&quot; theory this week, and will be documenting every second of it. Stay tuned...</p>
