<p>Last year, after Arcade Fire won a Grammy, the Twitter machine lit up with inquiries asking: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100556/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/14/arcade_fire_1.php">Who is Arcade Fire?</a> A Tumblr was started, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100556/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/video_who_is_arcade_fire_psa.php">PSA was made</a>, and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100556/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/21/fyi_tom_colicchio_knows_who_arcade.php">Tom Colicchio weighed in</a> for some reason. Well, last night when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100556/http://boniver.org/">Bon Iver</a> took home a Grammy for Best New Artist (despite putting out albums since 2007) and Best Alternative Music Album, it was d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu all over again. Are these confused people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100556/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/10/bon_iver_at_the_united_palace_a_sch.php">Bon Curious or Bon Averse</a>? Who knows, but they&apos;re Tweeting... and yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100556/http://who-is-bon-iver.tumblr.com/">there&apos;s a Tumblr</a> keeping track of them all (it&apos;s been around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602100556/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/01/five_grammy_nominations_worth_carin.php">since they were nominated</a>).</p>
