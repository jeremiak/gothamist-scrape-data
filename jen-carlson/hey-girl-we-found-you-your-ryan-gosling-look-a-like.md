<p>Recently a flyer was spotted in Brooklyn stating that the woman pictured was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617164019/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/11/ryan_gosling_1.php">looking for Ryan Gosling</a>... or someone that looks like him, at least. Turns out dreams <em>do</em> come true: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617164019/https://twitter.com/#!/joeythompson23">Joey Thompson</a>, a.k.a. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617164019/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/video_how_to_look_like_ryan_gosling.php">the Ryan Gosling look-a-like guy</a>, has just been found, and is ready to be delivered. </p>

<p>Thompson actually found himself (<em>deep</em>), and sent us his own flyer, which declares: &quot;Found him talking about some washed up viral video he made. Please take him back if you know him...&quot;</p>

<p>People, we may have a love connection here... and it sounds like the woman pictured on the flyer may need some cheering up&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617164019/http://www.thefrisky.com/2012-06-12/the-real-story-behind-that-ryan-gosling-look-a-like-flyer/">The Frisky</a> says the flyer was an effort to make her smile after her boyfriend left her.</p>
