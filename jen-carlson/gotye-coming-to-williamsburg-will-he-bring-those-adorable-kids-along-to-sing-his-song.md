Today the Open Space Alliance (OSA) announced their next act for the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601084945/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/welcome_to_williamsburg_park.php">Williamsburg Park</a>, and it&apos;s Gotye! <p></p>

<p>Tickets for the show, which will be September 27th, go on sale next Friday June 8th, and will cost $42. Other ticketed shows at the outdoor venue include Cake, Cypress Hill with Sublime, and My Morning Jacket. And while it&apos;s true that the Gotye show was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601084945/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=371099196286844&amp;set=a.326201130776651.77970.323979554332142&amp;type=1">just announced</a>, this was really just an excuse to finally post that adorable video of kids singing his single, &quot;Somebody That I Used To Know.&quot; (Seriously, watch it.)</p>

<p>Gotye will also play at Radio City Music Hall (with Missy Higgins &amp; Jonti) on September 25th.</p>
