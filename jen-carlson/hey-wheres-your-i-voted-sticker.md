<p>While some native New Yorkers have never even seen an &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker during their voting lifetimes, <em>they have existed</em>. There seem to be people out there who did get an &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker today... and not the one included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122134/http://snarkattack.tumblr.com/post/35124966869/no-sticker-at-my-polling-place-amnys-will-have">in this morning&apos;s AMNY</a>, either. The following were all presumably acquired at New York City polling places (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122134/https://twitter.com/meganmasek/status/265829153339748352">it&apos;s possible</a> some of these people made or purchased their own):</p>

<p>Some longtime New Yorkers tell us the NYC &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker is a myth, others tell us they saw them at polling places years and years ago, and less frequently since then. <strike>We&apos;re trying to definitively confirm if the NYC voting sticker exists or not, but in the meantime:</strike> [UPDATE: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122134/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/wheres_your_i_voted_sticker.php#comment-701871372">THEY EXIST</a>!] Did you get a sticker today? Let us know where in the comments.</p>

<p>And, PSSST: for those companies offering free goods for showing your &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker... you may want to alter your offer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122134/http://dcist.com/2012/11/more_illegal_election_day_food.php">so it&apos;s less illegal</a>.</p>
