<p>While Forbes named NYC as one of the top singles cities in America <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113420/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/26/single_in_the_c.php">last year</a>, it turns out the reason why there are so many singles here is because women outnumber men by roughly 210,000. Things are not looking good, ladies. Apparently we are living in the worst &quot;mating market&quot; in the country! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113420/http://creativeclass.typepad.com/thecreativityexchange/2007/04/the_singles_map.html">Richard Florida</a>, the author of <em>Who&#x2019;s Your City?</em>, delivers this news through the above map (which appeared in National Geographic). Perhaps this will deter any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113420/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/sjp_warns_futur.php">future Carries</a> from moving to Manhattan in hopes of meeting their own Mr. Big. </p>
