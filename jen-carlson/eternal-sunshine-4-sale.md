<p>The house at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044020/http://gothamist.com/tags/eternalsunshineofthespotlessmind">59 Orient Avenue</a> in Brooklyn has seen brighter days. After being featured in <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, as Kate Winslet&apos;s apartment, the 1899 era home quickly turned into a Club Med for meth addicts and squatters alike&#x2014;which predictably didn&apos;t please the neighbors. But the house just went back on the market, and now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044020/http://gothamist.com/tags/michelgondry">Michel Gondry</a> is living on the block, is there hope? Will the director be unable to bare the sight of his Clementine&apos;s home getting turned over to the riff raff again? Probably. But just incase, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044020/http://flavorwire.com/28010/an-open-letter-to-michel-gondry-buy-this-house">Flavorwire</a> has pleaded with him to purchase it. Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044020/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2008/02/house-of-day-orient-avenue-fixer-upper.html">some interior shots</a> from the last time it was up for grabs&#x2014;Gondry&apos;s imagination may be the only thing that can save this place.</p>
