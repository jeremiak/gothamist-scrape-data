Why? He was forced to write his name down by the cop, which is against the rules on the Sabbath; he told the paper, &quot;This was the first time in my life I broke the Sabbath. It was disgraceful.&quot;</p>

<p>Emert wasn&apos;t carrying identification, and says the cop told him &quot;You have to write [your name] down, and it has to be done very neatly so I can read it. If I can&apos;t read it, I&apos;m going to have to take you in.&quot; Though Emert explained, &quot; I can&apos;t write today,&quot; he was still forced to do it because he &quot;had no choice. When someone [threatens to] put you in cuffs, you can be [detained for] 24 hours. I have a wife and four kids at home.&quot; Things to think about <em>before</em> breaking the law?</p>
