<p>A year after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503163329/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/04/joan_rivers_dead_81.php#photo-1">her mother&apos;s death</a>, Melissa Rivers took the role of Joan Rivers in David O. Russell&apos;s film <em>Joy</em>. A clip of her portraying her late mother was just released: </p>

<p>Rivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503163329/http://www.etonline.com/movies/177650_exclusive_melissa_rivers_gets_emotional_over_playing_her_late_mom_joan_joy_watch_the_first_clip/">told ET</a>, &quot;I worked hard on her speech pattern, but not so much the accent because I didn&apos;t want it to be an imitation or a caricature.

<p><em>Joy</em> is about Joy Mangano (played by Jennifer Lawrence), who invented the Miracle Mop, and it hits theaters Christmas day.
