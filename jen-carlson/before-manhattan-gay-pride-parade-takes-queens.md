</div></div><p>Yesterday the 18th annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083659/http://www.queenspride.com/">Queens Pride Parade</a> took over the streets in Jackson Heights, just a few weeks before the big show happens on 5th Avenue in Manhattan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083659/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/06/04/2010-06-04_pride_parade_a_key_stop_for_pols_courting_gay_vote.html">The Daily News</a> called the Queens parade an opportunity for local politicians to gain support amongst the community, who was let down when the state Senate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083659/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/02/same-sex_marriage_bill_passes_in_ne.php">tossed aside the same-sex marriage bill</a> last December. Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), also a parade founder, told the paper, &quot;We&apos;re not going to tolerate having Democratic elected officials who don&apos;t support marriage equality. It&apos;s a basic civil right and they need to recognize it.&quot;</p>

<p>This year the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083659/http://www.nycpride.org/march.html">Pride Parade in Manhattan</a> will be led by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083659/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/gay_pride_1.php">Constance McMillen</a>, who earlier this year was banished from her school&apos;s prom in Mississippi.</p>
