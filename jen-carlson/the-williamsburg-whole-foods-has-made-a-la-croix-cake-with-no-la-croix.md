					<p>Earlier today a patron of the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132516/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/25/photos_whole_foods_williamsburg.php#photo-1">Williamsburg Whole Foods</a> (home to the city&apos;s largest wall of La Croix) discovered a cake in the bakery section in the shape and design of a La Croix box. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132516/https://twitter.com/imbeccable/status/762827233350352896">A photo was Tweeted</a>. Hundreds of people &quot;liked&quot; it. And we immediately sent two members of the Gothamist team to procure the cake. &quot;Take an Uber, there&apos;s no time!&quot; </p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s supermarket bakery correspondents Scott Heins and Sarah Aziza arrived at the Whole Foods around 1:40 p.m. and were told that the cake was not for sale, it was strictly promotional and made from pieces of other, old semi-stale cakes they were going to throw out. This was upsetting news for us, but Whole Foods really nailed this promotional, didn&apos;t they?</p>

<p>Our team bought a few cupcakes with the La Croix logo on top instead ($5/each).</p>

<p>By 1:53 p.m., after fielding questions from our team, the bakery management changed their mind: &quot;New development,&quot; Heins reported back, &quot;The La Croix cake is their new &apos;featured cake&apos; and with 2-3 days&apos; advance notice they will make you one for $80!&quot; What a racket. </p>

<p>The cake can be custom ordered to resemble any flavor, but doesn&apos;t include any sparkling water (which is actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132516/http://waterstories.nestle-waters.com/health/cooking-recipes-with-sparkling-water/">beneficial in baking</a>!). It&apos;s simply dressed up to look like the La Croix box&#x2014;inside you&apos;ll find vanilla cake with buttercream frosting. At the very least, they could make a coconut version, one of the more beloved&#x2014;albeit polarizing&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132516/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/04/whoa_if_true.php">flavors on the market</a>.</p>
