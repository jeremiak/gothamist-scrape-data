The only source of conflict was geographic location...the fest will take place on Staten Island this coming Saturday. For those who can get over the stigma attached to the borough, you&apos;re in for a treat. Pat Duffy, who also runs the blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063005/http://poptartssucktoasted.blogspot.com/">Pop Tarts Suck Toasted</a>, has helped organize a full day of sonic splendor from our SI band brethren -- and it&apos;s all taking place at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063005/http://www.snug-harbor.org/">Snug Harbor Cultural Center</a>. More details on the event can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063005/http://www.rocktheharbor.net/">here</a>, and if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063005/http://rocktheharbor.tix.com/Schedule.asp?OrganizationNumber=1989">buy your tickets</a> before Saturday you&apos;ll save 5 bucks (bring the kids for free!).</em></p>

<p><strong>How did the Rock the Harbor event come about?</strong> Basically a couple of hard working individuals; The Neptune Group and Ben Johnson of the Staten Island Advance in particular, got the idea together to put on an all Staten Island festival featuring the best of the bands we have to offer. I jumped on board to help promote the show outside of Staten Island, we got all of our bands together for the event, and we found ourselves the best location in Staten Island to host it. So it is simply the culmination of a few determined individuals and a slew of really talented bands.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about what we can expect from the festival?</strong> Aside from Across the Narrows nothing like this has ever been tried in Staten Island so we really have no idea what to expect from the event. What we do know is that we have a ton of bands that should impress even the most cynical of cynics, we have a beautiful venue to host the event, and the weather report looks good for Saturday (though I definitely don&apos;t wanna jinx that) so we should have the makings of a tremendous event on our hands! We all really believe that there has never been a better reason to come and check out Staten Island and we&apos;re hoping a lot of people realize that and make the trip over.</p>

<p><strong>Is this something you see growing each year?</strong> In the original planning of the event this year there was talk of inviting some of the bigger indie bands out to try and draw people in, but it was decided that it would be best to just showcase the best that Staten Island has to offer. But I see no reason that would couldn&apos;t blend the musical resources of the entire city into a huge event here in Staten Island, but if we were looking to keep it solely to local Staten Island bands we might run into a bit of trouble in growing the event. Basically, we need to find some sort of balance and since we&apos;re so confident in the music being put out here in Staten Island I see no problem in blending the local scene with bigger bands and growing this thing as we go along.</p>
