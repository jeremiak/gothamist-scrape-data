<p>Someone that goes by the YouTube handle &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120526012007/http://www.youtube.com/user/Dieseltmmc">Dieseltmmc</a>&quot; has been uploading video from deep inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120526012007/http://gothamist.com/tags/2ndavenuesubway">2nd Avenue subway</a> tunnels, and the latest includes 40 case of dynamite (at 59 sticks to a case) and one &quot;big ass blast!&quot; But the best part comes at the end when one of the workers pulls out a cigarette and can&apos;t find a lighter. Ask the guy with the dynamite?</p>
