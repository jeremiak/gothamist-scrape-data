<p>In the &quot;reality&quot; television show <em>Kourtney &amp; Kim Take New York</em>, the two Kardashian sisters deal with overcoming some of life&apos;s most difficult challenges while maintaining the grace of a spoiled teenager slamming the door in her parents face. Like, what do you do when your sham marriage is falling apart right before America&apos;s eyes? In last night&apos;s finale of the show, you can see just how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517062829/http://gothamist.com/tags/kimkardashian">Kim</a> handled this obstacle in her life&#x2014;as she &quot;falls apart&quot; and &quot;cries&quot; to her sister, acknowledging that she &quot;feels&quot; bad for having wasted everyone&apos;s time and money with her highly publicized wedding vows to Kris Humphries.  </p>

<p>To recap, Kim and Kris started dating in December of 2010, <em>admitted</em> to dating at the end of February 2011, announced their engagement on the cover of People magazine in May, were married in August, and divorced in October, just a couple of weeks after their two-part wedding special aired on E!. Now, when is E! gonna air the episode where Kim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517062829/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/04/kim_kardashian_dated_reggie_watts_a.php">cheats on Reggie Watts</a>?</p>
