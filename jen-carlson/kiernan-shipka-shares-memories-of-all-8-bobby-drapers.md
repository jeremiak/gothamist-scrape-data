<p>Kiernan Shipka, who played Sally Draper on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406050837/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406050837/https://li.st/l/7UUcBiRlFQppDn3WTnqkf4">has listed off</a> her memories of the many actors who played her on-screen brother, Bobby, throughout the series. </p>

<p>Shipka was only 6 years old when she began working on the show, and while she made it all the way to the series finale, she notes that she wasn&apos;t in the pilot&#x2014;&quot;I have no memories of Pilot Bobby... The pilot was filmed in New York and Sally was played by the director&apos;s daughter.&quot; Both Bobby and Sally are only seen at the end of the pilot, when Don returns from Manhattan and looks in on them while they sleep.</p>

<blockquote>MY MEMORIES OF THE BOBBY DRAPERS
<p></p><p> 
Bucket Head Bobby
A little known fact is that this Bobby was an entirely different Bobby. He was anointed &quot;Bucket Head Bobby.&quot; We didn&apos;t really bond, because we only worked together for a few hours. He seemed chill.
</p><p> 
Pillow Face Bobby
Another Bobby many people don&apos;t know about is &quot;Pillow Face Bobby,&quot; because he was directed to bury his face into the pillow and not turn towards camera. Like with the other Supplemental Bobby Drapers, we didn&apos;t chat too much, but he seemed very nice.
 </p><p> 
Bobby #3
Jared Gilmore ditched for Once Upon A Time, but he was great! He loved Sizzler and eating packets of straight sugar.
 </p><p> 
Bobby #4
Mason Vale Cotton stuck with us through the end. He&apos;s an awesome kid and had the longest run out of all the bros. He loves football and can rock a tux.</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p> 
Now we need an entire oral history from the many Bobby Drapers&#x2014;remember when Bobby #3, Jared Gilmore, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406050837/http://www.tvguide.com/news/kecks-exclusives-new-1036528/">very publicly insinuated</a> January Jones was not a very nice person? &quot;Be careful around January,&quot; he said in an interview, &quot;She&apos;s not as approachable as the others. She&apos;s really serious about what she does. Everyone else is so nice.&quot;
