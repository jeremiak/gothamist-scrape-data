There were so many new ideas Back Then&#x2014;like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010033/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/18/paving_the_hudson.php">paving the Hudson</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010033/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/16/1924_traffic_congestion_solution_dr.php">draining the East River</a>, and bringing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010033/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/08/flashback_moving_sidewalks_where_ar.php">moving sidewalks</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010033/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/20/2level_streets.php">sub streets</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213010033/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/07/1939s_aerotropo.php">an aerotropolis</a> to our urban landscape.
