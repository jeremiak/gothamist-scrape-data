</div></div>					<p>This Upper East Side mansion has 8 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, a garage with exposed brick, one of those ladders that you can step on to reach the books in your very tall library, statement wallpaper, a wine cellar bigger than the restaurant you went to last night, sculptures, chandeliers made from the hardened tears of your former lovers, a floor plan larger than the Mall of America, an elevator, &quot;a handsome rusticated limestone base,&quot; six different floors all providing plenty of space to fill with material goods that will never fill the empty space in your heart, columns, and a few fireplaces in which to burn your secrets.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030043059/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/06/08/glitzy_mansion_with_massive_wine_cellar_returns_for_29m.php">Curbed</a> notes that the owner of the home is David Rozenholc, &quot;a wildly successful tenants&apos; rights lawyer who has, for decades, notched big-name (and big-dollar value) victories over the likes of Donald Trump.&quot;</p>
