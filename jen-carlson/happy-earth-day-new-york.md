<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164847/http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/04/memories_of_the.html">Wired&apos;s science blog</a> tells us that &quot;only two dozen people have seen our planet in its entirety from space&quot; (most have been low orbit views where the entire planet isn&apos;t visible). The AP asked them all to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164847/http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=12621&amp;ref=rss">describe that view</a> for Earth Day.

</p><p>The first full view of Earth was from Apollo 8 in 1968. Astronaut Bill Anders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164847/http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:As08-16-2593.jpg">took the photos</a> during that mission that ended up on posters and pins for the first Earth Day in 1970. Here are some quotes from the AP piece: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;It was the only color we could see in the universe. ... &quot;We&apos;re living on a tiny little dust mote in left field on a rather insignificant galaxy. And basically this it for humans. It strikes me that it&apos;s a shame that we&apos;re squabbling over oil and borders.&quot;
-Bill Anders, Apollo 8, whose photos of Earth became famous.

<p>&quot;You come back impressed, once you&apos;ve been up there, with how thin our little atmosphere is that supports all life here on Earth. So if we foul it up, there&apos;s no coming back from something like that.&quot;<br>
-John Glenn, first American to orbit the Earth (1962) and former U.S. senator.</p>

<p>&quot;...From up there, it looks finite and it looks fragile and it really looks like just a tiny little place on which we live in a vast expanse of space. It gave me the feeling of really wanting us all to take care of the Earth. I got more of a sense of Earth as home, a place where we live. And of course you want to take care of your home. You want it clean. You want it safe.&quot;<br>
-Winston Scott, two-time shuttle astronaut who wrote a book, &quot;Reflections From Earth Orbit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can see what a small little atmosphere is protecting us. You realize there&apos;s not much protecting this planet particularly when you see the view from the side. That&apos;s something I&apos;d like to share with everybody so people would realize we need to protect it.&quot;<br>
-Sunita Williams, who has been living on the international space station since Dec. 11, 2006.</p></blockquote><p></p>
