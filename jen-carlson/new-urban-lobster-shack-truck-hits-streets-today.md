<p>The Urban Lobster Shack, which slings lobster rolls and such from its restaurants in the Financial District and Midtown East, has launched its first food truck onto the streets of New York today. Their <em>lobster red</em> shack on wheels will feature Urban Lobster Shack&apos;s signature fare, including their Famous Lobster Roll (at the suspiciously fair price of $13), hand-cut Old Bay French Fries, and Fried Clam Strip Roll.</p>

<p>To find out where to catch the truck, check on their Twitter account (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529111908/https://twitter.com/#!/urbanlobster">@UrbanLobster</a>)&#x2014;they&apos;ll be updating starting at 11:30 a.m. today. Murmurings on Twitter suggest they&apos;re in Midtown already... which is totally unfair because the Urban Lobster Shack is already housed there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529111908/http://www.orderingonline.com/urbanlobstersha"><em>and</em> delivers</a> between 34th and 65th, from River to 7th. Come to Brooklyn, you guys! Pinchy would have wanted it that way...</p>
