<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190957/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2720&amp;src=dx1">Blender</a> has a list of 100 Days That Changed Music, and not surprisingly a good amount of them took place in New York. Here are a few, see any missing?</p>

<p>99. December 11, 1965: The Velvet Underground play their first show, which was actually at a high school dance in Summit, New Jersey. The following year however, the Velvets became the house band at Warhol&apos;s Factory.</p>

<p>96. December 14, 1977: &quot;Saturday Night Fever debuts in New York prompting the inexorable march of polyester suits and disco into the suburbs &#x2014; and throughout the world.&quot; (note: see #10.)</p>

<p>93. June 30, 1989: &quot;Do the Right Thing hits theaters introducing Public Enemy&#x2019;s righteous rage to the world at large, Spike Lee&#x2019;s breakout film practically doubled as a music video for &apos;Fight the Power,&apos; which is heard no less than 15 times in the movie.&quot; </p>

<p>37. December 23, 2006: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190957/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/24/goodbye_tower_r.php">Tower Records closes up shop</a>.</p>

<p>34. October 11, 1975: Debut of Saturday Night Live. &quot;SNL goes on to introduce mainstream America to such musical sensations as Elvis Costello, Talking Heads and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190957/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/08/timberlake_is_t.php">Dick in a Box</a>.&#x201D; (note: Lazy Sunday was #73)</p>

<p>29. August 18, 1969: Hendrix played &#x201C;The Star&#x2013;Spangled Banner&#x201D; at Woodstock.</p>

December 31, 1942: Frank Sinatra (pictured with Phil Rizzuto) played the Paramount. &quot;Two full decades before Beatlemania, Ol&#x2019; Blue Eyes sends bobby&#x2013;soxers into shrieking hysterics, shutting down Times Square and forcing NYC cops to call in the riot squad.&quot; </p>

<p>22. December 8, 1980: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190957/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/26/yoko_onos_messa.php">John Lennon murdered</a>, the 60s officially die.</p>

<p>12. February 2, 1976: Ramones make a record for $6,000 at Radio City Music Hall&#x2019;s studio. &quot;Each song got one take: guitarist Johnny played in a gym the Rockettes used for dance rehearsal; bassist Dee Dee in the control room; and in another room on drums, Tommy &#x2014; a guitarist who&#x2019;d never sat behind a kit in his life.&quot;</p>

<p>10. April 26, 1977: Studio 54 opens. Two years later, on July 12th, 1979, disco dies. </p>

<p>8. December 21, 1960: Bob Dylan leaves Minnesota and 34 days later arrives in New York and plays his first gig at an open mic night at Cafe Wha?.</p>

<p>5. August 1, 1981: MTV debuts. &quot;In a banner day for lip&#x2013;synching, outrageous fashion and rebellious teens, music hops mediums, making walking, talking 2&#x2013;D video stars accessible 24 hours a day.&quot; (note: Madonna singing &#x201C;Like a Virgin&#x201D; at the VMAs on September 14th, 1984 was #19, and the Real World airing for the first time on May 21st, 1992 was #45.)</p>

<p>2. August 11, 1973: DJ Kool Herc invents hip&#x2013;hop in the rec room of 1520 Sedgwick Ave, an apartment building that is, sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190957/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/21/hip_hop.php">changing with the times</a>. (note: The Sugarhill Gang release &#x201C;Rapper&#x2019;s Delight,&quot; hip hop&apos;s first classic, on September 18, 1979, which came in at #25.)</p>

<p>#1 takes place in New York as well, see what event beat out Justin and Britney breaking up (#13, by the way), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190957/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2724">here</a> (and oddly enough it&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190957/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Music_Died">the day the music died</a>). Some more interesting dates: at #48, on October 23rd, 2001 the iPod was released and at #83 on January 26th, 1995 the first MPEG3 patent filed.</p>
