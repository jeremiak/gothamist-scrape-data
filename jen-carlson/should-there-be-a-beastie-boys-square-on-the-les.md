<p>Even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019140238/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php">Paul&apos;s Boutique</a> was said to be in Brooklyn, the famous shot on the album cover depicting it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019140238/http://nyminute.blog.arte.tv/2009/12/29/in-search-of-pauls-boutique/">was captured</a> at 99 Rivington Street, at the corner of Ludlow on the Lower East Side. And now fans of the band want to name that area &quot;Beastie Boys Square,&quot; an effort LeRoy McCarthy started back in September.  </p>

<p>The Beasties have plenty of downtown history aside from this album cover (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019140238/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/04/beastie_boys_tour.php">our walking tour</a>). From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019140238/https://www.change.org/petitions/beastie-boys-square">McCarthy&apos;s petition site</a>, he explains: &quot;In the panoramic photograph it captured the vibrancy of the ever-changing life on the streets of NYC. The album, released July 25th 1989, was groundbreaking, and it encompassed these Boys from NYC, rapping about life and times from their point of view. Because of the album cover photo, and the Beastie Boys were ever-changing NYC artist, the location of Ludlow Street and Rivington Street would be a great place to honor Beastie Boys with a corner co-naming.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151019140238/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131217/lower-east-side/lower-east-side-corner-could-be-named-beastie-boys-square">DNAInfo</a>, McCarthy hopes to present his proposal to Community Board 3, though the board has not confirmed if it&apos;s on the agenda for January. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve also reached out to Beastie Boys&apos; PR company to get their thoughts on this, and will update if we hear back.</p>
