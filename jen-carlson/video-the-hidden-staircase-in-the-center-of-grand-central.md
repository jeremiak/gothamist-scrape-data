<p>During our recent exploration of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006065513/http://gothamist.com/tags/grandcentral">Grand Central</a>, we learned about the Terminal&apos;s staircases&#x2014;the two on either side of the main concourse, and the one that&apos;s hidden from the public eye, right in the center of that same floor. We&apos;ll start with that one. </p>

<p>The MTA&apos;s Dan Brucker told us that the information booth, which gets around a thousand questions an hour, has a &quot;brass cylindrical center... roll back one of those doors, and there&#x2019;s a secret steel spiral circular staircase leading to the lower level information booth. So the information booth people can climb up, climb down, climb up, climb down, as they&#x2019;re serving customers arriving or departing on different trains at different times all throughout the day.&quot; Here&apos;s a look inside:</p>

<p>While it looks pretty dingy below, the information booth is famously topped with an extremely valuable clock. The four-faced timepiece, crafted in 1913, &quot;has an often-quoted value in the tens of millions of dollars due to its history, artistry, fame, and jeweled faces,&quot; which are all opalescent glass.</p>

<p>Look east or west and you&apos;ll see two other staircases, both out in the open. They have a secret, too&#x2014;Brucker told us that when the terminal was built, there was only one staircase, which was modeled after the one in the Paris opera house. It wasn&apos;t until the 1990s that a duplicate staircase was made... well, almost duplicate. Brucker says, &quot;The old staircase is one inch smaller from the [newer] staircase, so that hundreds of thousands of years from now archaeologists discover this place, they&#x2019;ll know, they were not put in at the same time.&quot; </p>

<p>The new one is on the east side, and since original blueprints called for two staircases, the plans got through the Landmarks Preservation Commission. From a 1994 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006065513/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/29/nyregion/grand-central-may-be-getting-east-staircase.html">the NY Times</a> article regarding the second staircase, which was only just being proposed (it wasn&apos;t complete until 1998):</p><blockquote>Philip Johnson, the architect, a leader in the fight to preserve Grand Central in the 1970&apos;s, said yesterday: &quot;It&apos;s a logical way to complete the Beaux-Arts approach to architecture, which was symmetry. And it brings back the balcony level into some sort of usefulness.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The plan is &quot;responsible and imaginative,&quot; said Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. &quot; &apos;Excelsior!&apos; is our general reaction,&quot; he added.</p></blockquote>Though there was some concern about changing Grand Central, the article noted that the MAS had actually yet &quot;to take a position on the staircase and is concerned that the balconies not become a private preserve of restaurant patrons. &apos;You shouldn&apos;t have to book a table to get a view,&apos; Mr. Barwick said. &apos;There still ought to be a place&#x2014;not to romance this too much&#x2014;where a lonely sailor can go and look down.&apos;&quot; Well, anyone can enjoy the Apple store.<p></p>
