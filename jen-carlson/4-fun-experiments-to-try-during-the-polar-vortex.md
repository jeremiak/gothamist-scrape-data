title: 4 Fun Experiments To Try During The Polar Vortex
---

	
										<p>It&apos;s not every day we experience a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406155236/http://gothamist.com/tags/polarvortex">Polar Vortex</a>, or temperatures that drop this low, so while we&apos;re in the thick of it we might as well try to have fun. Here are some cool experiments you can try out in the cold weather... it&apos;s like the winter version of frying an egg on the sidewalk. </p>

<p><strong>FROZEN BUBBLES</strong><br>

<p>Photographer Angela Kelly, who lives in Washington State, tested out what would happen if you were to blow bubbles in cold weather. She told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406155236/http://www.weather.com/sports-rec/below-zero/stunning-shots-frozen-soap-bubbles-20140106">Weather.com</a>, &quot;This whimsical series happened entirely on that, a whim. I had often wondered if it were possible for bubbles to freeze and upon hearing that we were due for an arctic blast [I] decided that it would be a perfect time to test out my theory. We found that certain surfaces worked better than others. The hood of my SUV and our patio table served as the perfect stage and viewing point to the amazing show. We watched in fascination and awe as each of the bubbles froze, taking on their own patterns and characteristics; each one different from the next.&#x201D; Just like a snowflake. You can check out more of her gorgeous images <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406155236/http://www.flickr.com/photos/grnidmonstress/">here</a>. We tried this and it&apos;s a little hard to keep the bubbles from bursting before they freeze, but when they burst they froze quickly: </p>

<p><strong>TURN WATER IN TO SNOW</strong><br>

<p>[<strong>UPDATE:</strong> You could get burned trying this, and our weather expert tells us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406155236/http://www.livescience.com/32951-how-can-boiling-water-turn-snow.html">this</a> really only works well if it&apos;s below 0 degrees. So instead it&apos;s probably best to just watch the videos from our midwest friends, who had -15 degree weather yesterday when they were trying this out.] </p>

<p>Over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406155236/http://chicagoist.com/2014/01/07/our_favorite_chiberia_snow_day_vide.php">at Chicagoist</a> they&apos;ve got a roundup of people doing just that in their city yesterday, which includes the stellar, slow motion video above. This is simple to do: when hot water and cold air meet, the water vaporizes and you&apos;ll get some version of snow or ice. (And please, hold your camera horizontally when capturing this miracle digitally.)</p>

<p><strong>MAKE MAPLE SYRUP TAFFY</strong><br>

<p><em>Also</em> at Chicagoist (they are the cold weather experts after all), they&apos;re making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406155236/http://chicagoist.com/2014/01/07/make_maple_syrup_taffy_lollipops_ou.php">Maple Syrup Taffy</a>! All you have to do is &quot;take some maple syrup, warm it on the stove, then find a clean patch of snow in your backyard and drizzle the syrup atop it. The syrup quickly freezes in the snow to form a near-taffy like constitution. You can pull it directly from the snow and eat it where you stand or you can take wooden kabob skewers and roll the syrup taffy around one end to make maple syrup taffy lollipops.&quot; If you don&apos;t have any snow left where you are, we&apos;re betting you can do this on a cold cookie sheet... right? Science!</p>

<p><strong>FREEZE AN EGG</strong><br>

<p>Or whatever you want! The temperatures are below freezing, so things are gonna freeze. An it helps if those things are wet&#x2014;as seen in the above video, news crews everywhere are having fun with frozen wet t-shirt contests.</p>
