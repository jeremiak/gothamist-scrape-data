<p>Beavis and Butt-Head are back, and below is a peek at what their first episode in about 14 years will look like. When creator Mike Judge was asked at Comic-Con why he&apos;s reviving the show, he said, &#x201C;I felt like TV was getting too smart.&quot; The show will return in October, and the duo will even take on the <em>Jersey Shore</em> cast (Judge said he &quot;didn&apos;t feel good after watching [Jersey Shore], but I kept watching it.&quot;).    <br>

<p>If you want some old school Beavis and Butt-Head, VH1 Classic will be airing some episodes on July 30th for MTV&apos;s 30th birthday. For three days the network will run &quot;memorable musical performances, hit series, specials, promos and news events that shaped the history of the network.&quot; This includes shows like Remote Control, YO! MTV Raps, The Real World, Club MTV, and more. Now, can we bring back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307173827/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/instant_entertainment.php?gallery0Pic=3">Daria</a>?</p>
