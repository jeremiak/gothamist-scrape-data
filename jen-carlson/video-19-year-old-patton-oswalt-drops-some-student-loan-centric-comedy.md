---

	
										<p>The below video shows a 19-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160416/http://gothamist.com/tags/pattonoswalt">Patton Oswalt</a>... and it&apos;s kind of best viewed without knowing <em>anything about it</em> so you&apos;re just transported to a comedy club that&apos;s inexplicably centered around student loan jokes.</p>

<p>This weekend Patton Oswalt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160416/https://twitter.com/pattonoswalt/status/355810169243971585">Tweeted</a> the video, explaining: &quot;First paid acting gig. 19 years old. $300. Educational video about student loans. Sweater vest. Kill me.&quot; Well, that buzzkill Allister McAllister was a tough act to follow, telling the audience of young kids who <em>just wanted to forget about their debt until they graduated at least</em>: &quot;Keep in mind you&apos;re borrowing that money, so you&apos;ve got to pay it back, whether you finish school or not, and whether you find a job in your field of training or not. You get the idea? You study hard and then you pay.&quot;</p>
