<p>It didn&apos;t take long for the High Line lawn to become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110622075753/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/after_dark_the_high_lines_phase_ii.php#photo-1">this generation&apos;s Plato&apos;s Retreat</a>, with plenty of young New Yorkers flocking there for some action. Most recently we were even sent photos of one couple looking very happy after getting to second base in broad daylight (see below). And now, the High Line lawn has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110622075753/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2011/06/everyday-chatter_20.html">closed for &quot;restoration&quot;</a>&#x2014;which means the rain didn&apos;t wash away all the sins last week, and this grass is getting sanitized! Or maybe it just got all muddy from the rain. <em>Who can say!</em> Either way though, it wouldn&apos;t hurt to give it a nice Purell bath.</p>
