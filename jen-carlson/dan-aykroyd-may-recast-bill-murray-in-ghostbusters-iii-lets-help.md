<p>For years, YEARS, we&apos;ve been hearing about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040748/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters3"><em>Ghostbusters III</em></a>. It&apos;s hard to keep up with all of the rumors and mumblings, so to recap: it may or may not involve the Apatow bros, or the original cast, or Anna Farris, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040748/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/dan-aykroyd-says-he-might-recast-peter-venkman-for-ghostbusters-3-denies-rumor-that-bill-murray-trashed-his-script">or John Hodgman</a>? (That last one is new to us.) But the latest to come from one of the only legit people involved, Dan Aykroyd, is that Bill Murray will definitely not be returning (which we sort of knew when he said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040748/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/bill_murray_allegedly_shredded_the.php">shredded the script</a>). <em>However</em>, his character Peter Venkman may be. That&apos;s right, Aykroyd hinted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040748/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=33126">in a recent interview</a> that &quot;Bill Murray may not return as Peter Venkman, and that the character could be played by a different actor.&quot; Which is a terrible idea! But even so, who would you cast? Our office is split between an older Venkmen, and a more youthful one, and you can see our picks above (sorry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040748/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/what_does_this_photo_of_jonah_hill.php">Jonah Hill</a>, you didn&apos;t make the cut.) More importantly, should this movie even happen?</p>
