</div></div>					<p>City views, serene parks, a gondola that will whisk you away to Manhattan, a view of the beautiful 59th Street Bridge... why aren&apos;t we all living on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609072639/http://gothamist.com/tags/rooseveltisland">Roosevelt Island</a>? </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609072639/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/05/29/roosevelt_islands_newest_coops_ask_from_just_392900.php">Curbed</a>, Island House (a former Mitchell Lama building turned co-op) has now put six units on the market&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609072639/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3462029">this studio</a> is bigger than your one-bedroom and it only costs $392,000! That&apos;s a great deal for anyone who has managed to save money and isn&apos;t still paying off student loans. You can&apos;t rent a storage unit for that in Williamsburg! Prices go all the way up to $1 million in the building, located at 575 Main Street, and more will be on the market soon. </p>

<p>Have you been to Main Street, by the way? It looks like a creepy Stepford street, with uniformed storefronts that have very literal signs. &quot;Child school,&quot; &quot;Flower shop,&quot; etc. </p>

<p>But check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609072639/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/NewDevelopments/Display/627">that wide oak-plank flooring</a>! And did we mention the pool?
