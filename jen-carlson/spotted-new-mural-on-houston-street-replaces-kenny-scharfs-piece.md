<p>We are now several layers away from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231906/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/26/rip_shepard_fairey_mural_2010-2010.php">the Shepard Fairey mural</a> that took over the Houston Street wall last year. Most recently it was adorned by the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231906/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/30/overacheiving_street_artists_finish.php">Kenny Scharf</a>, and as of today it&apos;s been taken over by street artist JR. Here&apos;s a shot of his wheatpasted piece&#x2014;it sort of reminds us of Dr. Eckleburg&apos;s eyes, so watch out East Village sinners, you are under watch.
