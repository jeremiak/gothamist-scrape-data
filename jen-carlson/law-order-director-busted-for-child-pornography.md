<p>A director for <em>Law &amp; Order</em> was arrested for child pornography yesterday.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121090326/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003167/">Jason &quot;Jace&quot; Alexander</a>, 51, a Dobbs Ferry resident, was charged with two felony counts&#x2014;&quot;one count of promoting a sexual performance by a child and one count of possessing an obscene sexual performance by a child,&quot; which could get him up to seven years in prison if convicted.</p>

<p>According to the Westchester DA&apos;s office, on July 24th they &quot;downloaded child pornography from an IP address in Westchester County.&quot; This led to an &quot;investigation and pursuant to a subpoena,&quot; and it was determined that the IP address was assigned to Alexander&apos;s home. After a search warrant was performed there, a &quot;forensic examination of computers and external hard drives removed from the location revealed digital files of children who are less than sixteen years of age engaged in child pornography.&quot;</p>
