<blockquote>Biophilia premiered this past summer at the Manchester International Festival (MIF) in England to great acclaim including The New York Times featuring the performance in their &quot;Concert Highs of 2011&quot;, followed by a sold out residency in Bjork&apos;s hometown of Reykjavik, Iceland. Initially commissioned by MIF, the intimate performance finds Bj&#xF6;rk accompanied by a set of unique musical instruments created by a team including an Icelandic organ builder and a graduate of the MIT Media Lab. Among these creations are four 10-foot pendulum-harps, a midi-controlled pipe organ celeste re-fitted with bronze gamelan bars, and twin musical tesla coils. The performance also features an award-winning 24-piece Icelandic female choir and visuals from the Biophilia Apps with app developer Max Weisel performing on stage alongside Bj&#xF6;rk and musicians Manu Delagu and Zeena Parkins.</blockquote> 

<p>You know, typical Bj&#xF6;rk show. Tickets go on sale January 13th at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster. But there&apos;s more! The performer will collaborate with the New York Hall of Science on a three-week-long Biophilia education series, which will feature &quot;interactive science and music workshops for middle-school children, the series leads students on an intensive study of the scientific concepts at the core of Biophilia&apos;s songs, including crystalline structures, lunar phases, viruses and more. Students will also learn to use the Biophilia apps as tools for music composition.&quot; The program has actually been incorporated into the Icelandic school syllabus.</p>
