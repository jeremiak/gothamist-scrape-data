										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smlargebiltmore0912.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030453im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smlargebiltmore0912.jpeg" width="350" height="232" class="image-right"> </span>Grand Central Terminal can be a highly romantic place, so it&apos;s not surprising there was once a designated &quot;Kissing Room&quot;&#x2014;and the good news is that room is coming back. That&apos;s right, romance isn&apos;t dead, it was just held hostage by the MTA for a little bit. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030453/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444358804578018833529575630.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">the Wall Street Journal</a>, the space is below where the Biltmore Hotel used to be housed, and currently contains a newsstand, flower stand, and shoe shine booths. But in the glory days of train travel, the spot (also called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030453/http://gonyc.about.com/od/photogalleries/ss/grand_central_5.htm">The Biltmore Room</a>) was &quot;where arriving travelers once embraced their sweethearts.&quot; Politicians and celebrities would even greet each other there before retreating to the famous Biltmore Hotel, where Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald honeymooned (J.D. Salinger also included it in <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>). </p>

<p>Now that little corner will be renovated into an arrival area once again, specifically for riders using the new East Side Access terminal. The Journal reports that &quot;the newsstand will be ripped out and replaced by a pair of escalators and an elevator that will return the Kissing Room to its status as a busy meeting place for travelers arriving in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>The $15.5 million renovation won&apos;t really be underway until 2019, but feel free to call it The Kissing Room again starting NOW. Move over whisper wall!</p>
