<p>Long before green beer was poured and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210648/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/livestream_watch_the_st_patricks_da.php">livestreaming the action</a> on your laptop was a possibility, the St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade took over the Manhattan streets in a much more... civil way. The first parade happened on March 17th, 1762, and has been held for the past 248 years in honor of the Patron Saint of Ireland and the Archdiocese of New York. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210648/http://nyc-st-patrick-day-parade.org/paradehistory.aspx">According to lore</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Parade is reviewed from the steps of Saint Patrick&apos;s Cathedral by His Eminence Cardinal Edward Eagan, Archbishop of New York in the same manner as the Archbishop of New York did in the early days of the Parade at the Old St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral in Lower Manhattan when the Parade was held in Lower Manhattan before the new St Patrick&#x2019;s was built on Fifth Avenue.</blockquote>

<p>Looks a little different these days, no?</p>
