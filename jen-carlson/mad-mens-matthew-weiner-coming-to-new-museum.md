<p>The New Museum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170329/http://www.newmuseum.org/calendar/view/visionaries-series-matthew-weiner">has announced</a> that Matthew Weiner will be the 2013 Stuart Regen Visionary. What does that mean for everyone? </p>

<p>For you, it means that you&apos;ll have a chance to see him speak, with Author A.M. Homes, on September 27th. </p>

<p>For Weiner, it means that he&apos;ll be honored as a leading international thinker in contemporary culture. This is part of the museum&apos;s Visionaries Series, and in the past Alice Waters, Bill T. Jones, and Jimmy Wales have all been honored. Curator at Large, Richard Flood, <em>really</em> hyped the show in his statement, saying:</p><blockquote>&quot;<em>Mad Men</em> cuts like a razor, but its humanitarian impulses lift the show above the never-ending, brutal cycles of competition. Matthew Weiner has created something that has raised television&#x2019;s standard for quality and invention. <em>Mad Men</em> is a true, visionary accomplishment, one that transcends genre and suggests a new, expanded definition of telenovela because &#x2018;series&#x2019; just isn&#x2019;t adequate.&#x201D;</blockquote>The museum also believes that &quot;the show has the extraordinary ability to vividly recreate that decade&quot; of the 1960s, and you can revisit all of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170329/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmenhistory">historical references right here</a>.<p></p>

<p>The show will likely return for its final season early next year, though no premiere date has been set yet&#x2014;Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170329/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/mad-men-season-7_n_3490348.html">recently said</a>, &quot;I&apos;m in denial about the show ending.&quot;</p>

<p>Tickets for the talk will go on sale to members first ($20), now through September 1st, and then to the general public ($25).</p>
