										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="birdemic0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316141938im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/birdemic0110.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="image-left"> </span>As you have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316141938/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/kfsm-mysterious-death-of-birds-fish-01032011,0,3701037.story">definitely heard</a> by now, 100,000 dead fish went belly up last week on a 20 mile stretch along the Arkansas River, and then on New Year&apos;s Eve&#x2014;just before the witching hour&#x2014;thousands of red-winged blackbirds fell dead from the sky (also in Arkansas). But Arkansas is <em>so far away</em> and we live in New York City and we&apos;re all going to live forever and nothing can touch us. Well this thing is moving, people, and yesterday an estimated 500 red-winged blackbirds fell from the sky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316141938/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/112843019.html">in Louisiana</a>. Necropsies show that the birds suffered internal injuries that formed blood clots, which led to their deaths. As Louisiana local Denise Dickerson proclaimed: &quot;This is really getting kind of crazy with the fish and the birds and these tornadoes hitting during the winter.&quot;</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316141938/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/us/04beebe.html?_r=2&amp;src=tptw">the Gray Lady</a> gave the story some ink yesterday, are New Yorkers even flinching at the news? Let&apos;s not wait until 100,000 pigeons fall dead on some precious Williamsburg rooftop garden&#x2014;it&apos;s time to build a bubble over the city, because the last thing we want is the End of Days ruining our urban beekeeping (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316141938/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/19/elizabeth_kolbert.php">bees themselves</a> are already ruining that!). One Arkansas woman who was standing outside with the smoking crowd at a NYE party told the Times about her harrowing experience, saying, &#x201C;One of [the birds] almost hit my best friend in the head. <strong>We went inside after that.&#x201D;</strong> </p>
