<p>It&apos;s snowing, again, and the sky is a specific shade of white/gray... kind of like the color of skywriting. Which makes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231926/http://gothamist.com/tags/uber">Uber</a>&apos;s Valentine&apos;s Day offering of personalized skywriting even more ridiculous. The car service company&#x2014;which has taken to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231926/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/27/uber_personal_halftime_shows_coming.php">offering the absurd</a> lately&#x2014;has just announced that it&apos;ll be bringing &quot;ON-DEMAND SKYWRITING!&quot; to New Yorkers for one day only (February 14th).</p>

<p>In their announcement they explain that you&apos;ll be able to send the &quot;turbocharged love letter right from the Uber app&quot; for $500 (presumably no winter weather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231926/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/19/new_york_city_uber_price_surge.php">surge pricing</a> for this one). The offer will be available on the app from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (when the sun has already set) tomorrow through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231926/http://blog.uber.com/UberSKY">UberSKY</a> option&#x2014;you&apos;ll &quot;confirm the $500 price tag and wait for an Uber rep to call.&quot; You&apos;ll tell the rep your 12-character message, and they&apos;ll tell you when you can expect to see it in the sky. They declare this is the &quot;ultimate grand gesture.&quot; Grander than naming a star after someone, even.</p>

<p>Anyway, don&apos;t they know Shia LaBeouf already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508231926/http://laist.com/2014/01/10/shia_labeouf_skywrites_hashtag.php">ruined skywriting</a>?</p>
