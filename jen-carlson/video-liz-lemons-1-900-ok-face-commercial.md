title: Video: Liz Lemon's 1-900-OK-FACE Commercial
---

	
										<p>On last week&apos;s <em>30 Rock</em> we learned a little bit about Liz Lemon&apos;s past life where she pursued acting and starred in (at least one) phone sex commercial that aired in the &quot;Greater Chicagoland&quot; area. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011401/http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/clips/1-900-okface/1076106/">NBC</a> has finally offered up the full commercial online&#x2014;if you had 70 cents for the first minute and 6 cents each additional minute, would you call 1-900-OK-FACE?</p>
