<p>Williamsburg Waterfront, you are growing up so fast! The area, drowned in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714150658/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/13/condo_no_developers_big_williamsbur.php">luxury condos</a>, will soon have its first chain store grand opening! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714150658/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2009/09/streetlevel_ken.php">Brownstoner</a> recently spotted the shiny, new Duane Reade, &quot;one of the three businesses signed up for retail space at Northside Piers on Kent Avenue, set to open on Saturday. Word of the ubiquitous drugstore chain&apos;s arrival on the Brooklyn waterfront first broke over a year ago; signage confirmed the news back in June.&quot; Their first space in the neighborhood is located at North 5th and Kent, a grueling 15 blocks from the closest Chase Bank. Meanwhile, just four blocks away is the current establishment hipsters get their Adderall refilled at, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714150658/http://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-pharmacy-brooklyn-2">King&apos;s Pharmacy</a>. Will their customers remain loyal?</p>
