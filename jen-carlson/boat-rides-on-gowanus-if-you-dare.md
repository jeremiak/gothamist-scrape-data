</div></div>					<p>Time to test your own waters to see if you&apos;re brave enough to take a boat ride in the Gowanus Canal (home to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141606/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">gonohorrea bacteria</a> and other little treats).</p>

<p>Tomorrow the Gowanus Studio Space embarks on their own journey to a new 7,000 square-foot space they plan to renovate, and since that kind of work doesn&apos;t come cheap, they&apos;ll need your help. The fundraising event (titled UMWELTEN, after the German semiotic term loosely meaning &quot;perceived worlds&quot;), will include enticingly risky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141606/http://thefreeseas.org/?p=294">boat rides</a> on the canal! </p>

<p>So fascinated with the idea of colorful, handmade vessels floating atop the canal&apos;s questionable water as the sun sets, we asked for photos&#x2014;and you know, it looks rather pretty. The full itinerary for the fundraiser is after the jump (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141606/http://www.gowanusstudio.org/upcoming.php">more details here</a>), and please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141606/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us photos</a> if you take a ride on the boats!</p>
