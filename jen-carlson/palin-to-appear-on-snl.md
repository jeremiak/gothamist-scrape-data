Job security for SNL characters.&quot; But whereas the audience laughs <em>with</em> Feylin, it&apos;s very likely they will be laughing <em>at</em> Palin. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055509/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/zwecker/1203739,CST-FTR-fey05.article">Chicago Sun Times</a> reports that the McCain campaign is pondering how to respond to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055509/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/28/snl_4.php">recent SNL skits</a>, adding that Palin wants an on-air response and &quot;may be working on a spoof of Fey&apos;s American Express commercials.&quot; Ha? The next live SNL episode airs on October 18th, but Thursday NBC will air their first &apos;&apos;Weekend Update&apos;&apos; special <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055509/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2008/10/06/Lifestyle/weekend.Update.Comes.To.Prime.Time-3470749.shtml">in prime time</a>. In the meantime, The Edge suggests Palin move in to their new condo complex so she can keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055509/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/40/31_40_bm_palin_mockery.html">a watchful eye on Wall Street</a>.</p>
