We trust you&apos;ve all seen the video of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://ethanchandler.com/">Ethan Chandler</a> singing a Bank of America-fied version of U2&apos;s &quot;One&quot;. If not, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qAuqq1LFnU">please watch now</a>. It&apos;s straight out of <em>The Office</em>. 

</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://www.stereogum.com/archives/003993.html">Stereogum reports</a> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://angrycitizen.typepad.com/angry_citizen/2006/11/johnny_marr_dav.html">Angry Citizen</a>) that this weekend David Cross and Johnny Marr opened the Modest Mouse show at Bowery Ballroom...with Ethan&apos;s version of &quot;One&quot;. Cross is even all decked out in the appropriate attire. Luckily this was caught on tape (watch above), <em>this</em> is why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232410/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15592918/">YouTube won &quot;Invention of the Year&quot;</a>, and not some silly disease preventing vaccine.</p>
