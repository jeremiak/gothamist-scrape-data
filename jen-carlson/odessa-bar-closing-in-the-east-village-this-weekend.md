<p>Odessa, the East Village bar next to the restaurant of the same name, is closing after 33 years. Forever. The end. Last call. Closing time. Say goodbye to your youth. The East Village is dead. RIP old New York. The rent is too damn high. ETC. </p>

<p>To be clear, and as illustrated in the above image, the restaurant&#x2014;where you soak up the night&apos;s alcohol with grilled cheese and fried eggplant&#x2014;will remain open. But Odessa&apos;s bar next door, where you procure that alcohol that led you to the grilled cheese, is closing. And it&apos;s all happening this weekend. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095743/http://evgrieve.com/2013/08/weekend-recap-odessa-cafe-and-bar.html">EV Grieve</a> spotted their goodbye letter this week: </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095743/http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/08/odessa-closing-avenue-a.html">Grub Street</a> a &quot;new American brasserie/bistro&quot; may take over the space. As for Odessa, they will pour their last drop on Saturday, August 31st. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095743/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/21/ev_favorite_odessas_building_for_sa.php">you knew this was coming</a>.</p>
