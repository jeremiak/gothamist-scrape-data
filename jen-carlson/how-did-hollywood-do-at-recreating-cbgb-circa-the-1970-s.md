<p>Last month we learned that CBGB circa the 1970s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210425/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/08/cbgb_biopic_will_feature_authentic.php">was being recreated in Georgia</a>, for an upcoming movie about the historic venue. And now, finally, photos from the set in Savannah are starting to emerge. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210425/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2012/07/savannahs-cbgb.html">Jeremiah&apos;s Vanishing NY</a> has a couple of shots, including the one above, and notes that it was &quot;recreated next to Paula Deen&apos;s downtown restaurant&quot; in the neighborhood. Andre Danylevich, CBGB associate producer, says, &quot;We put what is called a plug into the front of the building here. They created a stucco wall, an entrance and an awning and put it on top of an existing storefront to recreate the front of CBGB.&quot;</p>

<p>Below you can see a comparison to a photo of the club as it really looked in 1977. They have the &quot;Neolite&quot; sign there, as it was in the &apos;70s, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210425/http://savannah-historic.wtoc.com/news/news/78326-downtown-savannah-transformed-1970s-bowery-cbgb-movie">WTOC in Savannah</a> reports, &quot;the businesses surrounding the club have been resurrected, including the Palace Hotel.&quot; But what did they <em>get wrong</em> in this Epcot version? For starters, the bricks on the building look all wrong, the sidewalk is too thin, the Bowery is only two cars wide... and why isn&apos;t there a David Byrne listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210425/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1786751/fullcredits#cast">in the IMDB credits</a>?</p>
