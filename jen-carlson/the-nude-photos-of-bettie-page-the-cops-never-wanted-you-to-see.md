<span class="photo_caption">Dick Heinlein/Bettie Page Reveals All<span></span></span></p>

<p>If you Google Image Search &quot;Bettie Page&quot; you&apos;ll see a few nude photos of the classic pin-up gal... so calling these new nudes &quot;rare&quot; would be inaccurate. However, they have never before been seen, thanks to the police. </p>

<p>Fully nude, previously unpublished photos of Page are featured for the first time in a new documentary&#x2014;<em>Bettie Page Reveals All</em>&#x2014;which opens on the 22nd <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175457/http://www.bettiepagemovie.com/">at the Village East</a>. These photos were taken around 1952 by Dick Heinlein, who shot them at a &quot;camera club&quot; shoot in Westchester. Filmmaker Mark Mori explained to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175457/http://pagesix.com/2013/11/13/unpublished-nudes-of-bettie-page-uncovered/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=P6Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">the NY Post</a>, &#x201C;Before nude pictures could be [legally] published, there were these &#x2018;camera clubs&#x2019; in dingy New York offices, where men could go to photograph girls. In some instances, 30 or 40 men would pay to take a field trip organized by the club.&quot; But on this field trip (which was also attended by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175457/http://gothamist.com/tags/weegee">Weegee</a>), the police raided the woods and confiscated the film.</p>

<p>Heinlein managed to trick the coppers&#x2014;who had their guns drawn on the group&#x2014;showing them a &quot;0&quot; counter to make them believe he hadn&apos;t shot any photos yet. Check out the trailer below, in which he discusses the incident a little bit:</p>
