<p>Recently Woody Allen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402131627/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/19/woody_allen_will_act_again_but_cant.php">talked about</a> his absence from the silver screen, saying, &quot;I can&#x2019;t play the love interest anymore, and of course this is tremendously frustrating, because that&#x2019;s really what I want to play. But that&#x2019;s not as believable anymore.&quot; But his films, even when he&apos;s just behind the camera, have always had that trademark Woody Allen character, the complete neurotic package, and now someone has gone and made a supercut of them all. From Kenneth Branagh to Rebecca Hall (the only female &quot;Woody Allen Surrogate&#x201D;):</p>

<p>The real deal will be back in next year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402131627/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1859650/">Bop Decameron</a>, when Allen will step back in front of the camera.
