<p>What&apos;s more adorable than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/03/video_james_franco.php">James Franco and a baby chimp</a>? On Sunday the actor (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfrancoclonearmy">or whatever</a>) was at the Toronto International Film Festival when he spotted 13-year-old Macy Armstrong&apos;s homecrafted fan art, clutched tightly in her hands. Franco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/09/james_franco_fan_art.html">reportedly</a> interrupted the proceedings to talk to his fan (who runs the Tumblr <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://jamesfrancoforever.tumblr.com/post/10091843817/ohmygod-i-dont-know-what-just-happened-but-i">James Franco Forever</a>), and ended up buying her pieces.</p>

<p>The lot included a portrait of Franco made out of yarn, a newspaper collage made from clippings about the actor, and a canvas inspired by <em>127 Hours</em>. He told Armstrong, who was wearing a t-shirt with his face on it, &quot;I saw that one on the Internet, someone sent it to me. I wanna buy those.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20110911/james-franco-a-fan-of-fan-art-110911/20110911?s_name=tiff2011">CTV</a>, Armstrong was giddy after the encounter, saying, &quot;Of course, I would love him to have them. I&apos;m a humongous fan. For his birthday, I made him a cake.&quot; Later she took to her Tumblr to relay the story, writing: &quot;He looked at me, he spoke to me, and I&apos;m pretty sure we mentally got married!&quot; (You can read her whole story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://jamesfrancoforever.tumblr.com/post/10101588408/the-most-wonderful-moment-of-my-life">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Armstrong walked away empty handed otherwise, but maybe Franco gave her a piece of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/this_week_in_kickstarters_silent_ba.php">invisible art</a> and we just couldn&apos;t see it? Either way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011402/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/video_ryan_gosling_is_embarrassed_a.php">Ryan Gosling</a>, your move man...</p>
