<p><img alt="200712virginmega.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811134907im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200712virginmega.jpg" width="250" height="200" class="left">Word on the street is that Union Square&apos;s mammoth Virgin Megastore is closing up shop sometime between now and February 2009. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811134907/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i074b6c9d80a4405034066b217129157e">Billboard</a> reports the space is &quot;being offered by a real estate broker for 2009 availability. According to retail sources, New York-based Winick Realty is shopping the space and has sent out packages highlighting its features.&quot;</p>

<p>The 58,000 square-foot space is being offered together or subdivided and may become another retail space or (wait for it) luxury condos! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811134907/http://www.nysun.com/article/68431?page_no=3">NY Sun</a> has more info on the high rent potential. Currently Virgin pays around $100 per square foot, but future &quot;retailers are expected to pay as much as $750 to $1,000 a square foot.&quot;</p>

<p>There is no word yet on if Virgin will open a new Megastore somewhere else in town, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811134907/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08182007/business/realty_bigs_buy_virgin_megastores_business_braden_keil.htm">NY Post</a> recently reported that the Times Square location may also be in trouble, saying, &quot;Industry watchers say the sale would allow Related and Vornado - which are already Virgin&apos;s landlords at their Union Square and Times Square stores, respectively - to close the two stores where Virgin has long-term leases well below market rates.&quot; Looks like billionaire Branson&apos;s retail outlet isn&apos;t faring so well <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811134907/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117978100.html?categoryId=16&amp;cs=1">on the West Coast</a> either. </p>
