The series will take place in a New York City hospital in 1900, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012521/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/steven-soderbergh-will-direct-new-cinemax-series-the-knick/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">ArtsBeat</a> they even plan to film here&#x2014;&quot;production of the series is expected to begin in New York in September.&quot; <p></p>

<p>According to the IMDB page, the show will take a look &quot;at the professional and personal lives of the staff at New York&apos;s Knickerbocker Hospital during the early part of the twentieth century.&quot; So basically <em>Grey&apos;s Anatomy</em> but set in the olden days and starring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012521/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2937900/">dreamy Clive Owen</a>. And FYI: the Knickerbocker Hospital was real, founded in 1862 and located <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012521/http://members.tripod.com/greenwald_j/index-43.html">at 70 Convent Avenue</a> (the address now houses apartments).</p>

<p>Soderbergh recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012521/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/04/30/steven-soderbergh-hollywood-video/">vowed to retire</a>, but maybe got re-energized from his Emmy nom for the HBO miniseries <em>Behind the Candelabra</em>. </p>

<p><em>The Knick</em> will hit Cinemax sometime next year.</p>
