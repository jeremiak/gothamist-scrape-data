<p>Every year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040100/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/ramp_watch.php">around this time</a> we start to wonder: when are we to be reunited with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040100/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">the majestic ramp</a>? The seasonal early spring vegetable can be found everywhere once it&apos;s ready for foraging&#x2014;from Roberta&apos;s pizza to your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040100/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/cooking_with_ramps_pasta_cornbread.php">hand-crafted cocktail</a>. But for us, it&apos;s all about replacing the snacks on Gothamist&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040100/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/is_your_office_filled_with_unhealth.php">Silver Table of Sin</a> with an unending supply of garlic-scented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040100/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/ramp_watch.php">ramp pesto</a>. We asked whoever runs the NYC Greenmarket Twitter yesterday when we could expect to see these around, and we were heartbreakingly told: not for &quot;a couple more weeks at least.&quot; As the sages once whispered, true love is worth waiting for.</p>

<p>If you simply can&apos;t wait, Gramercy Tavern is already serving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040100/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/16/ramps_alert_gramercy_taverns_alread.php">ramp dressing</a>, though it&apos;s unclear what sort of darks arts were brought in to procure these virgin ramps ahead of season.</p>
