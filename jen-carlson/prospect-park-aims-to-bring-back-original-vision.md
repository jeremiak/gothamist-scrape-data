</div></div>					<p>Yesterday morning officials broke ground on the $70-million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020629/http://www.prospectpark.org/lakeside">Lakeside Center</a> in Prospect Park&#x2014;an ambitious initiative that aims to transform 26 acres in the park&apos;s southeast quadrant. According to park officials, this means &quot;the winter-only ice rink will be relocated and replaced with a year-round destination for recreation.&quot; On top of that, the project will restore the surrounding natural environment.</p>

<p>Back to that skating rink. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020629/http://brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=31&amp;id=40175">Brooklyn Eagle</a>, Lakeside will replace the seasonal Wollman Rink with a LEED-certified green building and <em>two</em> outdoor skating rinks&#x2014;ice in the winter, and roller in the warmer months!</p>

<p>All changes aim to keep the original vision of park designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, a vision they say was obscured when Robert Moses built the Wollman Rink in 1960. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020629/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/51/dtg_lakesidecenter_2010_12_24_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the funds aren&apos;t all there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314020629/http://www.prospectpark.org/about/lakeside/lakeside-public-funding">yet</a>, but Mayor Bloomberg has put his support (and money) behind the project, &quot;touting the plan as the best thing to happen to Prospect Park since the paddleboats.&quot;</p>
