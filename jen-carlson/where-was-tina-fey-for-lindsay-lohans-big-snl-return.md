<p>Fey is responsible for one of Lohan&apos;s few triumphs in the acting world, 2004&apos;s <em>Mean Girls</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173854/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/tina-fey-rejects-lindsay-lohan-invitation-host-nl-article-1.1033654?localLinksEnabled=false">the Daily News</a> is reporting that Fey&apos;s &quot;absence sparked murmurs that, after years of defending Lohan, she&#x2019;d finally washed her hands of the actress, who&#x2019;s desperate to make a comeback after years of bad behavior.&quot;</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173854/http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/03/kate-middleton-speaks-tina-fey-bails-lindsay-lohan/49526/">some say</a> she turned down a personal invitation to the show, her spokeswoman says Fey was &quot;committed to doing the monologue with Lindsay,&quot; but had to bail when &quot;both of her children got sick.&quot;</p>
