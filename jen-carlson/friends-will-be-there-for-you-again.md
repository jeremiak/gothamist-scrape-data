Sources say that within the next 18 months Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer will return to their sitcom roles; allegedly Aniston had been the apprehensive one of the bunch, until now.</p><blockquote>The box office success of <em>Sex And The City</em> has really got their wheels spinning about how a Friends film could be just as big, if done right. Timing and the script are really important, but now that Courteney and Jen both have production companies, they can potentially get very involved in those decisions.</blockquote>Warner Bros. is set to produce, and Aniston is set to become the next SJP. A source noted that &quot;As the biggest star of the Friends franchise, Jennifer can&apos;t help but look at what&apos;s happened with Sarah Jessica Parker and the Sex And The City film and be a little jealous.&quot; All that&apos;s left is the business of keeping the cast happy financially, which is often easier said than done -- especially when dealing with not one, but six egos.<p></p>

<p>As for where the movie will pick up, likely where it left off. The last line in the show, which ran for ten years, was an exchange between Rachel and Chandler; she asks: &quot;Shall we go get some coffee?&quot; to which Chandler sarcastically responds, &quot;Sure. Where?&quot; If the movie is set in real time, however, the gang&apos;s local caffeine purveyor Central Perk would now be a Starbucks.</p>

<p>Hopefully this new trend of long gone shows being resurrected on the big screen can only mean that a <em>Seinfeld</em> movie is inevitable. </p>
