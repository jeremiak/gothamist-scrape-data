<p>We have talked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063307/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/door_holding_etiquette.php">door holding etiquette</a> before, because let&apos;s be honest... it&apos;s weird when someone holds the door open for you when you&apos;re too far away. Maybe you aren&apos;t even going in to that door, or maybe you want to go at your own pace and not get your heart rate up, or maybe it&apos;s none of anyone&apos;s business and they just shouldn&apos;t be holding the door open at awkward distances! This practice in misguided chivalry is still happening out there, however, so it&apos;s time for a refresher course. Enter: these dudes from Utah (yes, we will import our etiquette teachings from Utah if need be).</p>
