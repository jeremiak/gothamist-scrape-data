<p>We love Neighborhoodies. We don&apos;t have one, because we can never think of anything we&apos;d want it to say, but we do love them so. You know who else loves them?</p>

Taylor Hicks!

</p><p>The Neighborhoodies crew caught a clip of the American Idol sporting one of their signature Sugarhill hoodies with lower case gothic lettering.</p>

<p>This admiration thing is a two way street though, Neighborhoodies now has an array of Hicks related product in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082628/http://neighborhoodies.com/catalog/soulpatrol.php">Soul Patrol store</a>, to show Hicks their support. However, they&apos;ve basically just stolen sales from the man himself, who also sells <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529082628/http://www.theofficialsoulpatrol.com/tosp_store.html">Soul Patrol t-shirts</a> on his own site! Oh well, he&apos;s gonna be rich enough anyway.</p>
