One onlooker told the paper, &quot;This is unbelievable&#x2014;and super. I&apos;m going to tell my wife to join in.&quot; The prudes guarded their eyes, and spewed terms like &quot;extreme liberalism,&quot; while others hooted and hollered in solidarity. Currently New York is the only state where women can go topless legally (since a 1992 ruling), so really, Go-Topless Day can be <em>every day</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232615/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/25/you_missed_it_topless_day_in_centra.php">Here</a> are plenty of photos from last year&apos;s march.</p>
