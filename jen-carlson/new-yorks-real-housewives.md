Are you ready to meet the <em>Real Housewives of New York City</em>? Bravo is spinning off their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171925/http://www.bravotv.com/Real_Housewives_3/index.php">Orange County-based reality show</a> with a look into the lives of some select East Coast ladies. The show will air March 4th, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171925/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/01/14/2008-01-14_bravo_spinoff_real_housewives_of_new_yor-1.html">The Daily News</a> reports that the &quot;stars&quot; will be Bethenny Frankel, LuAnn de Lesseps (that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171925/http://wcbstv.com/cbs2crew/Countess.LuAnn.de.2.231120.html">Countess</a>, to you), Ramona Singer and Jill Zarin of the Upper East Side and Alex McCord of Cobble Hill. We&apos;re glad they branched out of the UES and threw a Brooklynite in there (though we wish it was a Park Slope mom); at 34 she&apos;s the youngest of them all. 

</p><p>Is this all sounding a little <em>Cashmere Mafia</em>? It is. All of the women revolve around their jobs, but vow to party as hard as they work. While McCord is said to work in visual merchandising for a major retailer, it appears she is also an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171925/http://www.alexmccord.com/">aspiring actress</a> (surprise, surprise).The series has been filming since last summer, and the women say they don&apos;t want to be portrayed like their West Coast counterparts. McCord points out &quot;We are pretty different people. We are not in a gated community. We are in the thick of things, doing our activities and coexisting with 8 million other people.&quot; Do these look like the New York women you know? Get more details on each after the jump. </p>

<p><em>L-R: Jill Zarin (with husband), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171925/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566363">Alex McCord</a>, Ramona Singer (with husband and daughter), LuAnn deLesseps, Bethenny Frankel.</em></p>
