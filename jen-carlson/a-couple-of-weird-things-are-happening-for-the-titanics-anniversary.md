<p>On April 15th it will have been 100 years since the Titanic tragically sank, taking many passengers down into the Atlantic with it. Because of the landmark anniversary, the famous shipwreck is back in the spotlight. There&apos;s even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212249/http://www.titanicmovie.com/"><em>Titanic 3-D</em></a> movie coming out, but a 3-dimensional Celine Dion-soundtracked homage to the tragedy <em>isn&apos;t even the weirdest thing</em> occurring around the anniversary.</p>

<p>Today Groupon announced a $12,500 Titanic vacation package, which includes a tour of the shipwreck site in a deep-ocean vessel. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212249/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-groupon-offers-12500-trip-to-titanic-20120313,0,6132426.story">the Chicago Tribune</a>, &quot;The offer went live Tuesday, and just one unit is available. The package features a 13-day excursion that includes round-trip airfare from anywhere in the lower 48 states to St. John&apos;s Island, transport via &apos;a professional ship&apos; from St. John&apos;s to the Titanic site, one day of exploration on a deep-ocean vessel and admission to events relating to the 100-year anniversary of the ill-fated ship&apos;s voyage.&quot; The buyer will also get a DVD of James Cameron&apos;s <em>Titanic</em>, signed by a Missouri-based Leonardo DiCaprio impersonator. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212249/http://www.groupon.com/pages/titanic">WEIRD</a>.</p>

<p>Next up, The History Channel (who have sidelined their Hitler in favor of getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212249/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/titanic_1.php">all up in the Titanic</a> for this anniversary) will be &quot;live&quot; Tweeting the Titanic&apos;s voyage and crash. They&apos;ve already started, and you can follow along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212249/https://twitter.com/#!/TitanicRealTime">@TitanicRealTime</a>. Just three hours ago the crew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212249/https://twitter.com/#!/TitanicRealTime/status/179621970902650880">Tweeted</a>, &quot;The extent of Titanic&#x2019;s rigging is staggering, lots more still to be done before launch.&quot;</p>
