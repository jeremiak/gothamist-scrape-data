Her live shows are amongst the best we&apos;ve seen - energetic, personable and with a sound so big there&apos;s little else to do but feel a part of the music. Tomorrow afternoon she&apos;ll take the stage at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122064239/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/02/28/gothamist_austi.php">our show</a> in Austin, and we suggest coming by if you&apos;re at SXSW. For New Yorkers staying in town, she&apos;ll be playing Bowery Ballroom on March 19th. </p>

<p><strong>We saw you play a long time ago at a small place on Avenue C, do you have any interesting stories from around that time - or starting out playing smaller clubs in the city?</strong><br>
well, speaking of avenue c, there was this one time two summers ago where we had a gig at the mercury lounge. like an asshole, i was on my phone when i parked my car that morning. i went along my way and before load in went to find my car. searched the whole lower east side and east village to no avail. i thought it was stolen because i thought i left it in my usual spot by delancy, so i reported it stolen. anyways, a month later the cops call me to tell me it had been found on avenue c with a shitload of tickets all over it and that the inside looked pretty trashed. looking back i&apos;m pretty sure i just spaced it and forgot i parked on avenue c. hmmm.</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
my first memories of living in nyc was when i first started going to the monday night anti folk open mics and ended up taking a room at these two songwriters named spencer and turner in bensonhurst. they called the place balloon heaven. turner and i shared the living room and had a sheet wall. it was mad sketchy. anyways, we all just went to this open mic every monday and got drunk at niagra while waiting to play. fun days.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out?</strong><br>
well, if you want to get drunk on the early side, i like the 11th street pub between a &amp; b. i also like HiFi on sunday nights. the royal oak in Brooklyn is also an excellent place to drink and the delancy rooftop is sweet as well.  i think the best night to go out is any night other than a weekend night.</p>

<p><strong>We heard that Johnny Greenwood came to your show this past CMJ...do tell!</strong><br>
yeah i found that out the next morning. i was like WHOAAAAAAA! hahaha. when i told my drummer, he got all embarrased bc he was wearing a radiohead t shirt. hahah. hey did you know johnny greenwood did the music for the &quot;rock band&quot; in the last harry potter movie?</p>
