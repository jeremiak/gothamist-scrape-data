<p>As of today we&apos;re being told that things are &quot;looking good&quot; for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120501063811/http://gothamist.com/tags/spaceshuttle">Space Shuttle</a> Enterprise&apos;s journey to New York City tomorrow morning (though &quot;the event remains dependent on weather and will be postponed in the event of rain or strong winds.&quot;) The Shuttle&apos;s arrival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120501063811/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/space_shuttle_enterprise_is_coming.php#photo-1">has been delayed</a> by the weather since Monday, when it was first scheduled to arrive, but if everything goes smoothly it will make its grand entrance tomorrow between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m.</p>

<p>NASA won&apos;t be releasing the route, but we hear it will be doing low fly-overs over the Statue of Liberty and The Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum (its new home) before arriving at JFK airport. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120501063811/http://www.nycaviation.com/where-to-watch-space-shuttle-enterprise-in-new-york/">NYC Aviation</a> has published a map with spots to view the Shuttle from, and this <em>will</em> be a great photo opp (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120501063811/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos). In June there will be another when it gets strapped to a barge and tugged to the museum. </p>

<p>In the meantime, the Intrepid folks have just sent us over this new video, showing just how much anticipation surrounds the shuttle&apos;s arrival. Check it out below, and then maybe watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120501063811/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYCJAkeD33o"><em>Space Camp</em></a> tonight to fully immerse yourself in the Shuttle era.</p>
