<p>We&apos;ve crossed the darkened threshold of 2017, a year in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112152833/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> will undoubtedly become the most high-profile stage for comedic commentary on Trump&apos;s America. Hahahaha we&apos;re all fucked. </p>

<p>The show has announced the first hosts and musical guests of the year, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112152833/http://gothamist.com/tags/azizansari">Aziz Ansari</a> will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112152833/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/7_people_wed_rather_see_host_snl.php"><em>finally</em></a> step onto the Studio 8H stage as host on January 21st. Felicity Jones will host this coming weekend, the show&apos;s first time back in the new year.</p>

<p>Ansari&apos;s excellent show <em>Master of None</em> hit Netflix in 2015 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112152833/https://www.netflix.com/title/80049714">binge it if you haven&apos;t yet</a>), and will return for a second season later this year. </p>

<p>Last summer, Ansari <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112152833/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/25/aziz_ansari_donald_trump_makes_me_a.php">penned a piece</a> for the NY Times regarding Trump, anti-Muslim hate speech and prejudice&#x2014;&quot;It&#x2019;s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray,&quot; Ansari wrote, adding, &quot;It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense.&quot; We&apos;d expect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112152833/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/04/again_snl_mocks_donald_trumps_tweet.php">Alec Baldwin&apos;s Trump</a> to show up for Ansari&apos;s appearance.</p>
