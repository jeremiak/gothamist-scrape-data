<p>This is a neat little tip for anyone who has suffered from a case of Herbs Going Bad Before You Use Them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021208/http://www.thehungrymouse.com/2012/07/04/preserving-fresh-herbs-in-olive-oil/">The Hungry Mouse&apos;s Jessie Cross</a> points out that you can preserve herbs in olive oil or melted butter ice cubes! So simple, and yet here we are, intrigued and amazed. Maybe it&apos;s just the way olive oil looks when it&apos;s frozen?</p>

<p>Cross notes that the process allows you to go straight from the freezer to the frying pan (or perhaps straight under the skin of a chicken about to be roasted) when you are ready to use them, and the process is simple: &quot;Basically, you take your herbs, chop &#x2018;em up, and freeze them in an ice cube tray with olive oil (or melted butter, if you like).&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, you can always freeze your herbs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530021208/http://www.thegardenerseden.com/?p=13221">in broth or water</a>, as well... but that doesn&apos;t look as cool.</p>
