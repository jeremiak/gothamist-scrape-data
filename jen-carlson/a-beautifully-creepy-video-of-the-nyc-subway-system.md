title: A Beautifully Creepy Video Of The NYC Subway System
---

	
										<p>We can&apos;t decide if this video makes the subway seem beautiful, or creepy&#x2014;but we like it! Put on some headphones, turn it up to 11, and enjoy five minutes in the subway system, without having to swipe your MetroCard. This was filmed as &quot;a test/experiment to capture the inspirational sounds and visuals of the NYC subway&quot; by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115233747/http://vimeo.com/channels/timsessler">Tim Sessler</a>. It&apos;s just that, somewhere around the 3:40 mark we start to get the feeling that Jason Voorhees is about to jump out from behind a pole.</p>
