</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s been a long time since we last visited Charles W. Cushman&apos;s photos of New York (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150201034416/http://gothamist.com/2003/12/31/cushmans_new_york_photos.php">since 2003</a>, in fact&#x2014;though he&apos;s popped up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150201034416/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/30/new_york_in_the_1940s.php">here and there</a> since then). Recently his images have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150201034416/http://citynoise.org/article/10506/in/new_york@n">getting circulated again</a>, so maybe it&apos;s time to take a fresh look back at his shots from 1941 and 1942 (we&apos;ll take a look at his 1960s photos tomorrow).</p>
