                            <p>The Museum of the City of New York has released a treasure trove of old New York City photographs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928055426/http://collections.mcny.org/MCNY/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MNY_HomePage">on its website</a>. Sadly, perusing them isn&apos;t very easy over there&#x2014;or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928055426/http://kottke.org/10/12/old-photos-of-new-york-city">Kottke</a> noted, &quot;the interface is a little hinky.&quot; You&apos;ve probably seen photographs from their featured photographers before (who include Berenice Abbott and Jacob Riis)&#x2014;but there were some images that were even new to us, click through to check out some of them.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A rep for the museum tells us, &quot;This is intended to be the soft launch and we&#x2019;re planning a period of time during which we collect feedback. We&#x2019;ll re-launch a new version of the database sometime early in the new year. It&#x2019;s a work in progress and people can send comments on the site to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928055426/mailto:collections@mcny.org">collections@mcny.org</a>.&quot;</p>
