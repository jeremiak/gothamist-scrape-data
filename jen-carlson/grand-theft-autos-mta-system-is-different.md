title: Grand Theft Auto's MTA System is...Different

                            <p>Coming up on April 29th is the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130921014117/http://gothamist.com/tags/Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV">Grand Theft Auto</a> extravaganza. The game wreaks havoc on Liberty City, which is essentially a not-quite-gentrified New York City (though it takes place in the current year). The latest leak from the anticipated game is a city map (we spy Roosevelt Island) and a map of the subway system, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130921014117/http://www.gtagaming.com/news/comments.php?i=1219">everyone opining</a>. How does the Rockstar Games version of our 722-mile, 468-station subway system with 22 lines hold up?</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130921014117/http://kotaku.com/372415/gta-iv-street-map-leaked">Kotaku</a> says &quot;it&apos;s about as New York as you can get,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130921014117/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2008/03/28/appreciating-the-subways-through-grand-theft-auto/">Second Ave. Sagas</a> says that Liberty City&#x2019;s Transport Authority falls a bit short of the real MTA. The fewer stops and lines leads them to believe that &quot;we&#x2019;ll be catapulted back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when the dirty, dingy subway were crime-filled and covered in graffiti.&quot; Sounds good to us! </p>

<p>The game also has a new trailer out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130921014117/http://media.rockstargames.com/flies/traylor4/640x360.mov">watch here</a>. </p>
