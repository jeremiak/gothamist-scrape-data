Her lawyer told the paper, &quot;The guy wouldn&apos;t leave her apartment. He pushed and shoved her, then he calls the police. <strong>You&apos;re entitled to push him out of your apartment [if he doesn&apos;t voluntarily leave].&quot;</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142303/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/03/31/2009-03-31_nicholas_stefanov_boyfriend_of_real_hous.html">Bensimon claims</a> she&apos;s received threatening emails from the ex, one saying &quot;I&apos;m going to make your life misery.&quot; Meanwhile, Stefanov wants the order of protection extended. If convicted of the misdemeanor third-degree assault charges, Bensimon could face a year behind bars. Maybe she can be cellmates with the other alleged Bravo boyfriend beater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142303/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/26/kenley_says_she_doesnt_throw_her_pu.php">Kenley</a>.</p>
