There were British lords, Hamptons parties, people who aren&apos;t rich getting looked down upon by people who are rich (as well as other cookie cutter plot devices), and a number of puns involving Chuck Bass&apos;s name. Now, to insure an absolute takeover, the show has stepped off the small screen and invaded the windows of Henri Bendel. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914234408/http://racked.com/archives/2008/09/02/in_the_window_gossip_girl_at_bendels.php">Racked</a> reports on the 5th Avenue display, noting, &quot;By our count, it looks like the display features two Blairs, one Serena, one Little Jenny Humphrey, and one dark-haired other girl.&quot; Give them one more season and they&apos;ll be slumming it with their own H&amp;M; designs.  Bendel&apos;s has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914234408/http://www.observer.com/2007/henri-bendel-sees-shopping-surge-gossip-girl">one of the many NYC locations used in the show</a>--it was where Dan spied Serena in the very first episode!</p>
