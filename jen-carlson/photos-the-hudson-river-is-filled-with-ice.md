title: Photos: The Hudson River Is Filled With Ice

										<p>It&apos;s not <em>that</em> unusual to see parts of the Hudson River harden in to ice&#x2014;back in the 1800s New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180537/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/flashback_the_old_blizzards_that_st.php#photo-1">were building temporary taverns</a> on top of it!&#x2014;but it&apos;s currently got more ice than it typically does on a winter day. Ferries are still running, so it&apos;s not frozen solid&#x2014;ruining our dreams of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180537/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a80x06Wn91U"><em>Mystery, Alaska</em></a>-style hockey game after work&#x2014;but it <em>is</em> perfect for Instagram... and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180537/http://www.hriyc.org/">Hudson River Ice Yacht Club</a> is probably having fun upstate.</p>

<p>While the ice floes are causing some problems (construction on the new Tappan Zee Bridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180537/http://www.lohud.com/article/20140108/NEWS/301080032/Frozen-Hudson-River-suspends-construction-foundation-new-Tappan-Zee-Bridge">was suspended</a>), our weather expert Joe Schumacher tells us, &quot;It&apos;s far from frozen... the ice isn&apos;t solid at all except maybe where the water is still between the piers. If we get a good cold spell the Hudson will freeze down here.&quot; But why don&apos;t we see an ice-filled East River? Schumacher believes it may be because the East River is more salty and moves faster&#x2014;&quot;The Hudson has a layer of fresh water, which freezes at a higher temperature, above a layer of salt water.  Plus the fresh water is moving down from upriver, where the river regularly freezes.&quot;</p>
