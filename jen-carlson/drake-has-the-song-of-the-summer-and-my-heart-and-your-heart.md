<p>In the last, cold days of winter, I can&apos;t say I cared much about Drake. I knew &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925185855/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/director-x-on-making-drakes-dance-crazy-meme-ready-hotline-bling-20151023">Hotline Bling</a>&quot; and appreciated that video, mostly for the man&apos;s goofy dance moves which I felt I could easily replicate in my bedroom, alone, after a few drinks. If I felt like it. &quot;Drake like no one is watching,&quot; etc. I also appreciated his Canadianness, as well as his smile, which can make even the most stone-faced sociopath blush.  </p>

<p>Just before he did double-duty on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> as host and musical guest in May, I decided to listen to some more of his catalogue, since I was going to be at this <em>SNL</em> taping. I forgot to. So my first introduction to &quot;One Dance,&quot; where I was cognizant of it at least (maybe I heard it in a Trader Joe&apos;s once?), was in Studio 8H. </p>

<p>SOLD. I was sold. I loved this performance, and this song, and after the show I saw Drake, standing just a few feet away from me, smiling, and it was like looking... I don&apos;t know. I tried to find a good example of what I could compare seeing Drake smile in person to, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925185855/https://www.google.com/search?q=looking+at+most+beautiful+thing+in+world&amp;oq=looking+at+most+beautiful+thing+in+world&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5055j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google was like</a>: Nothing, you cannot explain or touch beauty, you can only feel it in your heart. Or maybe it&apos;s salt flats?</p>

<p>Drake is a salt flat, and his songs are our anthems. But why are you reading about my thoughts and feelings on Drake? Because I needed a way to deliver you some big Drake news: &quot;One Dance&quot; (Ft. Kyla &amp; Wizkid) has been named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925185855/http://bit.ly/2bTN5hM">Billboard&apos;s No. 1 Song of the Summer of 2016</a>. But why stop there? Let it also be our song of Autumn&#x2014;maybe pair it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925185855/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-31/dress-like-drake-with-these-six-turtleneck-sweaters">with one of these turtleneck sweaters</a> and a PSL.</p>
