The show has been on the air for 4 years, having quickly become an institution for music fans and a place for bands (local and otherwise) to showcase their videos. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>This season promises a mix of new and old, with everyone from Yeasayer to Les Savy Fav popping up throughout in unique sonic-driven segments. We recently got some off-air answers about the show from creator/editor/producer/superwoman, Shirley Braha. You&apos;ve probably seen her at a concert or two.</em> </p>

<p><strong>How long have you been involved with New York Noise?</strong> I created New York Noise during a summer internship at NYC TV before my senior year at Smith College- summer of &apos;03. I&apos;ve been producing and editing the show since.</p>

<p><strong>How many bands submit their videos to you in any given month?</strong> I usually receive 2 or 3 packages a day, but I didn&apos;t get any today so I silently wept under my desk. Everyone was like, &quot;OMG, What&apos;s wrong?&quot; and I&apos;m like, &quot;Nothing, I&apos;m just under a lot of pressure you guys, you wouldn&apos;t understand.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Is there one video in particular that has stood out in the past, and one right now?</strong> This question is too hard. I think on technical and artistic merits, the new Hot Chip video for &quot;Ready for the Floor&quot; is really amazing. There are a handful of other new videos i really like now, mostly cause the songs are awesome: Evangelicals &quot;Midnight Vignette&quot; (I danced to this last night after everyone left the office); King Khan &quot;Waddling Around&quot;; Jeremy Jay &quot;Airwalker&quot;; Love of Diagrams &quot;No Way Out&quot;  (PS- I have 677 other videos on my hard drive).</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a favorite segment? And episode?</strong> Right now I feel like one of those people who call every movie their &quot;favorite movie.&quot; There are 77 episodes of New York Noise so far, so it&apos;s hard to pick favorites. I like some of the weirder stuff....  Adam Green Variety Hour; Blind Date with Nicole Atkins &amp; J from The Cloud Room; Eugene Mirman giving out fried fish; Fischerspooner fighting with each other; Beirut &apos;Making the Video&apos; parody; My Super Sweet Bar-mitzvah; Siren Fest 06 hosted by a pageant winner; Antiques Rockshow; Battles in Band Therapy; anything with MC Steinberg. I archived some of that old stuff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073914/http://www.youtube.com/shirleybeans">on YouTube</a>.</p>
