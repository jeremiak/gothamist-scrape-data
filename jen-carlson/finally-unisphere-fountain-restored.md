<p>One small step for the remains of the 1964 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508160932/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldsfair">World&#x2019;s Fair site</a>: the Unisphere Fountain has been restored and reopened after nearly $2 million in improvements! Earlier this week Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe &amp; Co. cut the ribbon at the site of the Queens icon at Flushing Meadows Corona Park. The Unisphere was officially designated a New York City Landmark in 1995, and this is the first time the fountain has been operational since that designation was made. In the below video, Benepe says the fountains haven&apos;t been on for 15 to 20 years, and he refers to the area as the Versailles in New York, &quot;the palace grounds for regular people.&quot;<br>

<p>Prior to this makover&#x2014;in fact, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508160932/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/21/neglected_unisphere_sprouts_grass_i.php">last summer</a>&#x2014;the fountain was so neglected that it began to sprout grass through its cracks.</p>
