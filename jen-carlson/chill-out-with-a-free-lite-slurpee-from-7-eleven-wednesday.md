<p>This week 7-Eleven is introducing their new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152408/http://dcist.com/2012/05/7-eleven_to_introduce_lower-calorie.php">Slurpee Lite</a>, which is sugar-free, and contains 50% fewer calories (20 calories for 8 ounces), and marks the first time in 45 years (that&apos;s how long the Slurpee has been around) that the Slurpee is being offered to the sugar-free set. </p>

<p>To celebrate the launch, 7-Eleven has announced SlurpFREE Day, which is tomorrow! Their stores from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152408/http://www.7-eleven.com/Locator.aspx">coast to coast</a> will offer a free 7.11 ounce Slurpee drink to one and all from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152408/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110950/">Lelaina Pierce</a> once said, this is &quot;the most profound, important invention of my lifetime... you have your essential vitamins and nutrients for the entire day.&quot; Keep in mind, she was talking about the forty-four ouncer, not this wimpy 7.11 ouncer... so you&apos;ll need to make a few stops during the day if you want to get all your vitamins.</p>
