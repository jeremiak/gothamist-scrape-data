<p>Citi Field is losing its iconic Pepsi porch, Williamsburg&apos;s waterfront <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529175312/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/19/domino_williamsburg_demo.php#photo-1">was stripped</a> of its Domino Sugar sign (for now), the Kentile Floors sign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529175312/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/30/sad_4-second_timelapse_shows_kentil.php">came down last year</a>, and now the Bronx will be bidding farewell to its History Channel sign, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529175312/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/nyregion/30metjournal.html">such a nice view</a>. Yes, they&apos;re all basically advertisements, but they look so much nicer than billboards, incorporating neon and/or metal work.</p>

<p>The History Channel sign lived atop 20 Bruckner Blvd, seen while crossing the Harlem River, and has been there for years, but recently lost all of its letters save the &quot;H.&quot; That will soon come down, too, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529175312/http://www.welcome2thebronx.com/wordpress/2016/01/12/iconic-history-channel-sign-permanently-coming-down/">according to Welcome2theBronx</a>, where Ed Garcia Conde writes, &quot;It might not seem like much to many but for others it was a sign that we knew we were home.&quot;</p>

<p>Conde notes that &quot;it will be replaced with a new sign and available for advertising January 18th of this year. The representative also confirmed that The History Channel will not be renewing its contract to advertise at that location.&quot; No word on what&apos;s replacing it. Probably a soulless Duane Reade sign.</p>
