										<p><em>Move over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507114032/http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/03/cakespy-cadbury-creme-eggs-benedict-dessert-breakfast-recipe.html">Cadbury Eggs Benedict</a>, we spent yesterday in the kitchen coming up with our own ways to put a spin on everyone&apos;s favorite Easter treats. The results are below, so if you aren&apos;t scared of mutilating a cute Peeps with a hand blender (or any of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507114032/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/03/st_whatsinside_eastercandy/">these ingredients</a>), dig in...</em></p>

<p><strong>PEEPS WITH FRIED PLANTAINS AND MINT RIBBONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
&#x2022;1 Plantain (yellow and black, not green)<br>
&#x2022;One Peeps<br>
&#x2022;Mint<br>
&#x2022;Vegetable Oil</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong> Fill a sauce pan up with about 2 inches of vegetable oil and heat it up while you slice the plantains (into 1/4 or 1/2 inch sections). Once the oil is hot put the plantains in (be careful) and fry until they have browned (about 5 to 7 minutes). Take off the heat and place plantains on a paper towel to soak up the oil. </p>

<p>Roll up a mint leaf or two and cut slices of ribbons for the garnish.</p>

<p>Now assemble your plate, with the Peeps as the centerpiece! (Fun fact: fried plantains only have about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507114032/http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/generic/fried-plantains/">130 calories per serving</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
&#x2022;1 Cadbury Creme Egg<br>
&#x2022;2 Peeps<br>
&#x2022;1 Graham Cracker<br>
&#x2022;1 Basil leaf<br>
&#x2022;Red sprinkles</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong> Cut the Cadbury Creme Egg horizontally down the center and scoop out the insides. Place the &quot;yolk&quot; in a bowl with two Peeps and blend together with a hand blender until whipped. Place this inside of the hollow chocolate shells (warning: it&apos;s like working with Crazy Glue! Very sticky.) Garnish with red sprinkles (&quot;paprika&quot;), and assemble your plate, crushing graham crackers over it.</p>
