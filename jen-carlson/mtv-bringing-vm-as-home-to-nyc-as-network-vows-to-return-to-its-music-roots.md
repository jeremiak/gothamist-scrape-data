<p>Yesterday, MTV stopped their original programming, and as the reality show record scratched you could almost hear the gasp of a nation... they started playing Prince&apos;s music videos. Full videos, all the way to the end. </p>

<p>These kinds of moments on MTV haven&apos;t existed for some time, but they used to be the most special ones&#x2014;there was a feeling of solidarity when the company stopped business-as-usual to recognize something much of the world was feeling in that moment. Just think about what channel you turned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203754/http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/101190/kurt-cobain-1967-1994.jhtml">on April 8th, 1994</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203754/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/22/prince_tribute_rip.php">tribute to Prince</a> came just after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203754/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-mtv-music-videos-unplugged-kendrick-lamar-20160421-story.html">the LA Times</a> reported that the network (under the leadership of new president Sean Atkins) is getting back to its roots&#x2014;putting music at the forefront, bringing back shows like &quot;Unplugged,&quot; and reinventing themselves... or returning to themselves. Our <em>Jersey Shore</em> nightmare is coming to an end.</p>

<p>And with that, the new news of the hour is that they&apos;ll be coming home for their annual Video Music Awards. This year the VMAs are taking place at Madison Square Garden&#x2014;their first time at the venue, but not their first in New York, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203754/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award">the awards show</a> originated at Radio City Music Hall. In a press release sent out last night:</p>

<blockquote>MTV today announced that the 2016 &#x201C;MTV Video Music Awards&#x201D; will air on Sunday, August 28 live from Madison Square Garden for the first time in the show&#x2019;s 33-year history. 
 <br><br>
&#x201C;The VMAs at MSG is a New York story too good to resist,&#x201D; said Sean Atkins, President of MTV. &#x201C;The VMAs deliver some of pop culture&#x2019;s most defining moments and we&#x2019;re grateful to our New York home and Madison Square Garden for rolling out the red carpet for what is sure to be the biggest night in music.   You can be assured we are going put on a show that celebrates the city and that creates yet another seminal moment in music history at this iconic venue.&quot;
 <br><br>
&quot;We are excited that MTV will bring the VMAs back to its original home of New York City,&quot; said Mayor Bill de Blasio. &quot;From the red carpet to the accolades to the performances&#x2014;and everything in between&#x2014;the VMAs are an incredible showcase for so many talented artists. It also goes without saying that hosting the awards in our City means a boost to our small businesses and restaurants and more jobs for the thousands of crew members who work to bring the show into homes around the world.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>From the 1991 VMAs, hosted in Los Angeles, Prince:</p>

<p>The network (notorious for not making their old footage available online) has now uploaded some more from their Prince archives&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905203754/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAUO8EhsSTz02stvKDupChQ/videos">check it out here</a>.</p>
