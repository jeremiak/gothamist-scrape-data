<p>To get back on top, he&apos;s pulling out all the punches... or pleats, as it were. BW explains that &quot;after outfitting the world of 18-to-30-year-olds in all manner of T-shirts and leggings, American Apparel is going preppy, diving into more sophisticated garments such as blazers, pleated pants, button-down shirts, and more formal lace tops.&quot; You know who will eat this &apos;80s prep stuff up? Hipsters!</p>

<p>Charney believes that &quot;kids are moving away from piercings,&quot; and says he wants &quot;to grow old with our customer. We want to be a traditional American clothier.&quot; And nothing says traditional like a hot pink <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310134031/http://www.americanapparel.com/rsans302.html?cid=30">Nylon Spandex Micro-Mesh Bodysuit</a>.</p>
