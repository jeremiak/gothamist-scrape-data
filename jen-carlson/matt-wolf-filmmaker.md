Wolf&apos;s film, Wild Combinations, opens at the IFC Center on September 26th, and even if you aren&apos;t familiar with Russell or his work you&apos;ll get a beautiful, intimate look at the musician that will leave you craving more (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114733/http://www.arthurrussellmovie.com/pgs/highres.html">watch the trailer here</a>).</em></p>

<p><strong>How did you become interested in Arthur Russell?</strong> A friend of mine told me about a gay disco auteur from Oskaloosa, Iowa, who would ride the Staten Island Ferry, obsessively listening to mixes of his own cassettes in the 1980s.  That image alone really interested me, but when I heard Arthur&#x2019;s music I became obsessively involved.  Arthur really embodied many of the cultural moments that have always intrigued me&#x2014;underground disco, the downtown avant-garde of the 1970s and 80s, and the experience of being queer in New York at that time.</p>

<p><strong>How did you approach making the documentary?</strong> I come from an experimental filmmaking background, so I was cautious about some of the traps of the conventional music documentary.  I chose to really limit the amount of characters I included in the film.  Instead I focused a great deal on Arthur&#x2019;s former boyfriend Tom Lee and his parents Chuck and Emily Russell in Oskaloosa.  I also needed to create a compelling visual language to bring Arthur to life since there is so little archival footage of him.  I used an actor, Arthur&#x2019;s actual clothes, and outmoded VHS and Super8 formats to shoot evocative recreations&#x2014;on the Staten Island Ferry, in cornfields, and more.  The result, I hope, is an intimate and personal portrait of Arthur rather than a definitive biography.   <br>
 <br>
<strong>How long did it take from beginning to end?</strong> The whole filmmaking process took 2 years.  And I&#x2019;ve been traveling quite a bit with the film for the past year&#x2026; &#x201C;on tour&#x201D; for Arthur you might say. </p>
