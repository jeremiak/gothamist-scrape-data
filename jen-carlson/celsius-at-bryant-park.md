<p>It a big week for New York&apos;s newly open-for-the-season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093008/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/20/polar_rink_opens.php">ice skating rinks</a>. Bryant Park&apos;s rink, which is seasonally surrounded by holiday shops, now has a giant glass restaurant sitting by its side as well. </p>

<p>Celsius (housed in a tent previous years) is having a grand opening this weekend in their 7,000 square foot, all glass, two-story building. The balcony overlooking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093008/http://www.bryantpark.org/amenities/thepond.php">the park and rink</a> is even complete with outdoor heat lamps for staying toasty. </p>

<p>They menu was created by the Buddha Bar team, helmed by Chef John Keller and Chef Andy Seidel, and you can expect &quot;great comfort food with a Canadian accent. Menu items include: Bison and Three Bean Chili, Canadian Cheddar Mac &amp; Cheese, Maple Leaf Cosmo, Northern Lights Lemonade.&quot; Full drink and food menus after the jump; and with drinks ranging from $7 to 14 and soups and salads from $8 to 16, it&apos;s a good thing the rink admission is free!</p>
