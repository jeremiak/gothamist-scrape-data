Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020126/http://gothamist.com/tags/thegreatgatsby"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a> hits the big screen next month, it will be just as the author intended, in 3-D and featuring a Jay-Z produced soundtrack. While that&apos;s all very #hip and #modern, it was troubling us that Luhrmann &amp; Co. might be missing out on cornering even <em>more</em> of the millennial demo&#x2014;but hey, we&apos;re not in show biz, we never stood a chance at figuring out how to tap into those remaining ticket sales to today&apos;s youth. Enter: Carey Mulligan, who totally <em>nails it</em> in next month&apos;s issue of <em>Vogue</em>.</p>

<p>Luhrmann&apos;s 27-year-old secret weapon introduces the K-factor to the equation, telling the magazine that her character in the film, Daisy Buchanan, is just &quot;like a Kardashian!&quot; Ca-ching! Mulligan says:</p><blockquote>&quot;It&apos;s that kind of feeling: I&apos;m-so-little-and-there&apos;s-nothing-to-me, watch-me-have-nothing-to-me. She feels like she&apos;s living in a movie of her own life. She&apos;s constantly on show, performing all the time. Nothing bad can happen in a dream. You can&apos;t die in a dream. She&apos;s in her own TV show. She&apos;s like a Kardashian.&quot;</blockquote>Sure, there&apos;s something to that&#x2014;Daisy <em>is</em> one enigmatic broad with so little to offer&#x2014;but still, we almost made it through this life without a Kardashian tainting the world of great literature. And now that&apos;s all gone, so, fuck it, Myrtle Wilson is such a Charlotte.<p></p>
