<p>This afternoon, Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200552/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/21/de_blasio_snow_warning.php">updated the city</a> on the status of the latest snowstorm and how it&apos;s being handled. Not much has changed since, but at tonight&apos;s press conference at the Office of Emergency Management, de Blasio warned that the storm has intensified, and we should now expect 10 to 14&quot; of the white stuff. Snow day! Just kidding, kids&#x2014;the Mayor says they are currently operating as if schools will be open. However, he did say that during the last storm, which was smaller, school ultimately ended up being canceled because of how cold it was. He also said tomorrow is going to be colder. So, do the math. <strong>Update:</strong> Just after 11 p.m. it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200552/http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/mediarelations/NewsandSpeeches/2013-2014/School+open+12214.htm">was announced</a> schools will be OPEN on Wednesday, but &quot;Travel conditions may be difficult, and families should exercise their own judgment when taking their children to school.&quot;</p>

<p>And it will be &quot;unusually cold,&quot; the Mayor stressed several times&#x2014;in the teens or lower, not taking into account the wind. The same common sense rules apply: stay inside, check on your neighbors, don&apos;t drive (it&apos;s dangerous and the clogged roads are not helping the Dept. of Sanitation do their job), oops did you go outside? Build a snowman. And always stick to mass transit (check the MTA&apos;s website for soul crushing updates regarding your commute). Bundle up! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200552/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/bad_weather_tipping.php">Tip your delivery guy</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200552/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/21/do_you_use_an_umbrella_in_the_snow.php">Don&apos;t use an umbrella</a>. You got this, New York.</p>

<p>As for the plowing&#x2014;the Sanitation Commissioner, John Doherty, was on hand tonight and admitted &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200552/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSZd6MnEuLw">It&apos;s not very good, actually</a>.&quot; And they blame the traffic for that, noting it slows things down for them. Responding to claims that the Upper East Side was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200552/http://nypost.com/2014/01/21/upper-east-side-residents-feel-spurned-after-plow-delay/">particularly neglected</a> by plows today&#x2014;with complaints from residents and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200552/http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/nycsevereweather/weather_plowtracker.shtml">the plow tracker</a> showing almost no activity there&#x2014;he said the GPS was not working there, and also that there was more traffic in that area, but if you &quot;look now, it will be green.&quot; As of the 8 o&apos;clock hour here&apos;s what it looks like (green means last serviced 0-1 hours ago, blue is 1-3 hours ago, and yellow is 3-6 hours ago):</p>
