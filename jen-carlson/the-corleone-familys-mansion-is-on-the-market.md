<p>Did you know <em>The Godfather</em> production set up shop at the Norton family&apos;s home on Staten Island for a whole year and a half? In the early &apos;70s, 110 Longfellow Avenue became the site of the Corleone mansion&#x2014;and Mrs. Norton filmed about 8 hours of behind the scene footage (check out the interview with her son below), which will hopefully end up on DVD one day.</p>

<p>Well, now the home is for sale&#x2014;the Nortons are leaving after 50 years! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518021944/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/realestate/residential/berry_nice_6IhEYHygyATt1EiaBPoqcP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">The NY Post</a> reports that it&apos;s going for $2.9 million, or you can just make them an offer they can&apos;t refuse.
