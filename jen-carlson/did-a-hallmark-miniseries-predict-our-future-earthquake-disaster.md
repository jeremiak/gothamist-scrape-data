<p>Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325082730/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/24/remembering_the_earthquake_of_yeste.php">last summer</a> when New York City suffered through thirty seconds of tremors, and we noted that seismologists said there will probably be more to come? We also noted that the last big one was over 120 years ago (with an epicenter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325082730/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/flashback_nyc_earthquake_of_1884.php">at Rockaway Beach</a>), and then pointed to a 2008 Columbia University study which noted that the city has several fault lines (including one along 125th Street), and we&apos;re due for a quake in the 5.0 or higher range. Well, welcome to last July, internet! Today everyone is chattering about this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325082730/http://www.metro.us/newyork/local/article/774165--nyc-past-due-for-a-big-quake">Metro</a> article which said pretty much the same thing, adding this bit of scaremongering from a seismologist: <strong>&quot;New York City is due for another big quake... It can happen anytime soon. We can expect it any minute.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>Columbia University scientists are expanding their seismometer network&#x2014;they currently maintain six throughout the five boroughs, at New York City landmarks. This summer one will be placed in the arch at Washington Square Park, and another in Bryant Park. If we <em>lucked out</em> with &quot;just&quot; a magnitude 5 earthquake, &quot;Manhattan&#x2019;s skyscrapers would not fall down, but brick buildings and chimneys could topple.&quot; Anything higher and it&apos;ll be a scene out of Hallmark&apos;s miniseries <em>Aftershock: Earthquake In New York</em>... except we won&apos;t have Tom Skerrit to save us.</p>
