<p>For the first time ever, except for every time we&apos;ve dreamed about it, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler (who have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505003054/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1850457/">a movie</a> coming out soon) will be hosting <em>Saturday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505003054/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxqycijBUn0">Night Cheese</a> Live</em> together. We thought we hit the high water mark with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505003054/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/30/video_louis_ck_saturday_night_live.php">Louis CK</a>, but this, THIS, is as good as this show will ever get. And it&apos;s going to be great. And it&apos;s going to happen on December 19th. And it will be the last SNL of 2015, and maybe ever, because where do we go from here?</p>

<p>Oh wait, it GETS BETTER. Bruce The Fucking Boss Springsteen is going to be the musical guest.  </p>

<p>Leading up to this magical day, we&apos;ll get new episodes hosted by Ryan Gosling (December 5th), and Chris Hemsworth (December 12th), with Leon Bridges and Chance the Rapper as musical guests, respectively.</p>
