										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="blinkcover.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142825im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/blinkcover.jpg" width="325" height="325" class="image-right"> </span>One time I went to see Blink-182 in concert at Jones Beach, and Jimmy Fallon opened, and the power went out during someone&apos;s set &#x2014; it was crazy! Sure, I was out of college already while many in attendance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142825/http://2manweave.blogspot.com/2011/07/retroactive-diary-from-my-first-concert.html">were there experiencing their first ever concert</a>... but the age gap wasn&apos;t embarrassing. We All Love Blink-182, and that stands true even today. Right guys? Are you with me?! If not, you can stop reading now and go back to listening to that indie record that&apos;s so much cooler than theirs. </p>

<p>If you are still here, your thank you letter from Tom DeLonge (the cutest one) is in the mail. But keep reading... the band is playing a special, intimate show at Music Hall of Williamsburg on September 11th, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142825/http://www.ticketmaster.com/blink-182-brooklyn-new-york-09-11-2013/event/00004B09E6578FB5?artistid=790708&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1">tickets go on sale</a> this Friday. And you know you wanna go because no one can deliver a punchy faux-punk song like these guys. Plus it&apos;s guaranteed that any song from their third album will make you feel like makin&apos; out like you&apos;re in high school again. Whatever that means. Who cares! Blink-182!</p>

<p>Tickets for the show go on sale Friday at noon, but the Amex presale starts Thursday at noon.</p>
