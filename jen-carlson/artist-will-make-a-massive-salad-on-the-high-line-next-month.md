<p>Performance artist Alison Knowles is bringing her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160818214742/http://www.aknowles.com/salad.html">Make a Salad</a> piece to the High Line on Earth Day, April 22nd. The piece was first staged in Baltimore in 1962, and has since been performed around the world&#x2014;below you can watch the event as it took place at the Tate Modern in 2008. During the piece, Knowles makes a giant salad, which is later served to those in attendance. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160818214742/http://www.thehighline.org/events/all/2012/4/high-line-art-performance-alison-knowles-make-a-salad">the press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Alison Knowles is an influential figure in contemporary art and in the world of performance,&#x201D; said Cecilia Alemani, the Donald R. Mullen, Jr. Curator and Director of High Line Art. &#x201C;I look forward to re-staging her legendary work for the first time in a public space in New York City. The performance will unite the playfulness of a great artist with the joy of sharing a communal meal at a breathtaking location on the High Line.&#x201D;</blockquote>
