title: Central Park: You Are Safe From Rabid Raccoons, For Now

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0610raccoon.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211041im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0610raccoon.jpg" width="216" height="246" class="image-right"> </span>Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211041/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/08/raccoons.php">in December</a> the Bad Old Days had returned in Central Park, but this time it wasn&apos;t the threat of man that concerned locals, it was animal! The number of rabid raccoons had gotten out of control, and an official warning was put out by the Department of Health. And since the city&apos;s population isn&apos;t foaming at the mouth now, we can only assume that we dodged some <em>I Am Legend</em> style outbreak, right? Right! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211041/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/01/2010-07-01_central_parks_rabid_raccoons_officials_move_quickly_to_stem_spike_in_number_of_s.html">the Daily News</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211041/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/16/rabid_raccoons.php">vaccination program</a> the DoH instituted may have just worked.</p>

<p>Bob Marino, the head of the NY Council of Dog Owners group, told the paper, &quot;We haven&apos;t heard of any new official or anecdotal reports of incidents with dogs or people in the park, and we definitely would have heard. I think the spate [of cases] last year made the city more responsive. They did a remarkable job, because capturing these things is not easy.&quot; Indeed, between February and April 237 raccoons were trapped, vaccinated and released, others that appeared ill were euthanized, while some were found dead.</p>

<p>Currently no rabid raccoons have been spotted in the park for 3 weeks&#x2014;and to put that number in perspective, back in April approximately 11 were found <em>every week</em>. But are we really safe? Because those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211041/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/09/possums.php">opposums</a> have been eerily quiet as of late...</p>
