He loses. So, back to the beginning... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522143528/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/08/star_trek_fans.php">a few years ago</a> there was an epic Christie&apos;s auction that catered to the world&apos;s most crazed fans: Trekkies. Items on the block went for much more than estimated, and the History Channel even streamed the auction action live.</p>

<p>Now one disgruntled fan<strike>boy</strike>man has sued the auction house to the tune of $7 million for selling him knock-offs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522143528/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/star_trek_fan_lawsuit_against_christie_t4SVN248kltMCFkxnDbdRK">The NY Post</a> reports that Ted Moustakis claimed Christie&apos;s intentionally lied about three items he won at auction, all to do with his favorite character Commander Data. He had scored a $6,600 poker visor, an $11,000 poker table, and a $6,000 uniform &#x2014;&#xA0;and signed an agreement that the property was being sold &quot;as is.&quot;</p>

<p>Moustakis claimed he was told they were &quot;one of a kind,&quot; however, and &quot;used by Data himself.&quot; But when he met the character IRL, he told him: &quot;That&apos;s not my visor.&quot; Allegedly more research was done to prove the items were bogus, but yesterday the case was tossed aside anyway. A panel of judges said, he &quot;<strong>should just have asked for his money back... not boldly sued for a small fortune.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Not only did the Trekkie lose his case, but when it was first filed even Wil Wheaton (<em>of Star Trek fame!</em>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522143528/http://snafu-ed.blogspot.com/2007/12/star-trek-tng-fan-sues-christies-over.html">spoke out against him</a>, saying, &quot;There are no &apos;one-of-a-kind&apos; spacesuits for regular cast members... I think it&apos;s more likely that this guy has buyer&apos;s remorse.&quot; Amateurs, let&apos;s stay out of the auction houses, &apos;kay?</p>
