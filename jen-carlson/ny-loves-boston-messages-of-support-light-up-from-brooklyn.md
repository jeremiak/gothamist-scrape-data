</div></div>					<p>Last night the side of the Brooklyn Academy of Music&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513234219/http://www.bam.org/visit/buildings/peter-jay-sharp-building">Peter Jay Sharp building</a> became a canvas, displaying messages of support for Boston. The messages projected read: &quot;Peace and Love,&quot; &quot;It shouldn&apos;t take a tragedy for us to come together,&quot; &quot;Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that&quot; (a Martin Luther King, Jr. quote), and NY &#x2665; B (in the Red Sox font). </p>

<p>These were created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513234219/https://twitter.com/NYCLightBrigade">NYC Light Brigade</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513234219/https://twitter.com/illuminator99">The Illuminator</a> (&quot;a political art project that emerged out of Occupy Wall Street&quot;) who use light projections to display their messages. As of right now (12:10 a.m.) they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513234219/http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/31527381?utm_campaign=t.co&amp;utm_source=31527381&amp;utm_medium=social">still airing the stream</a> from outside of BAM on Lafayette.</p>

<p>This afternoon&apos;s explosions at the Boston Marathon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513234219/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/explosion_at_finish_line_of_boston.php#photo-1">killed 3 people</a>, and injured over 100 (with dozens still in critical and serious condition). The FBI has taken the lead on the investigation, which is ongoing.
