<p>Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113510/http://gothamist.com/tags/mtv">MTV</a>&apos;s <em>Sex in the &apos;90s</em> series? The show started just before <em>The Real World</em> first premiered in 1992, and gave viewers a look at how some handpicked members of society dealt with dating and sex in the early &apos;90s... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113510/http://sfist.com/2012/11/30/the_photograph_that_changed_the_fac.php">a time that was a little scary</a> when it came to casual sex. </p>

<p>Two of the standout &quot;stars&quot; in this series were The Dog Brothers from Long Island, who really set a nice high bar for the men of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113510/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a>, who would stagger in their footsteps decades later. If you&apos;ve never heard of them (or just want to gaze once more upon their leather-tanned abs) click play, be truly horrified, and leave with a newfound appreciation for today&apos;s scripted &quot;reality&quot; show stars.</p>
