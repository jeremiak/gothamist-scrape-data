<p>Next month photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125558/http://www.ericasimone.com/">Erica Simone</a> will unveil her nude self-portraits in an exhibit titled &quot;Nue York: Self-Portraits of a Bare Urban Citizen.&quot; The 20 photographs feature Simone all over the city&#x2014;from the Bowery to the Bronx&#x2014;sans clothing. They include her shoveling snow, panhandling, window shopping, eating a hot dog (<em>of course</em>), checking out some books at the library, getting bent over a car by a police officer, and so on. They are all too NSFW to post here, but if you have some privacy, we promise not to judge if you click through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125558/http://www.nue-york.com/#!__gallery">to the exhibit&apos;s gallery of images</a>.</p>

<p>To get an up close look, the show runs at Dash Gallery (that&apos;s Damon Dash, not a Kardashian thing) from April 14th through the 28th. The press release tells us: &quot;Simone publicly bares all, raising the philosophy behind &apos;just being,&apos; as well as playing with the idea of &apos;counter-fashion&apos;&#x2014;that without clothing, people could not possibly socially interpret each other.&quot; Though it may be easy to interpret a photographer using nudity to stir up controversy! Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125558/http://gothamist.com/tags/zachhyman">Zach Hyman</a> did this years ago, and even he wasn&apos;t the first.</p>
