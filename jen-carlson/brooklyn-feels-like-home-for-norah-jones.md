So a little (epic) financial crisis certainly isn&apos;t going to stop her from throwing down millions on some Brooklyn real estate. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914034852/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2009/02/norah_jones_ste.php">Brownstoner</a> reports on the Cobble Hill home, a 4,100-square-foot circa 1843 townhouse that Jones paid $4,990,000 for (allegedly barely below the asking price).The site also notes the &quot;killer&quot; parlor floors and the not-so-killer nouveau-Tuscany vibe in the kitchen&#x2014;which actually sort of screams &quot;adult contemporary&quot;!</p>
