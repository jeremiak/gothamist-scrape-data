</p><p>Philly band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025733/http://www.wearethehumantelevision.com/"><b>Human Television</b></a> is often described as jangly. Jangly nostalgic slack rock. Simple yet intelligent melodies and rhythms that, no matter how jaded you are, will make you tap your foot and smile. Recently Gothamist heard the bands live set on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025733/http://www.kexp.org/">KEXP</a> and we instantly found ourselves removed from the fluorescent white noise in our office, briefly put in a better mood. Tonight they play (with some other bands we love) at Pianos, details after the interview. <br>
<b>Human Television</b> are <b>Boyd Shropshire</b>, <b>Billy Downing</b>, <b>Mario Lopez</b> and <b>Richard Davis</b>. This week guitarist Boyd took some time to answer our questions...</p>

<p><b>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate? </b><br>
Billy found this article about people that have the ability to pick up light rays and sound and they call themselves Human Televisions. We thought it sounded cool.</p>

<p><b>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York? </b><br>
We played at this halloween party. The good part was that I walked around all night with a fake beard and sunglasses on. I think I was trying to be Will Oldham, but we played real late and no one was there. Then at like 3 am we had to drive back to Philly. It was pretty rough.</p>

<p><b>What is your favorite/least favorite thing about playing shows in New York? </b><br>
Hopefully tonight&apos;s show will be amazing. My favorite thing is just being able to hear everything correctly, and then we can really relax on stage. Sound guys in new york aren&apos;t very used to our sound, and its hard to find a decent one.</p>

<p><b>How does the Philly music scene differ from New York&apos;s? </b><br>
Philly&apos;s music scene is okay. The Khyber gets some decent bands. We haven&apos;t really played there, even though we live there,  so its hard to compare the two.</p>
