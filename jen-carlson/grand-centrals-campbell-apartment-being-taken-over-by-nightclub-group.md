<p>The Campbell Apartment is undoubtedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235950/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/10/campbell_apartment_grand_central.php">a very special place in NYC</a>&#x2014;an out-of-the-way haven in Grand Central with some history and a good Old Fashioned. And hopefully it&apos;s going to stay that way.</p>

<p>It started out as an office space for John W. Campbell in 1923. It was never a residence, but Campbell&#x2014;a railroad tycoon who served on New York Central&apos;s Board of Directors&#x2014;did entertain there, adding a piano and pipe organ, and often inviting around 50 guests to come hear famous musicians play private recitals. Under Campbell&apos;s lock and key, the room was transformed from a bare barracks to a galleried hall of a 13th century Florentine palace. But after his death the place lost its patina. It wasn&apos;t until the late 1990s that its old glamour was revived, thanks to Mark Grossich who spent $2.5 million on restoring the space.</p>

<p>And now he is losing it. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235950/http://nypost.com/2016/04/06/campbell-apartment-dodges-eviction-from-grand-central/">The NY Post</a> reports that Grossich has sued the MTA and &quot;temporarily staved off eviction in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday,&quot; but he will eventually have to vacate. Grossich is paying $16,000/month, and requested that the MTA perform an independent real estate appraisal of the space, which is required by law. They didn&apos;t.</p>

<p>During what Grossich&apos;s lawyer calls an &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235950/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-boot-grand-central-campbell-apartment-residents-article-1.2591137">illegal and unfair</a>&quot; bidding process, he lost the space to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235950/http://gerberbars.com/scott-gerber">Scott Gerber</a>, who runs The Gerber Group (which includes Irvington, a restaurant and bar in a Manhattan W Hotel). MTA spokesman Stephen Morello explained to the paper that Grossich had been operating on a month-to-month lease, and Gerber offered &#x201C;significantly more&#x201D; money for the space.</p>

<p>He plans to open a revived version of the Campbell Apartment in August&#x2014;&quot;We really want to bring the place back to what we feel it should be,&quot; he told the Post, &quot;It&#x2019;s such an iconic bar, but we feel it&#x2019;s been neglected.&quot;</p>

<p>The space currently has a nice worn-in feel, which is kind of fitting for a bar being run out of a gorgeous old train station. We&apos;ve reached out to Gerber for a better idea on the kind of vibe he hopes to bring in, and will update if we hear back. Grand Central doesn&apos;t need a nightclub, it needs a place to sit down and enjoy a drink before that train ride to suburbia. Though an enforced dress code for the cargo short-wearing, luggage-spreading tourists wouldn&apos;t hurt...</p>
