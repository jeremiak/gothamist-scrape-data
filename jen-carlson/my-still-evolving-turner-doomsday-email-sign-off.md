<p>Ever since last Tuesday happened it has become impossible to think or talk or nightmare-dream about anything outside of the election results. On November 9th, without much thought, I started signing emails with: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117024624/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/796845560967753728">everything is awful</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>This is because it felt immediately wrong to send an email that wasn&apos;t about the election without somehow addressing the fact that we are all in deep trouble once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117024624/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald J. Trump</a> becomes President of the United States. IRL he&apos;s becoming The President! It&apos;s really happening. Everything is awful. So I felt the need to sign off with acknowledgement of that. It is my Turner Doomsday Email Sign-Off, if you will.</p>

<p>The Turner Doomsday Video is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117024624/http://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-video-cnn-will-play-when-the-world-ends-1677511538">the video</a> Ted Turner&apos;s Cable News Network had on file to play in the event the world was about to end. (Note to networks: don&apos;t have one of your own? Time may be running out! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117024624/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/trump_deport_2_million_people.php">CBS aired theirs last night</a>.) When Turner himself prepared the ultimate apocalyptic sign-off, he declared, &quot;We&apos;ll be on, and we will cover the end of the world, live, and that will be our last event. When the end of the world comes, we&apos;ll play &apos;Nearer My God To Thee&apos; before we sign off.&quot;</p>

<p>Turner never aired the video, and my email signature is being shelved for something more proactive, because that&apos;s what we need right now.</p>

<p>Everything might be less awful if you donate to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117024624/https://action.aclu.org/secure/protect-rights-freedoms-we-believe?s_src=UNW161102OVL&amp;alt_src=UNV161102OVL&amp;ms=web_161109_postelection_lightbox">the ACLU</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117024624/https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12913&amp;12913.donation=form1">Planned Parenthood</a>, </p>
