title: Video: The Bull Gets Dressed
---

<p>On Christmas Eve at 2 a.m., street artist Olek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110517121139/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/27/spotted_wall_street_bull_warms_up_w.php">adorned the Wall Street bull</a> in a custom knit... but sadly it only lasted about 2 hours. But now it will live on <em>forever</em>, and you can see how it was done, in this video:</p>

<p>Let&apos;s hope she gets all Christo with this idea and attempts some bigger city landmarks... the Statue of Liberty, perhaps?</p>
