</div></div>					<p>This year marks the 100th anniversary of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140423/http://gothamist.com/tags/bbg">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a>, and recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140423/http://theboweryboys.blogspot.com/2010/01/100-years-ago-brooklyn-botanic-garden.html">the Bowery Boys</a> took a look back at its history &#x2014; which begins with an ash dump. They recall: &quot;the Garden was created out of an ash dump, landscaped by the Olmsted Brothers (later of Fort Tryon fame), &apos;for the advancement and diffusion of a knowledge and love for plants.&apos; The garden&apos;s patron saint is most certainly Alfred Tredway White... an enlightened Brooklyn tenement owner and philanthropist who lobbied for and later helped fund the garden&apos;s creation and maintenance.&quot;</p>

<p>The Garden provides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140423/http://www.bbg.org/abo/history.html">a nice timeline</a> (with visuals) on their own site... it doesn&apos;t look like there were any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140423/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/28/brooklyn_botanic_garden_blooms.php">cherry blossoms</a> until 1941!</p>
