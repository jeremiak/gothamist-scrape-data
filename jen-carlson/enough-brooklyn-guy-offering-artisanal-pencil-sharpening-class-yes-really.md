										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="wtfpencilsharpening0112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805150717im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/wtfpencilsharpening0112.jpeg" width="250" height="341" class="image-right"> </span>Brooklyn, there was a line that was drawn, and you have stepped over it by offering up a course in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805150717/http://www.artisanalpencilsharpening.com/">ARTISANAL PENCIL SHARPENING</a>. Yeah, that is happening. David Rees&#x2014;who seems like a perfectly nice person and is also a political cartoonist for Rolling Stone and The Nation&#x2014;is bringing some Dixon Ticonderogas to Pete&apos;s Candy Store along with his knowledge in whittling the wooden sticks. His website declares:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;No, this is not a joke. You pay David Rees money and he sharpens your pencils. It actually happens. His artisanal service is perfect for artists, writers, and standardized test takers. For a mere $15, Mr. Rees will hand-sharpen your pencil to the most exacting standards, returning it to you together with the shavings, and a certificate of sharpening.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Here&apos;s a rundown of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805150717/http://warburtonlabs.blogspot.com/2010/07/lets-get-sharp.html">what to expect</a> from artisanal sharpeing services, because you probably have a lot of questions right about now. And while his services will cost you, the event&#x2014;held on February 13th&#x2014;is actually free, and part of his national tour. At press time, we still believe this is some weird performance art thing.
