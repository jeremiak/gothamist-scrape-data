title: Photos: 7 New Autumn Pastries From The Cronut Man
---

	
										<p>Dominique Ansel, King of the Cronut and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154230/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/ansel_magic_souffle_cronut.php">all things delicious</a>, introduced his new fall menu today, and it&apos;s too pretty to ignore. Click through for a look at the magical new items... all so delicate, like freshly fallen autumn leaves. The Chef tells us, &quot;Fall is my favorite time of year. The fruits tastes warm and comfortable, if that makes any sense. And the flavors bring out so many emotions and memories of family and friends and special occasions.&quot;<br>
