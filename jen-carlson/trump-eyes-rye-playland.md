<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="rye19321010.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102213855im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/rye19321010.jpg" width="300" height="243"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Rye Playland, 1932</span></i></div> Is Donald Trump keen on making Rye Playland his next undertaking? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102213855/http://www.lohud.com/article/201010170385">LoHud</a>, execs from his company dropped by this week to get briefed on Westchester County&apos;s bid to reinvent the 100-acre amusement park/landmark. <p></p>

<p>Trump isn&apos;t commenting, and Westchester County officials say his company was there alongside many others (including Live Nation); as of now, no official proposals have been made.</p>

<p>The 82-year-old park has been on a downward spiral for decades, and they&apos;re seeking &quot;visionary&quot; proposals to get it back on top of its game. New ideas are expected to be presented when proposals are due in February. Will The Donald try to change the name to Trump Playland?</p>
