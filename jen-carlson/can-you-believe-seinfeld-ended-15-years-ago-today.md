<p>&quot;The Finale&quot; brought together the entire cast, and all of the smaller players that appeared throughout the years&#x2014;co-creator Larry David even returned to write the script for the episode. Some loved it, some hated it, some are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914222011/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/09/18/ten_years_later_still_bitter_about_seinf"><em>still</em> bitter about it</a>. Gothamist wasn&apos;t even around back then to chime in, but the day after it aired <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914222011/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/15/arts/television-review-seinfeld-goes-out-in-self-referential-style.html">the NY Times</a> called it &quot;hilarious,&quot; and <em>Seinfeld</em> &quot;at its best: mordant, unsentimental... wildly self-referential and slightly surreal.&quot;</p>

<p>The last moments were viewed by 76.3 million people, and the episode is still the sixth most-watched entertainment event that ever hit the small screen. While the beloved show was branded as the show about &quot;nothing,&quot; at the moment it faded to black <em>Seinfeld</em> kind of started becoming a show about <em>something</em>&#x2014;how many times do <em>you</em> still reference it in your life?</p>
