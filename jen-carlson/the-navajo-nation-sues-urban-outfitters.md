<p>The Navajo Nation is the latest group to file a lawsuit against Urban Outfitters. The move comes months after the tribe sent a cease and desist to the retailer demanding they pull the &quot;Navajo&quot; name from products. As Sasha Houston Brown, a Native American activist, wrote in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831121648/http://www.racialicious.com/2011/10/10/an-open-letter-to-urban-outfitters-on-columbus-day/">her open letter</a> to the store last Columbus Day, they sell what she believes to be &quot;culturally offensive&quot; items, like plastic dreamcatchers, artificial feather jewelry, and hyper sexualized clothing with faux tribal patterns. Amongst the items that are a part of their &quot;Navajo collection&quot; flasks and hipster panties. </p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831121648/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46574519/ns/business-retail/#.T0_SInJWq-1">MSNBC reports</a> that a lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court, alleging &quot;trademark violations and violations of the federal Indian Arts and Crafts Act, which makes it illegal to sell arts or crafts in a way to falsely suggest they&apos;re made by American Indians when they&apos;re not.&quot; The suit states, &quot;The fame or reputation of the Navajo name and marks is such that, when defendant uses the &apos;Navajo&apos; and &apos;Navaho&apos; marks with its goods and services, a connection with the Navajo Nation is falsely presumed.&quot; Susan Scafidi of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University, as well as New York-based fashion lawyer Joseph F. Murphy Jr., told MSNBC that the trademark infringement is clear.</p>

<p>Most recently the retailer has managed to offend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831121648/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/29/st_patricks_day_crap_sold_at_urban.php">the Irish</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831121648/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/urban_outfitters_amongst_those_bein.php">parents</a>, and a number of designers who claimed the company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831121648/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/is_urban_outfitters_still_ripping_o.php">stole their ideas</a>. Do you think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831121648/http://gothamist.com/tags/dovcharney">Dov Charney</a>&apos;s new personal motto is, &quot;Thank God for Urban Outfitters&quot;?
