<p>Yesterday, just after the location of Banksy&apos;s new piece was discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923164854/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/07/photos_banksys_broken_heart_balloon.php#photo-1">in Red Hook</a>, people were complaining about graffiti writer Omar bombing it&#x2014;scribbling over the broken-hearted balloon and adding his tag next to it. A tipster who witnessed him sent us an email around 3 p.m.:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I went down to Red Hook and saw Banksy&apos;s piece this afternoon right before it got tagged over. I was &apos;interviewed&apos; by someone saying they were with the Daily News and had a long talk about Banksy and how I felt about covering up other peoples work. He apparently was just fronting and was an accomplice with OMAR, from conversations and photos I&apos;ve seen on instagram since it got tagged over.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Others Instagrammed their outrage, and unmasked him:</p>

<p>Adding layers or interesting contributions to the wall is expected and <em>perfectly fine</em>, but Omar is just spray painting the pieces in the most unoriginal way possible, in what appears to be a transparent fit of jealousy. &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923164854/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yZHveWFvqM&amp;oq=marsha%20ma&amp;gs_l=youtube..0.5j0l9.984532.986354.0.987826.9.9.0.0.0.0.193.949.4j5.9.0.eytns%2Cpt%3D-30%2Cn%3D2%2Cui%3Dlr.1.0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.eNHeuPLBG6g">Marcia Marcia Marcia</a>! Banksy Banksy Banksy!&quot; etc. Here he is at &quot;work&quot;: </p>

<p>Since he scribbled on the piece yesterday afternoon, someone has called Omar out by adding: &quot;is a jealous little girl&quot; under his name tag, and &quot;Omar is a punk&quot; off to the side.</p>
