<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061418/http://gothamist.com/tags/prince">Prince</a> left his mark on the music world not only through songs he performed himself, but those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061418/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/15-great-prince-songs-that-were-hits-for-other-artists-20160421/stevie-nicks-stand-back-1983-20160421#ixzz472NeEz65">he wrote for others</a>. One of the legendary musicians he collaborated with was Stevie Nicks, who shared some words about her &quot;amazing relationship&quot; with the Purple One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061418/http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/stevie-nicks-on-prince-my-heart-is-broken.html?mid=twitter_vulture">last night</a>, following a surprise appearance on Broadway&apos;s <em>School of Rock</em>. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I wrote &apos;Stand Back&apos; riding along in the car, the first time I heard &quot;Little Red Corvette.&apos; I had these words in my head, and I just started singing these words with a friend of mine. And I said, &apos;You know, we need to pull over and get a tape recorder because I need to record this.&apos; So I did, on a little tape recorder, and then I went in to record and I called him&#x2014;I got the number somehow&#x2014;to ask him if he would come over to Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, never in a million years expecting that he would say yes or that he was in Los Angeles. <br><br>He was there in 20 minutes and he played all the organ parts and he played, well, several things that I don&apos;t even really remember, but he played a lot on it. And he owns 50 percent of the song. We became really good friends from that moment onward because we had a&#x2014;you know, I didn&apos;t have to call and tell him that I kind of ripped off his song, but I did because I&apos;m honest. So it turned into a really amazing relationship. Is my heart broken? Absolutely. Broken.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Her story about how this all went down has slightly changed in its minor details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061418/http://www.inherownwords.com/standback.htm">over the years</a>, but it almost always ends with Prince disappearing into the night when his contributions were done: &quot;He just got up and left as if the whole thing happened in a dream,&quot; she once recalled.</p>

<p>The two also allegedly recorded a demo for (the unreleased song) &quot;All over You&quot;&#x2014;there is little information about this song, so maybe it&apos;s not... real? Stevie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061418/mailto:jencarlson@gothamist.com">please email us</a>.</p>

<p>In 2009, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061418/http://www.mtv.com/news/1608437/stevie-nicks-wants-to-work-with-timbaland-opens-up-about-collaborating-with-prince/">she shared </a>another (and lesser known) Prince anecdote, this time it was about what would become one of Prince&apos;s own famous songs: </p><blockquote>&#x201C;Prince and I became really good friends,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;and he actually gave me a cassette, and said, &#x2019;There&#x2019;s a song on it, and I would like you to write it.&#x2019; I take it home and put it on, and I&#x2019;m listening to this like amazing song &#x2026; and it&#x2019;s &#x2019;Purple Rain&#x2019;! And I&#x2019;m like, I can&#x2019;t write a song to this! It [wasn&#x2019;t] &#x2019;Purple Rain&#x2019; yet, but it [was] the track that became &#x2019;Purple Rain.&#x2019;&#x201D;</blockquote>Sadly, Stevie is one of the only musicians who <em>hasn&apos;t</em> covered this song in the past week, but she did gift us with one of her own last night:<p></p>
