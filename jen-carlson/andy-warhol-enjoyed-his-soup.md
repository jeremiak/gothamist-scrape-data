<p>William MacFarland was a product marketing manager for Campbell&apos;s at the time Andy Warhol turned their soup cans into a now-iconic work of art. In 1964, MacFarland took pen to paper to write <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001618/http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/07/i-hear-you-like-tomato-soup.html">this letter</a> to the artist (full transcript below)&#x2014;sent to 1342 Lexington Avenue, site of the first Factory. In it Warhol is told that MacFarland wishes he could afford one of his paintings, and then informs him that, &quot;I have learned that you like Tomato Soup. I am taking the liberty of having a couple of cases of our Tomato Soup delivered to you at this address.&quot; Wonder if Warhol repaid him with a painting...
