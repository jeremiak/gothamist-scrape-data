title: Delivery Hack: You Can Search Seamless For Calorie Counts
---

	
										<p>Did you know that some restaurants provide calorie counts on Seamless, and you can find them easily? Welcome to HELLthier living. We just noticed one restaurant in our delivery area provided the information, and thought we&apos;d share this tip. But possibly of more importance: <em>why do baked sweet potato fries have so many calories?</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="NEWSEAMLESS14.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135125im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/NEWSEAMLESS14.jpg" width="640" height="429" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In order to find out which restaurants provide this service in your delivery area, all you need to do is type in &quot;calories&quot; in the food item search box (on the top, left hand side of the screen). The service may ruin your indulgent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135125/http://gothamist.com/tags/hangoverfood">hangover breakfast</a> orders, but if used properly it can also stop you from ordering those zucchini sticks <em>which are not a healthy vegetable side</em>. </p>

<p>We reached out to Seamless to find out just how many restaurants in NYC provide this service, and if they&apos;ll ever make it mandatory. We&apos;ll update when we hear back.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Seamless was of little help, telling us, &quot;We don&apos;t have that number available. As well, we don&apos;t speculate as to what features we will or will not eventually incorporate into our services.&quot;</p>
