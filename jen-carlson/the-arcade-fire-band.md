To those who are lucky enough to hold tickets to tomorrow nights show at Bowery, hold on to them...no matter how much you are offered. </p>

<p>Their album, <i>Funeral</i>, was made around the time several of the bands family members passed away. It&apos;s an operatic, orchestral homage to everything in life that is mourned, celebrated and otherwise experienced. Our personal #1 album of the year. And seeing them live, you are drawn into their world as the band transforms any venue into a makeshift church of sorts, everyone moving to the dramatic optimism and cascading sound; preaching a common gospel.</p>

<p>We saw this much buzzed about troupe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214202525/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/10/14/cmj_review_night_one_starring_the_arcade_fire.php">during CMJ</a>. The energy hovered above in the air even before the band took the stage, and with the first hit of a tambourine and the first drumstick being whacked against an inanimate object&#x2014;the room exploded. The Arcade Fire is a kind of magic that we had not witnessed before. We hope it does not dissipate as they become &quot;bigger,&quot; and we have a feeling it will only transform into something not yet describable. </p>

<p>Believe the hype. </p>

<p><b>The Arcade Fire</b> are <b>Win Butler</b>, <b>Regine Chassagne</b>, <b>Richard Parry</b>, <b>Tim Kingsbury</b>, <b>Sarah Neufeld</b>, <b>Jeremy Garaand</b> and Win&apos;s little brother <b>Will</b>. They all play a lot of instruments. </p>

<p>Win took some time out at a local library, just after CMJ, to answer some of our questions...</p>

<p><b>Let me start off by just saying that I first saw you guys about a week ago at Mercury Lounge and was immediately among one of the converted in the audience. You gained a lot of fans that night, a lot of excited music lovers who were waiting with bated breath for something new, and a lot of digital ink praised you on blogs the next day. At that show you introduced yourselves as the flavor of the month. Is that how you see yourselves? Do you feel pressure now to live up to the hype?</b><br>
That was more of a joke...Of course we have liked our band for a lot longer than a month, but people are pretty cynical about music these days...We just spent 2 hours chopping wood yesterday...what pressure, what hype?</p>

<p><b>You thanked the internet in a NY Times article, and bloggers have been mentioned in articles about you. Since we&apos;re a website we found this pretty interesting. Do you think blogs are pertinent in getting the buzz started about bands? Do you read any in particular?</b><br>
I was kind of joking about thanking the internet as well, but I do think that people are very influenced by what other people think, and passionate blog writers get some people stirred up!<br>
 <br>
<b>Do you find it hard to channel the energy you have during your live show in a studio?</b><br>
 The studio has a very different energy and the goal is totally different...there is no way to just bash around in the studio the same as the live show and have it come across...live energy does a lot to distract people from blemishes! I have never been a fan of bands who sound the same live as in the studio...</p>
