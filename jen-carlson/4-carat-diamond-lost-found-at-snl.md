It was found by staging director Tom Popple, who told the couple, &quot;I&apos;m holding it in my hand as we speak.&quot; The couple had called from Nobu 57, where they went to dine afterwards&#x2014;aw, rich people. The woman says, &quot;It&apos;s one of my favorite things. I wake up in cold sweats dreaming that I&apos;m going to lose my ring&#x2014;and the funny thing is, I did.&quot; Hilarious! Maybe it&apos;ll make it into a sketch this weekend.</p>
