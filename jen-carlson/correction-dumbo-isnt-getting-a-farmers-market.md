                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="farmersentrance.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823021223im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/farmersentrance.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span><br>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="veggiesdumbo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823021223im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/veggiesdumbo.jpg" width="350" height="320"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> (Gothamist)</i></div> <strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> A couple of weeks ago we spotted some handwritten signs at the opening of an alley that leads to a courtyard on Plymouth Street in DUMBO, they said &quot;Farmer&apos;s Market.&quot; We figured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823021223/http://instagram.com/p/bmHerUvYYm/">it was a trap</a>, or a set for one of the many movies filmed in the neighborhood. But today we found out IT&apos;S REAL&#x2014;one of the organizers told us that from today onward it will be happening every Wednesday, from 5 to 8 p.m.<p></p>

<p>The news is welcome, as DUMBO is a bit of a food desert with Peas &amp; Pickles and Bridge Fresh as the only options of fresh-<em>ISH</em> produce (unless you want to pay triple at Forager&apos;s&#x2014;$6.99 for a 1/2 cup of blueberries today!). </p>

<p>Precious little is known about the mysterious Farmer&apos;s Market, which has popped up out of nowhere&#x2014;when we returned with more questions and a better camera, the organizers were deep behind the locked gate, unavailable. But we&apos;ll update when we find out more.</p>

<p>The market is located on Plymouth Street, between Pearl and Jay streets.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> Despite what the guy working there earlier told us (&quot;yes, it&apos;s a Farmer&apos;s Market&quot;), and despite the &quot;Farmer&apos;s Market&quot; sign... a woman working there now tells us it&apos;s just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823021223/http://www.dumbocsa.org/www.sangleefarms.com/www.briermere.com/www.sangleefarms.com/">a CSA</a>! Here&apos;s a photo of the sign as it looks now:</p>

<p>Anyway, someone bring a farmer&apos;s market to DUMBO please.</p>
