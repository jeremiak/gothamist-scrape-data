</div></div>					<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160411213520/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/">Nathan Kensinger</a> is an urban explorer, filmmaker, location scout and photographer. Illegally accessing  areas that normal folks don&apos;t usually see, his photos give everyone a glimpse at what&apos;s inside the restricted areas. His work has landed in the Brooklyn Museum and Library in the past, and now he has a new show about to open at Union Docs called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160411213520/http://uniondocs.org/blog/abandoned-brooklyn">Abandoned Brookyn</a>,&quot; which shows &quot;the rapid pace of development along the waterfront has been reshaping many old industrial neighborhoods&quot; in the borough.</em></p>

<p><strong>Is your main focus photographing parts of New York that many don&apos;t see?</strong> Over the past five years, the main focus of my photography has been exploring and documenting the edges of New York City - the industrial neighborhoods, the waterfronts, the freight lines, the abandoned buildings.  Many of the places I visit are off limits to the general public. So, yes, as a documentary filmmaker and a photographer I like to report back from places that most people don&apos;t get a chance to see.</p>

<p><strong>What has been one of your more memorable photography adventures?</strong> Wow - I&apos;ve got to think of a story I can tell without getting into too much trouble! All the abandoned industrial buildings I visit are adventures, with crazy discoveries and close escapes.  The most memorable ones are the places where you are walking up the steps or towards a closed door, and you don&apos;t know what to expect ahead of you. It could be just another empty room, another hallway.  It could be something really unpleasant.  But suddenly you are out on a balcony in the turbine hall of a 15-story powerhouse, or you are standing in molasses inside the stadium-sized dome of a sugar refinery. Those places can take your breath away - you have to stand there for a minute, thinking &quot;what did I just find?!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Is there somewhere you haven&apos;t been able to photograph yet that you would like to?</strong> In New York, I&apos;d like to do a series of photos of the Con Edison power plants that line the East River.  They are such a formidable part of the landscape, but few people ever get to see what goes on behind the fences and walls that surround them.  I&apos;m trying to find the right person to get permission from - because you&apos;d definitely need permission to visit them!</p>
