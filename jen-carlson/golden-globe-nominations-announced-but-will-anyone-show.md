They were announcing this year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150343/http://www.goldenglobes.org/news/id/81">Golden Globe nominees</a>, often a good sign for who will be nominated for that <em>other</em> gold statue. All in all New York-based shows and movies fared well as the <strike>envelopes were opened</strike> sheets of paper were read from.</p>

<ul>
<li>30 Rock (Best Television Series, Comedy or Musical -- Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey were also nominated for their roles)
</li><li>Damages (Best Television Series, Drama -- Glenn Close and Ted Danson were also nominated for their roles)
</li><li>Mad Men (Best Television Series, Drama)
</li><li>Enchanted (Amy Adams was nominated for her role)
</li><li>Michael Clayton (Best Motion Picture, Drama -- George Clooney and Tilda Swinton were also nominated for his role)
</li><li>American Gangster (Best Motion Picture, Drama -- Denzel Washington was nominated for his role, Ridley Scott was nominated for his direction)
</li><li>Across the Universe (Best Motion Picture, Comedy or Musical)
</li></ul>
The big motion picture nominees were Atonement, Charlie Wilson&apos;s War, No Country for Old Men and Michael Clayton, while the big TV nominees were Damages, Longford, 30 Rock and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (which was produced by Law &amp; Order producer Dick Wolf).  We reserve huhs for nominating Californication as Best TV Comedy and David Duchovny for Best Actor TV, but we supposed the Hollywood Foreign Press really loved The X-Files.  

<p>One concern is that if the writers&apos; strike continues, the awards ceremony (set for January 13th) may be a little empty.  In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150343/http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117977536.html?nav=news&amp;categoryid=1983&amp;cs=1">producers are concerned</a> the entire awards season may be lackluster and devoid of star power as actors join the writers in solidarity.  It&apos;s unclear if actors&apos; contracts include clauses that require them to appear at awards shows, but we bet studios will think about putting them in!<br>
