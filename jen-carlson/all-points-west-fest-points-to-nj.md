Now we learn the proper name, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141124/http://www.apwfestival.com/">All Points West</a>, and some more details from the press release:</p><blockquote>The three-day event is set for August 8, 9 and 10, 2008 at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141124/http://www.libertystatepark.com/">Liberty State Park</a> in New Jersey.  This historic location offers panoramic views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the Manhattan skyline.  The festival&#x2019;s name is inspired by the area&#x2019;s rich history, particularly Ellis Island and the NJ Central Railroad terminal located on the festival site, where people boarded trains for All Points West.</blockquote>First thought: the dates match up exactly with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141124/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/29/south_jersey_ro.php">the Vineland concert</a>, putting the two in direct competition. The organizers promise more details about ticket info and lineup in the coming weeks, though Paul Tollett (one organizer involved) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141124/http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6306/news/music/official_coachella_08_lineup_announced_all_points_west_confirmed">mentioned</a> that &quot;Radiohead played there in 2001 and there hasn&apos;t been a music event there since.&quot; Is that a hint Paul? Time will tell, and in the interim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141124/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/ledger/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-1/1200980132327620.xml&amp;coll=1">NJ.com</a> says they anticipate crowds as large as 30,000 per day (about half the amount Coachella now sees). It&apos;s also important to note there will be no camping, so concert-goers will have to come and go each day. Will you make the trip to Jerz? <p></p>
