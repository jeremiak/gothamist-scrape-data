										<p>It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170312/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/18/will_franco_make_a_good_ginsberg.php">almost a year</a> since we got our first glimpse of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170312/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> playing Alan Ginsberg in his upcoming movie, <em>Howl</em>. And now, after being forced to get our Franco-fix through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170312/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/05/james_franco_arrives.php"><em>daytime television</em></a>... here are some clips from the film (which hits the big screen tomorrow). Bonus: Don Draper!</p>

<p>Double bonus?: Did you see Franco, his Japanese body pillow named Komiko and Liz Lemon have a threesome on <em>30 Rock</em> last week? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170312/http://www.hulu.com/watch/119676/30-rock-black-light-attack">Video</a>!</p>
