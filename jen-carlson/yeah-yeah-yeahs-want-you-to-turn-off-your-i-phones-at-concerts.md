PUT THAT AWAY as a courtesy to the person behind you and to Nick, Karen and Brian. MUCH LOVE AND MANY THANKS! YEAH YEAH YEAHS.&quot;<p></p>

<p><em>But if you don&apos;t Instagram everything, how will your friends be jealous of your life?</em> Karen O did make one allowance, enforcing the rule <em>after</em> two songs had been performed. Following that, she demanded that fans pocket their iPhones. We applaud the effort, but what if this type of law enforcement by bands doesn&apos;t work... might we recommend <em>a venue jail?</em> At Lollapalooza &apos;94, organizers had a &quot;jail&quot; set up for certain bad behaviors (like crowd surfing)... maybe venues should consider this for those who hold their phones up during shows. Because it&apos;s only going to get worse...</p>

<p>A few years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142819/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/24/are_cameraphones_killing_concerts.php">we asked if cameraphones were killing concerts</a>, and 66% answered &quot;yes&quot; in our poll. Now with Instagram, Vine, and other social media platforms encouraging the practice&#x2014;and people photographing shows with their gigantic iPads (you are The Worst!)&#x2014;we&apos;re guessing that number will only continue to rise as those who want to enjoy life <em>in the moment</em> become even more outnumbered.</p>
