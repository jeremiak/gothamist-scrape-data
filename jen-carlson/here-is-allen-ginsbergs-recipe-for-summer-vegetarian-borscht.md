<p>What did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109023659/http://gothamist.com/tags/AllenGinsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> cook up while sweating the days away in his apartment during hot New York City summers? A meal he deemed &quot;Suitable for Summer Dinner&quot;: a cold borscht. His recipe has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109023659/http://www.openculture.com/2013/06/allen_ginsbergs_recipe_for_a_cold_summer_borscht.html">passed around</a> recently, and thanks to that, you can make it on your own this summer:</p>

<p><strong>COLD SUMMER BORSCHT</strong></p>

<p>Dozen beets cleaned &amp; chopped to bite size salad-size strips. Stems &amp; leaves also chopped like salad lettuce. All boiled together lightly salted to make a bright red soup, with beets now soft&#x2014;boil an hour or more. Add Sugar &amp; Lemon Juice to make the red liquid sweet &amp; sour like lemonade. Chill 4 gallon(s) of beet liquid, serve with sour cream on table.</p>

<ul><li>(2) Boiled small or halved potato on the side (i.e. so hot potatoes don&#x2019;t heat the cold soup prematurely)
</li><li>(3) Spring salad on table to put into cold red liquid
</li><li>(1) Onions - sliced (spring onions)
</li><li>(2) Tomatoes - sliced bite-sized
</li><li>(3) Lettuce - ditto
</li><li>(4) Cucumbers - ditto
</li><li>(5) a few radishes</li></ul>

<p>And in the man&apos;s own handwriting:</p>

<p>It seems Ginsberg was a big soup man, and weeks before he died he had made fish chowder for some friends, which was discovered in his apartment after his death&#x2014;in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109023659/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/03/19/010319ta_TALK_DEPT_OF_IMMORTAL">this <em>New Yorker</em> piece</a> from 2001, it says &quot;about the only trace of Ginsberg remaining on East Thirteenth Street was the leftover fish chowder.&quot; At the time, the loft that housed the Allen Ginsberg Trust still contained two jars of the soup in the freezer&#x2014;&quot;Bob Rosenthal, Ginsberg&apos;s secretary, says that he felt pangs of grief tossing out the poet&apos;s dried beans and stale kasha, and just could not bring himself to throw out the soup.&quot; [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109023659/http://dangerousminds.net/comments/allen_ginsbergs_recipe_for_cold_summer_borscht">Dangerous Minds</a> via <a href="www.openculture.com/2013/06/allen_ginsbergs_recipe_for_a_cold_summer_borscht.html">Open Culture</a>]</p>
