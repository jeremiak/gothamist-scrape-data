title: Bring the Noise: Unsilent Night is Tonight!

<p><img alt="200712boombox.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015952im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200712boombox.jpg" width="240" height="180" class="right">Artist Phil Kline has brought us an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015952/http://unsilentnight.com/">Unsilent Night</a> every year since 1992. He describes his experiment as an &quot;outdoor ambient music piece for an infinite number of boomboxes. It&#x2019;s like a Christmas caroling party except that we don&#x2019;t sing, but rather carry the music, each of us playing a separate track that is a voice in the piece.&quot;</p>

<p>City blocks are usually loud enough, but tonight get ready for a full-on sound symphony to take over parts of New York. The event begins in Washington Square Park and ends in Tompkins Square Park. Wanna join? Bring a cassette/cd/mp3 and a good &apos;ol fashioned boombox, or anything that will blast your tunes. The organizers say &quot;cassettes sound the coolest, but we realize cassette players are getting scarce now.&quot; </p>

<p>Expect thousands of people, hundreds of boomboxes and a sound cacophony that&apos;ll give you goosebumps (and not just because it&apos;s so cold out there). Be a part of the sonic parade and meet at the Arch at Washington Square Park at 6:45pm (expect to arrive in Tompkins Square Park around 8pm). </p>
