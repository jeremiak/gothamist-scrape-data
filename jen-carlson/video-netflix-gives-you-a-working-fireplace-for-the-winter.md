<p>Are all of your favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112211746/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/where_to_find_the_best_fireplace_ba.php">fireplace bars</a> closed for Christmas? Good news, it won&apos;t keep your warm, but Netflix just added a fireplace to their Instant Watch option. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112211746/http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Fireplace_for_Your_Home/70222873?trkid=3777158">A Fireplace For Your Home</a> features two versions, a &quot;crackling fireplace&quot; (self explanatory) and a &quot;yule log fireplace,&quot; which plays Christmas songs along with the crackling sounds&#x2014;you&apos;ve probably seen it on at your grandma&apos;s house every Christmas. Each version is about 60 minutes long. </p>

Really! And if you don&apos;t have Netflix <em>or</em> a non-functional fireplace, YouTube has got you covered:</p>
