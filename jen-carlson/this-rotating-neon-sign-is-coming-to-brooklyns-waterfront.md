<p>A new text sculpture is being installed a a few piers from Deborah Kass&apos;s bright yellow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605062500/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/10/new_sculpture_shouts_oy_at_manhatta.php">OY/YO piece</a> at Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s Main Street lawn. On May 4th, Martin Creed&apos;s massive neon &quot;Understanding&quot; sign will be unveiled at Pier 6, the Public Art Fund <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605062500/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/press/public-art-fund-announces-martin-creeds-new-neon-sculpture-for-brooklyn-bridge-park-bringing-message-of-understanding-to-nyc-this-spring">has announced</a>. </p>

<p>The steel piece is 25-feet-tall and is described as a &quot;rotating ruby red neon sculpture&quot; that will radiate over the Park&apos;s southernmost pier and the East River, making it visible from Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge, as well. From the Public Art Fund:</p>

<blockquote>The beam will spin at varying speeds, sometimes moving slowly and other times at a faster pace; the rhythm will be determined by a computerized program designed by Creed. The post stands in the center of a stepped base reminiscent of a ziggurat that will act as seating for park visitors. From Pier 6, the work will be highly visible&#x2014;a luminous sign with a clear and poignant message&#x2014;while visually interacting with the City&#x2019;s well-known skyline.</blockquote> 

<p>The sculpture&#x2014;Creed&apos;s largest to date&#x2014;will be on view through October 23rd, 2016, partially coinciding with his exhibit at the Park Avenue Armory, which will run from June 8th through August 7th.</p>
