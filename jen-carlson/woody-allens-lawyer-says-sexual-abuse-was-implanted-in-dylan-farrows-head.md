										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sm2114woody.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sm2114woody.jpg" width="350" height="263" class="image-right"> </span>There is continuing fallout and rancorous debate surrounding Dylan Farrow&apos;s open letter published in the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/dylan_farrow_writes_open_letter_abo.php">this weekend</a>, in which she addressed the allegation that Woody Allen sexually abused her when she was a child. Farrow&apos;s letter&#x2014;which gut-wrenchingly began: &quot;When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic... then he sexually assaulted me&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/03/dylan_farrow_woody_allen.php">has elicited an outpouring of support</a>, some criticism, and a few raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>As for Allen&apos;s defenders, most seem to be in agreement with the lawyer on his payroll, believing Mia Farrow planted stories in Dylan&apos;s head as a child, at the height of their acrimonious custody battle. On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/http://www.today.com/video/today/54267829#54267829">the Today Show</a>, Allen&apos;s lawyer Elkan Abramowitz said he thinks Dylan &quot;truly believes this happened. When you implant a story in a fragile 7 year old&apos;s mind, it stays there... it never goes away.&quot;</p>

<p>He also spoke out on behalf of his client, saying his &quot;reaction is one of overwhelming sadness because of what has happened to Dylan. She was a pawn in a huge fight between him and Mia Farrow years ago, and the idea that she was molested was implanted in her by her mother. And that memory is never going to go away. So the fact that she says this now, that it happened 20 years ago, is totally understandable.&quot; However, he later goes on to say, &quot;The case is over, there is no case. The fact that&apos;s it&apos;s being brought up now is suspect. All of a sudden we&apos;re seeing these allegations surface again and one has to wonder why.&quot; He believes the resurfaced allegations are &quot;a continuation of Mia Farrow&apos;s desire to hurt Woody Allen. He&apos;s riding fairly high... he got the Golden Globes award for lifetime achievement and I believe it revived the anger she has towards him.&quot;</p>

<p>This all echoes what Allen said when the allegations first came up in 1993. At the time, he was interviewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/hamill-dylan-child-molestation-claims-woody-allen-planted-article-1.1601295">by Denis Hamill</a>, who says he still believes Allen. Here is what the director told Hamill back then: &quot;In the past eight months, I haven&apos;t seen Dylan once, and I have spent a grand total of 36 hours with Satchel, my biological son... you have to brush past the things he says. Things like, &apos;I&apos;m supposed to say I hate you.&apos; And, &apos;Mommy is writing a book that she says will make you go away forever.&apos; Or, &apos;I wish you were dead.&apos; He would say these things but not act them. It was as if he were obliged to say them.&quot;</p>

<p>From an even more outsider perspective, Barbara Walters and Sherri Shepherd had a heated discussion over the open letter on The View, with Walters defending Allen, and Shepherd bringing up his history with young girls (NY Mag has that history <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/woody-allen-and-young-girls-a-history.html">right here</a>).</p>

<p>And lastly, Stephen King <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/http://www.salon.com/2014/02/04/stephen_king_on_dylan_farrows_open_letter_theres_an_element_of_palpable_bitchery_there/">also spoke up</a> about it, for some reason, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/430468906243735552">Tweeting</a> &quot;there&#x2019;s an element of palpable bitchery&quot; in Dylan&apos;s letter. After criticisms, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/430515420836024320">he Tweeted</a>, &quot;Have no opinion on the accusations; hope they&apos;re not true. Probably used the wrong word.&quot; Perhaps he should have followed Alec Baldwin&apos;s lead&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174733/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/03/dylan_farrow_woody_allen.php">the actor said</a>, &quot;You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me in this family&apos;s issue.&quot;</p>
