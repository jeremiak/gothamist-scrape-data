And a very special thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222807/http://maningray.com/">all</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222807/http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/">of</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222807/http://ghostlandobservatory.com/">the</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222807/http://the-fame.com/">bands</a>. And did we mention that David Bowie even showed up?! Which, actually, we knew was going to happen, as he needed a reserved seat and list spots. Once he arrived he sat upstairs in the balcony with a baseball hat on and stayed through Clap Your Hands Say Yeah&apos;s set.<p></p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next Hype, which will hopefully be taking place in August/September. In the meantime, we feel it&apos;s our duty to tell you that you MUST see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516222807/http://www.ghostlandobservatory.com/">Ghostland Observatory</a> (pictured at last night&apos;s show) again (or for the first time) while they&apos;re still in town this week. These guys are so amazing and we&apos;re pretty sure we kept hugging them and telling them so last night.  </p>
