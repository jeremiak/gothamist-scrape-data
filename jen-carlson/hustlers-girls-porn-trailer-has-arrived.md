<p>The porn industry isn&apos;t really known for its accurate portrayal of anything, including how real people actually have sex. So you can attach a theme to a title, or a parody title to a movie, and you&apos;ll still pretty much end up with the same end result: a dizzying montage of sex, screams, and terrible dialogue. And with that gentle reminder that the porn industry never really changed, despite the brief hope of Jerry Gerard, we give you Hustler&apos;s <em>Girls</em> trailer (hosted over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175503/http://straight.fleshbot.com/5980276/hustler-unleashes-this-aint-girls-xxx-on-the-world">at Fleshbot</a>&#x2014;do we need to tell you it&apos;s NSFWXXXXXXX?).</p>

<p>There is a girl named Hannah, lesbian sex, straight sex, blowjobs, and just about 10% more nudity than you&apos;ll see in the real show. But in the end (not a porn pun), Lena Dunham captured a <em>Girls</em> porn parody better <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175503/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/09/lena_dunham_email.php">in that one photo she took</a> before she even created the show.</p>

<p>So, are YOU a bored young creative in Brooklyn? Get a Kickstarter and do this thing right, you are welcome to any of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175503/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/theres_now_a_porn_version_of_girls.php">our title ideas</a>: Hannah Horvath Does Greenpoint, Lena Done Him, Zosia Slammed It, Adam Drive-her, The Penetration Of A Generation, and Cafe Bumpy).</p>
