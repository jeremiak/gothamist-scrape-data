<p>National Banana Split Day is coming up on Saturday, the 25th, which means there are only four more banana shopping days left! But if you feel like celebrating the holiday in style out on the town, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619095048/http://www.carminesnyc.com/">Carmine&apos;s Italian restaurant</a> has created a gigantic banana split that can serve up to 10 people. It&apos;s called The Titanic, and it costs a pretty reasonable $25. They tell us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Years ago, a Carmine&#x2019;s waiter came up with The Titanic as a response to a table that asked for &#x201C;one of everything.&#x201D; The result is a massive banana split that features six scoops of ice cream, hot fudge, strawberries , whipped cream, roasted hazelnuts, two caramelized bananas and, as if that weren&#x2019;t enough, an entire chocolate torta as its base.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>That&apos;s it pictured above... doesn&apos;t it look like they tried to make it look like the ship that tragically sank, with pirouette cookie as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619095048/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_(ship)">ship&apos;s funnels</a>? BYO Jack and Rose dolls so you can play with your food.</p>
