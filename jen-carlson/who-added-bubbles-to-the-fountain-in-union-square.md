<p>At some point this morning someone with a sense of humor added bubbles to the fountain in Union Square. Reader Tim N. tells us he didn&apos;t spot any promotional signage or bubble vandals around when he passed by on his way to work, so who&apos;s responsible for the suds remains a mystery. People seem to be having fun with it, however&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508160928/http://instagr.am/p/LQZB8zH-g8/">Bond No. 9</a> just posted the below photo on Instagram, noting: &quot;The bubbles are flowing in Union Square! Two guys turned the fountain into a bubble bath and are dancing in it... something tells us Andy Warhol would love this&quot;... and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508160928/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKN1T3K1idg">so would Fellini</a>. </p>
