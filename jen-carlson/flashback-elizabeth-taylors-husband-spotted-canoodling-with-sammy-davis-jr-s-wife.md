<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213025/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/actress_elizabeth_taylor_dead_at_79.php">Elizabeth Taylor</a> died at the age of 79, and since then plenty of stories and images have resurfaced. Here is the actress pictured in New York City in 1964&#x2014;with her are Sammy Davis Jr., his wife May Britt, and Richard Burton. Burton was her 5th husband, whom she married that year... though it&apos;s unclear if the wedding took place before or after he made the moves on another woman!</p>
