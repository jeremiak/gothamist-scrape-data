title: Video: Liam Neeson Would Live in NYC's Horse Stables
---

	
										<p>Last night Liam Neeson appeared on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074559/http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=216562&amp;title=liam-neeson">the Daily Show</a> and <em>he swears</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074559/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/19/liam_neeson_hates_horses.php">carriage horses</a> are treated like kings in New York, in fact, he&apos;d even live in their stables himself! After some back and forth about the topic, Jon Stewart compromised with the actor, saying that if they could build a horse-friendly space in a meadow in Central Park it might be okay. Neeson says horses don&apos;t like the freedom of running in fields, however, and declared: &quot;Everyone thinks cows in the fields would rather be running wild&#x2014;that&apos;s bullsh**, horses don&apos;t either.&quot;</p>

<p>In the above clip you&apos;ll hear Stewart tell him: &quot;I don&apos;t think living on 52nd and 11th is a holiday for a horse.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074559/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/01/liam_neeson_un-.php?c=pflnhd09">PETA responded</a> to Neeson as well, saying the comments on the show has them &quot;wondering if one of his horses might have kicked him in the head.&quot;</p>
