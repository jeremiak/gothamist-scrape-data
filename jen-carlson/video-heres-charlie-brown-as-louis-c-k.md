<p>What if Charlie Brown grew up, moved to &quot;the big city,&quot; became an animated version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204443/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a>, and finally told Lucy to &quot;fuck off&quot;? Below you can see the Peanuts Gang all grown up&#x2014;which basically means they&apos;re depressed, suicidal, hoarding cats, and battling STDs. It sounds depressing, but your brain, heart, and soul <strike>want</strike> <em>need</em> to see what <em>Charlie C.K.</em> would be like. Below: &quot;Charlie goes back to his hometown. Finds out his dog Snoopy is dead. Buys a motorcycle.&quot;</p>
