<p>What were deep-pocketed Wall Streeters eating in between bumps in the 1980s? Find out next month when Williamsburg&apos;s Nitehawk Cinemas offers their interpretation of stuffy &quot;nouveau haute cuisine&quot; at their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011023500/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/movie/american-psycho/">screening of <em>American Psycho</em></a>.</p>

<p>The Bret Easton Ellis movie will be paired with a six course menu by Chef Francis Derby (King, Shorty&#x2019;s .32, Momofuku Ssam Bar, Tailor, wd-50) that pays homage to the decade&apos;s Wall Street boom, and is enough to fill the empty soul of one Patrick Bateman himself. </p>

<p>The menu includes: Squid ravioli and lemongrass broth; Goat Cheese Profiteroles; &#x201C;Arugula Caesar;&#x201D; Peanut Butter Soup, Smoked duck, Mashed Squash; Sea Urchin Ceviche; Cilantro Crawfish Gumbo; Hanger Steak, B&#xE9;arnaise, Potato Pave; and Chocolate Parfait. All that for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011023500/http://348.formovietickets.com/Tickets.ASP?WCI=buyticket&amp;Page=PickTickets&amp;SHOWID=274">a very reasonable $75</a>. And that&apos;s about as close as you&apos;ll get to an <em>American Psycho</em>-themed dinner, as the movie&apos;s restaurants (Dorsia, Barcadia, Pastels, Crayons) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011023500/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=4259">never actually existed</a> off the screen.</p>

<p>The event is on February 7th (7:45 p.m.), and don&apos;t forget to bring your business cards (the ones with a subtle off-white coloring and tasteful thickness).</p>
