										<p>&quot;Mom, are we going to be on The Internet?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I told you son, there&apos;s more to life than having your photo make the rounds on Twitter or getting tossed into a massive listicle on Buzzfeed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162120/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/red_panda_cubs.php">the red pandas</a>...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We aren&apos;t like the red pandas, son. We just aren&apos;t. And we have to be okay with that. But remember: we&apos;re miniature Zebus, and that&apos;s pretty special.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But &apos;Oldest and Smallest Breeds of Cattle&apos; wouldn&apos;t be a good listicle, right mom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s right son, no one would click on that headline. Absolutely no one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mom, they&apos;re taking our picture! Try to look more viral!&quot;</p>

These two miniature zebus (a male and female) are now a part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162120/http://www.prospectparkzoo.com/">Prospect Park Zoo</a>&apos;s barn (which also features sheep, goats, turkeys, a variety of chickens and geese, miniature horses, and other domestic animals). They have small horns on top of their heads, and they&apos;ll probably never go viral on the internet.</p>
