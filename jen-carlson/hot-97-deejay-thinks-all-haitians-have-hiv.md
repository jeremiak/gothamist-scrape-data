During his Friday morning show last week, the deejay told listeners, &quot;The reason I&apos;m HIV negative is because I don&apos;t mess with Haitian girls.&quot; So, yeah, the Haitian community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151217/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/12/20/2010-12-20_hot_97_dj_cipha_sounds_apologizes_after_saying_he_avoids_hiv_by_not_hooking_up_w.html">is <em>not</em> happy</a>, and now they, as well as local leaders, are calling for him to be fired.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old, whose real name is Luis Diaz, apologized after the station started getting calls&#x2014;the full video is below, where he says: &quot;I made a stupid, tasteless joke that was a one-liner that was taken totally the wrong way. I want to say sincerely that I apologize.&quot; How would that comment be taken the <em>right</em> way?</p>

<p>For now Diaz still has his job, but a coalition of Haitian community leaders are planning a rally outside of the Hot 97 headquarters on Hudson Street tomorrow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151217/http://365voice.com/hot-97-radio-personality-cipha-sounds-gets-haitian-community-riled-up/">at 11 a.m.</a></p>
