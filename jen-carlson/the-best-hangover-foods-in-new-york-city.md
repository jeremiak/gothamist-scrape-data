title: The Best Hangover Foods In New York City
---

	
										<p><em>When suffering through hangovers in college, I would sometimes manage to lift my eyelids before the sun set, make it out of my bed, and get into a chair at my friend&apos;s family restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://www.louisrestaurant.org/">Louis</a>. Once there, someone in the Gianfrancesco family would cook me up the largest, most perfect egg and cheese sandwich<strong>*</strong>, served on a 6&quot; or 12&quot; roll (possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://www.louisrestaurant.org/Photo-Album.html">with home fries on top</a>). Greasy spoon diner food&#x2014;ideally served alongside a hot cup of coffee in one of those thick, nondescript white mugs&#x2014;sates hangover cravings like nothing else can. But since I can&apos;t walk to Providence from here, I&apos;ve been forced to seek out other culinary cures. Below, in honor of the biggest hangover day of the year&#x2014;New Year&apos;s Day&#x2014;is a tested and fine-tuned list from our editors on where to get the best hangover dishes in New York City&#x2014;keep in mind this is NOT BRUNCH, but rather a quick, easy pick-me-up in a place where you&apos;ll find little to no judgement.</em></p>

<p><strong>THE LES BAGEL</strong>: Many a walk of shame originates on the Lower East Side, but you can quickly turn onlookers&apos; gazes from scorn to jealousy by picking up an everything bagel with lox and the works from <strong>Atlas Cafe on Clinton Street</strong>. The lox is from Russ &amp; Daughters and the bagel is H&amp;H; (yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/11/and_thus_continues_the_tragic.php">somehow they keep getting them</a>) and the nourishment is unparalleled. Pickled onions will banish any hint of stale Jameson on your breath, while the chewy, noble everything bagel reupholsters your booze-ravaged gut like nonjudgmental HGTV host. And tomato is a fruit! The staff at Atlas is friendly and fast&#x2014;they can practically hear the pounding in your head. One of these babies and a large cup of coffee is under $10. Considering that this combo will give you the strength to take the subway home instead of a taxi, it pays for itself.  &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://twitter.com/christrobbins"><em>Chris Robbins</em></a></p>

<p><strong>THE MIDTOWN LUMBERJACK</strong>: The <strong>Eggs Travaganza food cart in Midtown</strong> has a strong following. Why? They&apos;ll serve you up a steak and egg taco for just 4 bucks, but they&apos;ll also conquer your appetite with something a little more healthy (an egg white sandwich, a veggie and protein wrap... whatever you want). But when you&apos;re hungover you probably crave something a little more gut-busting. For that, order up The Lumberjack: homemade pancakes, two eggs any style, served with bacon, ham or sausage. Not your style? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150135477639438.299872.116032664437&amp;type=3">Here&apos;s a mouthwatering gallery of images</a> to whet your appetite.&#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://twitter.com/jenist"><em>Jen Carlson</em></a></p>

<p><strong>THE UES RAMEN</strong>: Whenever we&apos;ve taken in one too many Natty Lights we crave a steaming bowl of fatty noodles in broth to soothe our rumbling stomach. The tiny <strong>Upper East Side ramen bar Naruto Ramen</strong> doesn&apos;t provide much in the way of looks, but their enormous bowls of soup pack a serious gut-busting punch that will knock out a hangover in minutes. We&apos;re partial to the Tantan Ramen, a rich, spicy broth flavored with sesame sauce and served with a fish cake, beansprouts, scallions and fatty bits of minced pork. You&apos;ll need a post-slurping nap but you probably needed one anyway. &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://twitter.com/nellcasey"><em>Nell Casey</em></a></p>

<p><strong>THE WILLIAMSBURG EGG SANDWICH</strong>: To awaken hungover in Williamsburg is to awaken surrounded by dangerous brunch landmines. Oh, there are plenty of options, but few can give you what you need: something substantial in your belly NOW NOW NOW. For those crippling hangovers that leave you one misstep away from a homicidal rampage, a 45 minute wait for brunch isn&apos;t going to cut it, and even facing the chaotic clusterfuck of The Bagel Shop will probably end with your appearance on the nightly news. </p>

<p>Fortunately, there is La Villita, which, as you can see from the photo, is the kind of weird hole-in-the-wall joint you might walk by a thousand times without a second thought. But the creepy window displays ward off the trendy throngs, and that&apos;s only part of the appeal. In addition to a tempting array of pastries and sweets, the friendly ladies at La Villita make a blissfully perfect egg sandwich. They grill the French roll a little bit so it&apos;s warm and soft, and make the sandwiches with whatever extras you want, from bacon to sauteed onions to Swiss cheese to salsa verde. Even after ordering a cup of coffee with warm milk, you&apos;re sated for less than $5, and there are a couple little tables in the front where you can administer immediate hangover relief. &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://twitter.com/johndelsignore"><em>John Del Signore</em></a></p>

Is a fast food breakfast really the way to kick off a New Year? That&apos;s your own demon to battle.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>*THE LOUIS IN YOUR KITCHEN:</strong> Can&apos;t fathom the idea of leaving your apartment? Anna Gianfrancesco, who would sometimes get behind the grill at the aforementioned Louis to make their egg n&apos; cheese masterpiece for me personally, tells us the secret behind it. &quot;The secret is splitting the roll down the center and buttering the whole thing beforehand, then grill it until it&apos;s a little crispy. Add the cooked eggs and cheese (a good amount of cheese) on top. It&apos;s honestly still may favorite sandwich there.&quot; She noted that you can feel free to improvise by adding sausage, potatoes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212753/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/drinking_for_journalism_we_put_thre.php">Bytox</a>... whatever!</p>
