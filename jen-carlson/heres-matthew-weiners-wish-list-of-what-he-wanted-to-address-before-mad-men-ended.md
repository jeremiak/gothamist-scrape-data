<p>While Matthew Weiner certainly tied up a lot of loose ends in a hurry on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201258/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/18/mad_men_finale_om.php">the final episode</a> of <em>Mad Men</em>, he left a lot to live and die in the writer&apos;s room. Peggy and Pete&apos;s lovechild (who disappeared faster than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201258/http://bradybunch.wikia.com/wiki/The_Brady_Bunch_pets">the Brady Bunch dog</a>) and Sal (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201258/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/19/mad_men_bellhop_talks.php">Sal</a>!), to name a few. Some storylines left up in the air were bigger than others, and most fates that were left to the audience&apos;s imagination belonged to minor characters anyway&#x2014;but there were a few who were left MIA that fans of the show grumbled about, either because they were more beloved than others (again, Sal!), or because their existence was tied to a bigger storyline.</p>

<p>Last night, the show&apos;s writers appeared on a Writer&#x2019;s Guild Foundation panel, and one EW reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201258/https://twitter.com/Breznican/status/604110676538171393">tweeted this picture</a> of Weiner&#x2019;s largely unfulfilled wish list of what to address before the show faded to black. Here it is, below, with some items crossed off by Weiner&#x2014;it seems to be from a few years ago, at least, since in it Pete&apos;s mother is still alive (presumably he crossed her off when she died in season 6). One person missing is Megan, so we&apos;ll just assume she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201258/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/a_mad_men_conspiracy_theory_is_mega.php">murdered by the Manson Family</a>, after all.<br>
