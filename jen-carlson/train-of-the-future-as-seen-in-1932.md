The future, straphangers, is all about endless belt trains! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226210256/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2008/01/10/endless-belt-trains-for-future-cities">Modern Mechanix</a> takes a look at the November 1932 debut of the vision:</p><blockquote>Transporation of city inhabitants through subway or overhead tubes on endlessly moving belts, providing more speed and comfort than our present systems of passenger service, loom as a possibility, according to Norman W. Storer, engineer of the Westinghouse Electrical Co., who has developed the idea.<p></p>

<p>As described by Mr. Storer, the system is an arrangement of continuous trains or belts of cars, running on parallel tracks. There is a stationary loading platform along the entire course of the system.</p></blockquote>On top of all that, city inhabitants, the train would stop every 50 seconds, for 10 seconds, signaled by a gong sound (of course).When the doors close, another signal announces another set of gates opening &quot;for a second platform, or express (traveling at 22mph), on which the passenger takes the major part of his trip.&quot;  They also promised &quot;all elements being so timed that there can be no hitches.&quot; All aboard?
