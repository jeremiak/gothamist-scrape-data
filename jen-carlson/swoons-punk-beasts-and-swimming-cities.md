</div></div>					<p>Following her trip on the Hudson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011201241/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/03/swoon_artist.php">Swoon</a> got a bit more adventurous and gathered up more than 30 other artists to help her take her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011201241/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/19/swoon_2.php">Swimming Cities</a> to the Adriatic Sea. Three handcrafted vessels navigated the waters, and ended up crashing the Venice Biennale in Italy. Luckily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011201241/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/31/tod_seelie_phot.php">Tod Seelie</a> was on hand to capture it all, and now his photographs will be on exhibit, starting tonight, at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011201241/http://anonymousgallery.com/art/">Anonymous Gallery</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Pankabestia: Punk Beasts of the Swimming Cities of Serenissima,&quot; is considered a retrospective of the journey and will also include large-scale wall drawings, original Swimming Cities boat installations, portions of the ships, and found objects acquired from sea. The opening reception is tonight from 6 to 9 p.m.</p>
