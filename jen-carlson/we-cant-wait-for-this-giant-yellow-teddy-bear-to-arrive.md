<p>Feeling down, what with the grey skies and rain? Maybe a giant yellow teddy bear will turn your mood around. Christie&apos;s is setting up a 20-ton bronze teddy bear in a Park Avenue plaza outside of the Seagram Building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802015400/http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=46276">this week</a>! It was created by New York-based artist Uri Fischer, and is getting auctioned off at the house next month.</p>

<p>The 23-foot-tall yellow bear is called &quot;Untitled (Lamp/Bear)&quot;&#x2014;yes, your childhood stuffed animal probably had a more imaginative name&#x2014;and it&apos;s expected to go for over $10 million. There are two others&#x2014;one sitting on the Montauk lawn of entrepreneur Adam Lindemann. They all include a desk lamp that the bear is leaning against, which lights up at night.</p>

<p>Christie&apos;s deputy chairman for Post-War and Contemporary Art says, &quot;We have seen contemporary sculpture works by Jeff Koons selling at $25 million and Urs Fischer is the leading pretender to the throne. He is considered the most important, the most provocative of contemporary artists today.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802015400/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703806304576232830554002602.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal</a>, six city permits were needed to bring this bear to town, and when it&apos;s installed this week it will take about 30 workers to put it together.</p>
