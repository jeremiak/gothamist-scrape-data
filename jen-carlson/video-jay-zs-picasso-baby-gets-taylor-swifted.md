<p>In the world of art, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928040020/http://gothamist.com/tags/taylorswift">Taylor Swift</a> Art would be like, the posters you really wanted to buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928040020/http://www.spencersonline.com/lifestyle_room-decor_wall-decor_posters/">at Spencer Gifts</a> when you were younger and at the mall with your after-school-job money. Or maybe an adorable needlepoint of deer from Etsy. Art so removed from real art that it doesn&apos;t make you think, it just makes you feel nice. Or maybe it&apos;s just fleeting, addictive entertainment that you keep returning to until it gets old and you move on/throw it in the garbage. Either way, it&apos;s nice to have a little bit of it around sometimes. So even if you haven&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928040020/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/03/video_heres_jay_zs_picasso_baby_wit.php#photo-1">watched Jay-Z&apos;s &quot;Picasso Baby&quot; performance art video</a> (or have no idea who this Taylor Swift lady is), you should watch this one, which has been recut with Swift&apos;s &quot;22&quot;:</p>
