<p>For those lamenting over the loss of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326003706/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/24/has_new_york_city_lost_its_edge.php">edgy New York City</a>&quot;&#x2014;look no further than the New York Historical Society. The establishment is in possession of a book containing all the best (and worst) brothels in 19th century New York (and we all have is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326003706/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-12-09/village-voice-media-sex-slaves-in-the-classified/">the Village Voice classifieds</a>). Held under lock and key it&apos;s a time capsule to a grittier time, and recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326003706/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/on-the-records-a-well-preserved-roadmap-to-perdition/">the Grey Lady</a> dared peek inside (flip through the book yourself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326003706/http://documents.nytimes.com/a-vest-pocket-guide-to-brothels-in-19th-century-new-york-for-gentlemen-on-the-go">here</a>).</p>

<p>What they discovered in The Gentleman&apos;s Directory, circa 1870, were 150 brothels&#x2014;a Zagat-esque guide to the seedier side of the city, and at the time easily picked up at newsstands. The guide claimed to deliver &#x201C;<strong>insight into the character and doings of people whose deeds are carefully screened from public view.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Some listings warned the reader of which establishments to avoid, noting, &#x201C;Not that we imagine the reader will ever desire to visit these houses. Certainly not. We point out the location of these places in order that the reader may know how to avoid them.&quot; Some hot spots highlighted with more positive reviews, however, included Harry Hill&#x2019;s place on 25 East Houston Street, Ada Blashfield of 55 West Houston Street (which housed &#x201C;8 to 10 boarders both blondes and brunettes&#x201D;) and Mrs. Wright&#x2019;s place at 61 Elizabeth Street. There were estimated to be around 500 brothels in the city at that time, with 150 listed in this book (and 23 on West 27th Street alone).</p>

<p>The servicey book even included a listing for anyone wanting good conversation: just check out the &#x201C;seven beautiful young lady scholars&#x201D; of the &#x201C;Ladies Seminary&#x201D; on 123 West 27th Street! Of course, those seeking more than conversation were advised to also seek out &#x201C;French imported male safes&quot; (condoms!) from Dr. Charles Manches.</p>

<p>We weren&apos;t the only city with these guidebooks, either, down in New Orleans a similar guide was brought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326003706/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/200105A46.html">to Antiques Roadshow</a>, which was determined to be &quot;a guide to sporting houses and loose women.&quot;</p>
