<p>Last year &quot;artist&quot; Richard Prince blew up and made prints of other people&apos;s Instagram photos for his series titled &quot;New Portraits.&quot; He sold these prints <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170704133123/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/21/artist_steals_instagram_photos_sell.php">for around $90,000 a piece</a> during a private show at the Gagosian. More recently, he brought his work to the Frieze Art Fair, where most of the Instagrams he used for a new set of prints came from the SuicideGirls. </p>

<p>The SuicideGirls have now responded to the rip-off artist. Yesterday, Missy (founder of the SG) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170704133123/https://suicidegirls.com/members/missy/blog/2837632/tuesday/">posted the following</a>:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="newnewGAGPRINCE15.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170704133123im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newnewGAGPRINCE15.jpg" width="350" height="311"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> (Gagosian)</i></div> <blockquote>Everyone has been asking me what I thought about famous controversial artist Richard Prince taking a series of Suicide Girls Instagram posts and printing them out and selling them at a recent show for $90,000.<p></p>

<p>My first thought was I don&#x2019;t know anyone who can spend $90,000 on anything other than a house. Maybe I know a few people who can spend it on a car. As to the copyright issue? If I had a nickel for every time someone used our images without our permission in a commercial endeavour I&#x2019;d be able to spend $90,000 on art. I was once really annoyed by Forever 21 selling shirts with our slightly altered images on them, but an Artist?</p>

<p>Richard Prince is an artist and he found the images we and our girls publish on instagram as representative of something worth commenting on, part of the zeitgeist, I guess? Thanks Richard! I&#x2019;m just bummed that his art is out of reach for people like me and the people portrayed in the art he is selling.</p>

<p>So we at SuicideGirls are going to sell the exact same prints people payed $90,000 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170704133123/https://suicidegirls.com/shop/instagram-art-1/">for $90 each</a>. I hope you love them. Beautiful Art, 99.9% off the original price. ;)</p>

<p>Do we have Mr. Prince&#x2019;s permission to sell these prints? We have the same permission from him that he had from us. </p>

<p>We will be donating the profits from sales to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170704133123/http://EFF.ORG/">EFF.ORG</a></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Just as Prince did, the SuicideGirls have also added their own comment to the bottom of each print&#x2014;each one reads: &quot;True art.&quot;</p>

<p>Prince has been responding to the critics on Twitter: </p>

<p>Meanwhile, art critic Jerry Saltz still thinks it&apos;s all &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170704133123/http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/richard-prince-instagram-pervert-troll-genius.html">genius trolling</a>&quot;:</p>
