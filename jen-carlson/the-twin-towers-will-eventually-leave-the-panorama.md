<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161337/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/the_giant_nyc_panorama_is_getting_a.php#comment-453512385">some commenters</a> were curious about the Twin Towers on the Queens Museum of Art&apos;s panorama, we reached out to the museum to get some answers. The Twin Towers are currently still on the panorama, and we were told this afternoon:</p>

<blockquote>They will stay up at least until the building of the new World Trade Center is complete. At that point, we will install a model of the new WTC and remove the Twin Towers from the Panorama and place them in a vitrine to be displayed in the same room as the Panorama.</blockquote>

<p>The towers actually haven&apos;t been there <em>that</em> long, they were added when the museum last updated the panorama in 1992.</p>
