title: Yogi Berra's #8 Jersey Now On View At City Hall
---

	
										<p>Legendary New York Yankee (and Met) Yogi Berra died at the age of 90 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210185241/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/yogi_berra_its_over.php">on Tuesday</a>, and the city he played ball in is honoring his life. Thanks de Blasio! (Really.)</p>

<p>All flags shall be flown at half-staff, ordered the Mayor yesterday, hours before the Empire State Building donned pinstripes for the player. Flags (including American, NY State and City, and POW-MIA) will remain at half-staff in all five boroughs through sunset tonight. But the big tribute is Berra&apos;s #8 jersey, which is now hanging at City Hall behind seats from the old Yankee and Shea Stadiums, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210185241/http://www.yogiberramuseum.org/">the Yogi Museum</a>.</p>

&#x201C;The people of New York City have lost Yogi Berra&#x2014;and one of the people I think defines life in this city,&quot; de Blasio said in a statement yesterday. He continued:</p><blockquote>&quot;We all looked up to Yogi. We all felt a personal sense of connection. I think for so many of us, that felt like there&#x2019;s another member of our families, and that was Yogi Berra. What was so endearing about him was the warmth, and the wit, and the humanity, and, yes, the foibles. There are many Yogi-isms, and they are often a part of our life in the city. My personal favorite&#x2014;I quote it often&#x2014;is the famous &#x2018;90 percent of this game is half mental&#x2019;&#x2014; which I think could be said of public life as well. But it&#x2019;s a day to celebrate all that Yogi Berra has meant to New York City. It&#x2019;s obviously a sad day, but a day to celebrate 90 extraordinary years and a real part of our culture.&#x201D;</blockquote> But you know what they say, it ain&apos;t over until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210185241/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/sports/yogi-berra-yogi-isms-quotes-explored.html">the NY Times fact checks you</a>.<p></p>
