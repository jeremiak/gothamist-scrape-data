</div></div>					<p>The Bowery is one of Manhattan&#x2019;s oldest and most notorious thoroughfares. Entire books have been written about it, but for quick look back, click through for 21 historic photos, and some facts below:</p>

<li>The Bowery once stretched from Canal to Union Square. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154124/http://boweryalliance.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/peter_BAN_-_Historical__Cultural_Significance_of_Bowery.221150535.pdf">PDF</a>)
</li><li>On November 25th, 1783, Washington celebrated the British evacuation of NYC at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154124/http://theboweryboys.blogspot.com/2009/03/bulls-head-tavern-hey-astor-wheres-beef.html">Bull&#x2019;s Head Tavern</a> at 46-48 Bowery. 
</li><li> In the 1800s, gangs like the Bowery B&#x2019;hoys and Dead Rabbits were headquartered on the Bowery. And in the early 1900s, Paul Kelly&#x2019;s Five Point Gang was operating out of 338 Bowery.
</li><li>In the 1890s, there were a dozen gay bars in the Bowery area. &quot;Gay subculture was more highly visible there and more integrated into working-class male culture than it was to become in the following generations,&quot; according to author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154124/http://books.google.com/books?id=NNHGuVdPELYC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=bowery+gay+bars+1890s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Oap6VFGiV&amp;sig=FGGsEA8yDEC1nHqjsmv4OtGunZg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vHUNUI6EEZDG0AHPpoCGBA&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bowery%20gay%20bars%201890s&amp;f=false">George Chauncey</a>.
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154124/http://rob.hilluva.com/writing/McGurksSuicideHall.html">McGurk&#x2019;s Suicide Hall</a> (which was open from 1895 through1902) was located at 295 Bowery, and &quot;became the suicide den of choice for Bowery prostitutes down on their luck.&quot;
</li><li>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154124/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Avenue_El">3rd Avenue El</a> ran above Bowery from 1878 to 1955&#x2014;In 1919 Century magazine wrote: &quot;It is filled with employment agencies, cheap clothing and knickknack stores, cheap moving-picture shows, cheap lodging-houses, cheap eating-houses, cheap saloons. Here, too, by the thousands come sailors on shore leave&#x2014;notice the &apos;studios&apos; of the tattoo artists&#x2014;and here most in evidence are the &apos;down and outs.&apos;&quot;
