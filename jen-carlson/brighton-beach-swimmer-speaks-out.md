										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpdhlDMSPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529000251im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpdhlDMSPM.jpg" width="350" height="295" class="image-right"> </span>Wednesday night a few Russian women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529000251/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/27/parks_dept_busts_middle-aged_russia.php">were ticketed $250</a> a piece for swimming past 6 p.m. at Brighton Beach. The Parks security allegedly threatened to jail them and check up on their immigration statuses. While the Parks Dept. told us that &quot;New York State law does not allow you to swim at your own risk,&quot; the swimmers (and eyewitnesses) say that the lifeguards never alerted them that the beach was closing, and simply clocked out without getting anyone out of the water.</p>

<p>One of the women fined, Irina Kovaneva, told us her side of the story, which you can read below:</p><blockquote>&quot;We came to the U.S. to escape the Communism regime, the regime when every step is watched and controlled by the government. What I am facing with this incident is a liberal fascism, when government interferes in your personal life and tells you what you should do, how, and when. You feel like you are not responsible for your life any more. Somebody else is. Where is freedom?&quot;</blockquote>Continue reading after the jump, where Kovaneva brings up a good point about paying lifeguards to stay on duty an extra hour or two during the summer.<p></p>
