The concierges of the city make hundreds of recommendations a day, so it&apos;s only natural they get their own nights at restaurants like The Palm. </p>

<p>The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180536/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/theater/27conc.html?ref=arts">looked at the world of concierges</a> when they are being courted:   A dinner at the Palm after a matinee of &quot;Hairspray&quot;.  Earlier in the week they saw &#x201C;The Pirate Queen,&#x201D; enjoyed the Russian Tea Room, and took in a performance by the Paul Taylor Dance Company at City Center. All in producers&apos; /restaurateurs&apos; hopes that when out-of-towners want to know what to see or where to eat, one of these will be recommended. The NY Times spoke to one concierge, Mr. Domenick, about the pitfalls:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I sent a family of 13 to see &#x2018;Company,&#x2019; &#x201D; Mr. Domenick said, adding that he described the plot and mentioned the occasional salty patch. &#x201C;Well, 9 of them left. They were with kids, and they were from the Bible Belt.&#x201D; He had given them fair warning, he said. &#x201C;Look, I can&#x2019;t give you a transcript.&#x201D;</blockquote>Ha!  But we&apos;re sure Rent seem risque when it first came out.  James Jolis, a poetry-at-Stanford and former Barry Manilow backup singer who is now the head concierge at the Michelangelo on West 51st Street, says one surefire Broadway crowdpleaser is &#x201C;The Drowsy Chaperone.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Do you play concierge for your visiting-from-out-of-town friends and relatives?  How do you help them with their choices for things to do, places to eat?<br>
