In January 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/27/union_hall_no_l.php">Union Hall</a> put up a &quot;No Strollers Please&quot; sign on their door, only to be met by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/01/union_hall_sort.php">outraged</a> Park Slope parents. The stroller war has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/park_slope_parents_still_bringing_b.php">raged on</a> in bars in the borough since (for a while there it even looked like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/12/park_slopes_fornino.php">Fornino</a> may join in), and just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/17/babies_in_bars.php">this February</a> Double Windsor instituted a stroller ban during certain hours. And now The Gate has fallen...</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://brooklynian.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=694499">Brooklynian</a> poster saw this sign over the weekend (but we hear it&apos;s been up since Memorial Day). It boldly declares:</p>

<blockquote>NO STROLLERS FRIDAY THRU SUNDAY &amp; HOLIDAYS

<p>Sorry Friends, owing to severe stroller and chair overcrowding as of late, we are now enforcing a NO STROLLER policy on WEEKENDS &amp; HOLIDAYS at The Gate</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gate-brooklyn">their Yelp rating</a> gain or lose some stars after this move? In the past, one poster noted: &quot;I do actually have a beef with the Gate, but it&apos;s not their fault. It&apos;s the people that bring their strollers and brood along with them while they booze it up. <b>I wish parents would stop ruining everybody else&apos;s fun by toting their babies everywhere.</b> It&apos;s a bar, people. No one wants to hear baby-talk and smell diapers while they&apos;re having a drink with someone they&apos;re trying to hook up with. <strong>Pay for a baby-sitter, you selfish Bjorn-jockeys!</strong>&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517002833/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/breaking-the-gate-is-now-a-no-stroller-zone-on-weekends-also.html">Erica at FIPS</a>, who endorses the new stroller ban, but notes that she can still bring her dog to The Gate]</p>
