<p>Michelangelo&apos;s David is coming to New York City! Except, not the real one... a larger, golden version will be brought in on a trailer next Tuesday. The massive recreation was created by Serkan Ozkaya (who holds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150707/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serkan_%C3%96zkaya">an MFA from Bard College</a>) in 2005, and will eventually be brought to the 21c Museum, who &quot;commissioned the 30-foot-tall sculpture&#x2019;s journey from Istanbul to New York.&quot; Following its stop here, it will head on to its forever home in Louisville, Kentucky. Precisely where one would imagine a 30-foot-tall golden David to live. To catch a glimpse of what we hope becomes a roadside attraction in Kentucky one day, free up some time next Tuesday:</p>

<blockquote>David (inspired by Michelangelo) will travel throughout New York City on a lowboy trailer on March 6th, passing various landmarks including Times Square, Museum Mile, and the High Line. The sculpture will be parked in front of the Storefront for Art and Architecture starting at 3 p.m. A live-staging of manifestos on the topic of the double by a group of panelists will take place at Storefront from 6:30 to 9pm. The panel will be moderated by Serkan Ozkaya.</blockquote>

<p>If you go, ask why the statue appears to be suffering from shrinkage... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150707/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Serkan_ozkaya_david.jpg">you cold, bro</a>?</p>
