<p>Last year proper Danish food finally came to New York City with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024028/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/aamann-copenhagen_brings_copenhagen.php#photo-1">the opening of Aamanns-Copenhagen</a>, a restaurant completely dedicated to not just Danish food and drink, but also design. We finally got a chance to check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024028/http://www.aamanns-copenhagen.com/">the TriBeCa joint</a> at a press dinner launching the new Nordic dinner menu last week, and can honestly not say enough good things about the vibe, the drinks, and the food that came out of chef Carl Kristian Frederiksen&apos;s kitchen. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024028/http://www.aamanns-copenhagen.com/menus/dinner/">new menu</a> features some perfect fare for light summer dining ($10-19): Salted Beets and Lingonberries, Pickled Cabbage, Blackened Mackerel and Local Bacon (diner take note: this bacon is <em>fresh</em>, not burnt to a crisp like you may be accustomed to), and Beef Tartare. Larger entrees ($19-29) include Butter-Fried Hake, Slow-Cooked Pork Belly, and Local Piedmontese New York Strip. Also: cheese plates, bread and butter, and plenty of pickled things are available if you just want to snack. Everything is so incredibly fresh that we probably mentioned it more than a handful of times during the course of the meal.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll definitely want to save some space for their innovative desserts, too&#x2014;you can see their Nordic Carrot with White Chocolate and Chocolate Ganache pictured above, but their Danish &#x201D;R&#xF8;dgr&#xF8;d ($11)&#x2014;a hot seasonal red berry porridge with fresh  berries, meringue, whipped cream, and dried herbs&#x2014;is a real show-stopper. Here&apos;s how it&apos;s presented:</p>

<p>We&apos;ve yet to try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024028/http://www.aamanns-copenhagen.com/menus/sunday-brunch/">their brunch</a>, which has just launched, but the brunch plates start at $25 and come with (at minimum) a soft-boiled egg, cheeses, salads, soup, homemade yogurt and granola, and a house-made bread basket with a roll, slice of rye bread and a Danish pastry served with Danish butter and homemade jam. </p>

<p>They also have smaller separate dishes, as well as brunch cocktails&#x2014;like their house-made Bloody Mary with your choice of bacon, ramp, or lemongrass akvavits. Which brings us to the very important akvavits (or aquavits, if you prefer)...</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="php76c4G3AM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024028im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php76c4G3AM.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span><br>

<p>Akvavit is a traditional Scandinavian spirit, flavored with spices and herbs, and they are delicious. Their house flavors&#x2014;prominently displayed behind the bar&#x2014;rotate, and currently the menu includes: dill, parsley, lemon, fig, cumin, plum, ramp, rye, blueberry, lemongrass, pear/vanilla, coriander, bacon and beet. These are in almost all of their signature cocktails ($14), but you can also order them separately ($7).</p>

<p>As an aside on the atmosphere: their outdoor dining features fake grass separating the sidewalk dining area from the sidewalk itself, and it&apos;s a nice touch that more restaurants should take note of!</p>
