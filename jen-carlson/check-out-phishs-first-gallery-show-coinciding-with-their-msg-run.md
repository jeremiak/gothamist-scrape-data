<p>Phish, which turned 30 this month, is primed to do another four night takeover of Madison Square Garden starting tomorrow (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203954/http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113820/political-journalists-find-refuge-phish-listserv">some insiders</a> call this magical time of year &quot;Phishmas&quot;). If you got shut out by the evil robots that run Ticketmaster, don&apos;t want to watch it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203954/http://www.livephish.com/phish/New-Years-2013-MSG-Webcast.asp?utm_campaign=131227&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=livephish">on a screen</a>, and haven&apos;t been miracled (yet!), then you can always go stare at some photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203954/http://gothamist.com/tags/phish">the band</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203954/http://i.imgur.com/6VKNj1x.jpg">Woo</a>?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203954/http://phish.com/news/phish-photography-exhibit-at-morrison-hotel-gallery/">Phish.com</a>, &quot;The band will have its first official photography exhibit at the famed Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York beginning December 28th. The special exhibition features the photography of Danny Clinch, Brantley Gutierrez, C. Taylor Crothers, Rene Huemer, Dave Vann, Jay Blakesberg, &amp; BC Kagan.&quot; It will run through February 2nd at their 116 Prince Street location (2nd floor).</p>

<p>We contacted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203954/https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/new.aspx">the gallery</a> for more photos to share with you guys but... everyone seems delightfully confused about this exhibit, which does not even appear to be listed on their website. So for now just gaze into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205203954/https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photo/default.aspx?photographID=5386">Trey&apos;s gloriously goofy mug</a> and... what were we talking about?</p>
