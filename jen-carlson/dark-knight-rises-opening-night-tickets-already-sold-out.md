<p>There are still six more solid months between us and the premiere of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131529/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a>, but that&apos;s nothing considering the hype started long ago. So naturally, when tickets went on sale for opening night (July 19th at midnight), those coveted IMAX tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131529/http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/01/10/the-dark-knight-rises-tickets-midnight/">sold out</a> immediately. Which means there&apos;s currently a lot of price gouging happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131529/http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/tix/mnh?query=dark+knight&amp;srchType=A&amp;minAsk=&amp;maxAsk=">on Craigslist</a>, with single tickets going for around 100 bucks.</p>

<p>On Monday, it was being reported that Fandango quietly started selling tickets, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131529/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-dark-knight-rises-tickets-280492">The Hollywood Reporter</a> explains that when the six-minute prologue screened before Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol in December, &quot;AMC theater managers in New York, Los Angeles and San Fransisco decided to poll the fanboys in attendance on who was interested in buying midnight tickets to see the Batman pic on July 19. Based on that on-site demand, Fandango decided to start selling additional midnight tickets for <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>The movie actually only features about 40 minutes of footage shot with Imax cameras, but these blockbusters are always viewed best on those big, big screens.</p>
