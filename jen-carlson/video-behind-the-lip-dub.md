title: Video: Behind the Lip Dub
---

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163317/http://www.flickr.com/photos/thechickenkid/3233231378">reader</a> sent in this video that he took last week, saying, &quot;I filmed this girl (filming her music video?) on the train the other day and am dying to figure out where I can find her final cut, or even who she is. Any ideas?&quot; Looks like a (really passionate!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163317/http://www.vimeo.com/lipdub">lip dub</a> in the making, yet can&apos;t be found on YouTube or Vimeo. Alas, will this lip dub fall in the forest?</p>

<p>Any guesses as to what song it could be?</p>
