Next up is Nick Kroll, actor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052036/http://imdb.com/title/tt0981216">caveman</a> and one of our favorite comedians of &apos;07...and probably &apos;08.</em></p>

<p><strong>What did you do last New Years Eve? What will you do this year?</strong><br>
Last year i listened to a cab driver complain about how a girl pee&apos;d in his cab. I don&apos;t know why i would do anything different this year.</p>

<p><strong>Any resolutions going into 2008?</strong><br>
The same resolution I have every year; to stay hydrated.</p>

<p><strong>Best meal you had in the city this year.</strong><br>
Momofoku Saam bar. If I had to choose between their pork buns and ejaculating I would choose the pork buns because they can bring me to orgasm.</p>

<p><strong>Best concert you saw in the city this year.</strong><br>
The Dave Hill explosion at the UCB Theater with special guests Dick Cavett and Rufus Wainwright. Rufus wainwright told an amazing story about Walter Matthau&apos;s trip to Auschwitz.</p>

<p><strong>Most interesting New Yorker you met this year.</strong><br>
The most interesting New Yorker i met this year was on the subway: Dr Jeffrey Sizmore.</p>

<p><strong>Most memorable &quot;only in New York&quot; story of 2007.</strong><br>
When i jumped from the Empire State Building to the Brooklyn Bridge and, in mid-air, i ran into mayor Bloomberg as he was eating a Katz&apos;s pastrami sandwich with the Naked Cowboy and i thought to myself, &apos;only in Chicago.&apos;</p>

<p><strong>What trend do you think will be &quot;big in &apos;08&quot; in the city?</strong><br>
Friendster.</p>
