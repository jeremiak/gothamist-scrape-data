</div></div>					<p>The Georgia O&apos;Keeffe exhibit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150321/http://whitney.org/www/exhibition/okeeffe.jsp">at the Whitney</a> opened yesterday, and it may not be what you expect. The artist created some lesser known abstract works throughout her career, which have remained overlooked in favor of her landscapes and flowers. This exhibit, fittingly called &quot;Abstraction&quot; acknowledges those works. The exhibit includes 130 paintings, drawings, watercolors and sculptures, as well as photos of the artist by Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in New York City and introduced her to many early American modernists.</p>

<p>&quot;Abstraction&quot; will run through January; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150321/http://whitney.org/www/exhibition/okeeffe.jsp">more details here</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150321/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/arts/design/18okeeffe.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> has a review. Bonus: tomorrow night you can see Joan Allen portray the artist in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150321/http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/movies/georgia-okeeffe">a Lifetime movie</a>.</p>
