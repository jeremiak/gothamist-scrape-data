<span class="photo_caption">Photo by SR</span></p>

<p>A reader sent in the above photo, noting it was taken &quot;at 6 p.m. on a crowded downtown 6 train during Friday rush hour. She got on the train at Grand Central and stayed on until Bleecker Street.&quot; First of all, there&apos;s the obvious bicycle issue, but as a second subway etiquette offense, the cyclist is also wearing an overstuffed backpack, taking up a total of, let&apos;s say, three spots where other humans could fit. We&apos;ve already addressed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174955/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/30/psa_please_stop_wearing_backpacks_o.php">the backpack issue</a> in our ongoing quest to tame the animals that one can encounter out there, but what about bicycle etiquette&#x2014;when is it okay to haul your two-wheeler onto the subway?<br>
</p><ul><li>When it&apos;s raining or snowing (which it wasn&apos;t when this photo was taken).<br>
</li><li>When your bike is in need of repair, and you are nowhere near a place that can fix it for you.<br>
</li><li>When it&apos;s <em>not</em> rush hour/crowded.<br>
</li><li>When you&apos;re injured.<br>
</li><li>When you win a bicycle as a gift but are scared to bike it home because you have never biked in the city before.<br>
</li><li>When you&apos;re tripping face and the bike tells you it wants to ride the subway.*</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Those are really the only acceptable times! If you want to take mass transit, just leave your bike at home or chained up.</p>
