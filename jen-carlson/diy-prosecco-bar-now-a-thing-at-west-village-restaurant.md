<p>Remember when the term DIY used to signify the punk rock ethos of defiantly independent creativity? Well, things change&#x2014;Minor Threat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126051817/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/14/mackaye_mildly.php">is now a hot sauce</a>, and brunch is now totally DIY. Squeeze your toddler into his favorite CBGB T-shirt and wheel the stroller on over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126051817/http://sotto13.com/">Sotto 13</a> for their <em>fabulous</em> new DIY Prosecco Bar. The West Village restaurant is newly opened, based around a foundation of shareable plates and Italian &quot;social dining,&quot; and their big sell brunch gimmick is this $40 Prosecco tray... though it looks like you&apos;ll need to BYO-Kale Juice: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The concept allows Brunchers to become their own mixologists with a bottle of prosecco and a tray of five mixers, including signature fresh juices, liqueurs and toss-ins like candied ginger, fresh berries and more&#x2014;complete with stirring spoon and measuring glass. Guests can use the provided recipe card or freestyle it to craft their very own bubbly brunch cocktails (priced from $40 per DIY tray which includes one bottle of Prosecco, additional bottles/ trays can be purchased separately).&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Their brunch also includes food, which you don&apos;t need to prepare yourself, including: Cacio e Pepe with soft scrambled eggs topped with Cacio cheese, Baked Crispelle, Tuscan Eggs; Brioche French Toast Sticks; and brunch pizzas topped with everything from spicy salami to brussel sprouts.</p>
