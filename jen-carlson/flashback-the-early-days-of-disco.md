<p>Disco is dead, but that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t revisit it every now and again. The above photo was taken in 1969 at a club called The Sanctuary; the caption reads: &quot;Former German Lutheran church is now thriving as a disco called Sanctuary Club.&quot; Located at 407 West 43rd Street (between 9th and 10th avenues), it was founded by Arnie Lord and was initially called The Church. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132132/http://www.disco-disco.com/clubs/identify-clubs.shtml">this website</a>, the official maximum capacity was 346, but more than 1000 people would cram in on a normal night. It was also the &quot;first totally uninhibited gay discotheque in America,&quot; and catered to a mixed crowd of &quot;conservative wealthy men, street kids and even hookers.&quot; It was up and running from 1969 to 1973 (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132132/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco#1966.E2.80.931974:_Early_history">very early years</a> of disco), and in 1971 was even used in the Jane Fonda movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132132/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067309/"><em>Klute</em></a>.</p>

<p>Currently the building houses The WestSide Theatre, where you may have seen <em>The Vagina Monologues</em>.</p>
