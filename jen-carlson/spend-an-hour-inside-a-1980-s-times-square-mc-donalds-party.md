<p>In 1989, convicted murderer (but then professional party boy) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127103619/http://gothamist.com/tags/michaelalig">Michael Alig</a> hosted an event at the McDonald&apos;s on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127103619/https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7586736,-73.9850234,3a,75y,90.04h,82.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sYPMXHrs2PZk0QAdmXoPwLA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1">Broadway and 46th Street</a>. This was one of his outlaw parties, which Michael Musto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127103619/http://www.villagevoice.com/blogs/worst-parties-of-all-time-club-kid-outlaw-bash-6368344">described as</a> &quot;bashes illegally held at some public space or other, where everyone showed up on time for a change, knowing the cops would come and bust it up the second they got wind of it.&quot; This one took place at 3 a.m.</p>

<p>One hour of the night, from the cab ride there until everyone gets kicked out, has just been uploaded to YouTube. This was all shot by Nelson Sullivan, who (thankfully) filmed everything back then. Seriously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151127103619/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/22/a_tour_of_late_80s_nyc_courtesy_of.php">thousands upon thousands of hours</a> of young people, just L-I-V-I-N in 1980s and 1990s NYC. </p>

<p>If it seems familiar, this footage was recreated in <em>Party Monster</em>.</p>
