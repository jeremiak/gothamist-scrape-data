<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062214/http://www.jaunted.com/story/2008/1/9/22328/25543/travel/JetBlue+Travel%3A+Inside+the+New+Terminal+5">Jaunted took a jaunt</a> over to the new Terminal 5 (not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062214/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/14/new_venue_alert.php">the music venue</a>) at JFK. The terminal, with design <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062214/http://www.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek04/tw0820/0820jet_blue.htm">by Gensler</a>, will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062214/http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/jetblue/">house JetBlue</a> and is set to open in September of this year. </p>

<p>The original T5 was the Eero Saarinen-designed TWA terminal and will be incorporated into JetBlue&apos;s, which is set behind and connected to it (Jaunted notes that &quot;airline reps say that at minimum there&apos;ll be check-in kiosks in the TWA building.&quot;) Some highlights: </p>

<p><strong>The Departures Hall:</strong> You can get to the terminal via the usual ways auto and AirTran, and there will be a 900-foot covered walkway connecting to the latter. Upon arrival you&apos;ll see security, &quot;which has been pushed to the very forefront of the terminal. Plans call for 20 lanes in one big checkpoint; the current JB terminal has about half that many, split into two checkpoints. Since you&apos;ve already checked in from home, this is the only line you&apos;ll have to stand in.&quot;</p>

They promise more options than the current terminal, in addition to flat screen TVs and WiFi (we just hope their WiFi works, as it rarely does in their hotspots now). </p>

<p><strong>The Baggage Claim:</strong> For those arriving in the new digs, you&apos;ll be welcomed with open arms and &quot;six massive luggage carousels.&quot; That&apos;s two more than now.</p>

<p>And then of course there are the gates, of which there will be 26 versus the current 21. JetBlue announced their T5 takeover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062214/http://gothamist.com/2004/08/05/new_terminal_and_restored_terminal_5_for_jfk.php">in 2004</a>, prior to kicking out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062214/http://gothamist.com/2004/10/06/terminal_five_terminated_for_now.php">the Terminal 5 art exhibit</a> from their new space. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062214/http://www.jetblue.com/about/jfk/t5.html">Their website</a> currently states that they will be able to &quot;support 500 daily departures and arrivals, doubling our current operating capacity at JFK.&quot; </p>
