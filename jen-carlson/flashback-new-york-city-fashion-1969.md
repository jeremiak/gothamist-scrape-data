</div></div>					<p>During the summer of 1969, photographer Vernon Merritt III strolled around New York City documenting the fashion of the time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235015/http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/47581/new-york-city-summer-of-69">for LIFE magazine</a>. At the time, Merritt said: &quot;New Yorkers have such charm, savoir faire, call it what you will. And it&apos;s a general thing&#x2014;all the way from Harlem down to the Battery.&quot; His focus was mostly on the younger set, noting &quot;New York City is a costume party for the young this summer, a party that is taking place outdoors, on the streets and in the parks.&quot;</p>

<p>The photographer hailed from Alabama, and upon seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235015/http://www.life.com/image/92922159/in-gallery/47581/new-york-city-summer-of-69">this trash-filled alley</a> said, &quot;At one point, about midway through the story, I began to think that New York might really be a nifty place to live, that the redeeming features outweighed all the drawbacks. Then I realized I was reacting more to the people I was photographing than to the city itself.&quot; Oh well, it&apos;s cleaner now, and just as nifty.</p>
