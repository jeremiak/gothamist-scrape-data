</div></div>					<p>Just in time for summer: the snow leopards are here! Coming straight from the Bronx, the big cats have been getting some spotlight regarding their move to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519214836/http://www.centralparkzoo.com/look-and-learn/headlines/big-cats-big-city.aspx">Central Park Zoo</a>, who will open their new Allison Maher Stern Snow Leopard Exhibit tomorrow. </p>

<p>Earlier today some school children from the five boroughs were invited to take a sneak peek at Manhattan&apos;s first ever snow leopards. The Wildlife Conservation Society says, &#x201C;We hope that all who visit this exhibit will be inspired to join our efforts to help save these animals and other rare species around the world.&#x201D; Currently there are an estimated few thousand of these cats in the wild, with 700 in captivity (3 at the Central Park Zoo). Upon their move to Manhattan, the trio were given new names&#x2014;learn more about Bo, Zoe and Chocolate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519214836/http://www.centralpark.com/pages/central-park-zoo/snow-leopard.html">here</a>.</p>
