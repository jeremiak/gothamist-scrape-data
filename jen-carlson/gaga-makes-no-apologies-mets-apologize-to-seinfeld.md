										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:175px; "> <img alt="gagametsgame.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130027im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gagametsgame.jpg" width="175" height="266"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">via the AP</span></i></div> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130027/http://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/15943291087">The Lady has spoken</a>, and she says: &quot;A middle finger is more New York than a corporate ambush.&quot; This is, of course, in regards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130027/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/11/lady_gaga_loses_it_at_mets_game.php">to Lady Gaga</a>, who drew attention away from the Mets last night at Citi Field when she stripped down to her sparkly unmentionables, made out with a girl, flipped the bird, and yelled obscenities. <p></p>

<p>She continued today&apos;s Tweet declaring: &quot;I bleed for my hometown&quot; (that is, as long as her hometown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130027/http://soundshore.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/24/lady-gaga-im-not-from-westchester/">isn&apos;t Yonkers</a>). She also said she&apos;d &quot;die&quot; for her fans... which is very sweet and all, but apparently she <em>is</em> willing to disrespect the fans of her hometown&apos;s baseball team. Then again, she&apos;s a Yankees fan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529130027/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/06/exclusive-new-york-mets-apologize-jerry-seinfeld-after-giving-his-seats-lady-gaga">to RadarOnline</a>, the Mets have now apologized to Jerry Seinfeld, whose suite Gaga escaped to, saying: &quot;We deeply regret that Jerry Seinfeld has been associated with this matter. The use of Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s suite was unauthorized and unknown to him at the time. We made a quick decision to place Lady Gaga and her group in a private suite because of issues related to her visit.&#x201D;</p>
