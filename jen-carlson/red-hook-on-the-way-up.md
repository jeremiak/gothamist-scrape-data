Red Hook would definitely fall into that category.&quot;</strong> Of course, the artists are being credited for the rejuvenated hood, but so are the Fairway, IKEA, water taxi service, and others. Residents still say it&apos;s not for everyone (read: they want to keep it a secret), with one comparing its diamond-in-the-rough status to &quot;a hot chick in overalls.&quot; Meanwhile, a Corcoran realtor warns that housing prices will continue to go up in the neighborhood, because even if there&apos;s still no subway stop, there&apos;s plenty of space.</p>
