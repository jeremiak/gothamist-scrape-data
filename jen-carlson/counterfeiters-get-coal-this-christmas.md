<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106231638/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11262007/news/regionalnews/bootleg_biz_feeling_pinch_515470.htm">The NY Post</a> reports that cops are paying extra-special attention to the counterfeiters this year, leading to a big decline in sales for the sidewalk entrepreneurs and aiming the consumers to (gasp!) legit storefronts.</p><blockquote>That&apos;s great news for legitimate shop owners, who argue that the fly-by-night peddlers should be tossed in jail for routinely breaking the law by hawking knockoff handbags, watches, perfumes and the like.<p></p>

<p>&quot;This holiday season looks really bad,&quot; moaned John Blattle, 52, who sells watches off a folding table on West 34th Street. &quot;A lot of people were looking, but nobody was buying. It&apos;s really disappointing because all my money is tied up in this.&quot;</p></blockquote>Not only is there less money coming in, there&apos;s more risk for people like Blattle, who now have to watch out for the bulked up task force set up to &quot;keep tabs on peddlers this season.&quot; Unsurprisingly, the most watched areas are those that are tourist-heavy: Times Square, Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center and Herald Square. But fear not, if you really want that knock-off there are licensed peddlers out there. <p></p>
