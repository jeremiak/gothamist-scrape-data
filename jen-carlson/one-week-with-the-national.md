Think the touring life of a Brooklyn band is glamorous? Okay, you probably don&apos;t. But check out &quot;One Week with The National&quot;, a documentary on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108095532/http://americanmary.com/">the band</a> which comes in three parts on YouTube (first of which is above) and is also available on iTunes. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108095532/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_82cN7b34Qw">Part two</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108095532/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjlcf1CoEGQ">three</a> on YouTube). It&apos;s an interesting insider look at life and various struggles on the road. 

</p><p>We&apos;ve loved this band for a few years now, and still think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108095532/http://www.amazon.com/Alligator-National/dp/B0007LCNKM"><em>Alligator</em></a> is one of the best albums to come out in those past few years. If you haven&apos;t heard them, the documenatary serves as a fitting intro to the band - though we suggest getting your hands on that cd, as well.</p>

<p>Drummer, Bryan Devendorf, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108095532/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/03/25/dear_sxsw_diarypart_2.php">kept a tour diary for us</a> in early 2005 - just a few months before this documentary was filmed. </p>
