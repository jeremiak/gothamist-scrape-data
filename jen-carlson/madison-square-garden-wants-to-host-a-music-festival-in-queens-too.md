<p>While NYC has been a bit of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406055535/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/festival_fail.php">musical festival desert</a> in the past, the independent company behind Governors Ball found a way to make it work. And now that they&apos;ve hit their stride, creating a workable business model that has succeeded in the city, bigger companies are coming in and threatening their existence. </p>

<p>Last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406055535/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/30/coachella_nyc_panorama.php">it was announced</a> that AEG Live, the company behind Coachella, was eyeing June 2016 to host their own East Coast version of the fest at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, just 2 weeks before Governors Ball (which takes place on Randall&apos;s Island). And now, Madison Square Garden wants to do the same&#x2014;they&apos;re also eyeing Flushing Meadows Corona Park. </p>

<p>Did no one know about Flushing Meadows Corona Park before now? </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406055535/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/msg-proposes-coachella-like-festival-queens-article-1.2420740">the Daily News</a>, yesterday &quot;MSG applied to host a three-day festival... looking to bring big name artists to Flushing Meadows Corona Park. In a statement,  David O&apos;Connor, CEO of the Madison Square Garden Company, declared: &quot;There&apos;s no one as committed to, or more capable of, creating a world-class festival than we are.&quot; Well, except for Governors Ball and AEG. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the Madison Square Garden Company to find out what types of bands they are looking to book, and will update if we hear back&#x2014;both Governors Ball and AEG have similar lineups in mind.</p>

<p>It&apos;s all in the hands of the New York City Parks Department, which is reviewing the most recent applications, but if everyone&apos;s fests go through, here&apos;s what we&apos;re looking at: </p>

<p>June 3 to 5: Governors Ball on Randall&apos;s Island<br>
June 17 to 19: Panorama Fest (AEG&apos;s festival) at Flushing Meadows Corona Park<br>
June 24 to 26: MSG&apos;s fest at Flushing Meadows Corona Park</p>

<p>Governors Ball has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406055535/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/governors_ball_vs_aeg_live.php">petitioning to stop AEG</a>, and we reached out to them for comment on the MSG news. Tom Russell told us, &quot;New York City is a world class venue for large outdoor events. Our only interest is that the city pursue a strategy that allows all festivals to flourish in order to maximize the benefits to taxpayers, communities and music fans.&quot;</p>

<p>While more festivals in NYC is a great thing, placing them all in the same month is bad idea&#x2014;it creates competition for booking, and also forces many music fans to choose just one due to monetary (and energy level!) concerns.</p>
