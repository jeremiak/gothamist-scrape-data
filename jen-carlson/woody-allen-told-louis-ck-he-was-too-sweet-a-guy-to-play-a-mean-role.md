In this week&apos;s interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002527/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/arts/for-louis-c-k-the-jokes-on-him.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">the NY Times</a>, he tells Dave Itzkoff about <em>Louie</em>, the special, working with David Lynch, and delivers this charming anecdote about how he got involved in Woody Allen&apos;s upcoming film, <em>Blue Jasmine</em>.<p></p>

<blockquote><strong>So how did Woody Allen approach you?</strong> It just came out of nowhere. I got this e-mail: Woody Allen wants you to come in for something. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for that e-mail my whole life. I&#x2019;m not going to pretend I&#x2019;m above that. I went into his office and read for a part that Andrew Dice Clay ended up getting. Woody said: &#x201C;I know you can act. I just don&#x2019;t know if this is the kind of guy that you are. This is a very mean guy, and you&#x2019;re not a mean guy.&#x201D;

<p>And I read it, and I was like, yeah, I&#x2019;m not getting the part. I can be working class. I can&#x2019;t hit my wife. So I&#x2019;ll talk the way I would say these things and I won&#x2019;t get the part, but I&#x2019;ll leave with my head up high. And that&#x2019;s precisely what happened. But I was very emotional, because I had just met Woody and he was very kind to me.</p>

<p>Two weeks later I was told, &#x201C;His assistant is bringing something to your apartment.&#x201D; It was some pages from the script and a letter from him. And it said: &#x201C;You were too sweet a guy to do the other one, but this is one you could do. If you don&#x2019;t want to do this, we&#x2019;ll do something, someday.&#x201D; So I read the lines, I was laughing out loud. So I hand-wrote him a letter saying unequivocally yes, and sent it off.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Doesn&apos;t it just make you feel good to know people this sweet can find success in this world of wickedness and deceit? </p>
