<p>How did this idea only just make it to major retailers? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150103/http://www.stylelist.com/2011/07/21/mad-men-costume-designer-janie-bryant-banana-republic/#photo-9">Stylelist</a>, Banana Republic will be introducing a new line next month inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150103/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, and they even got AMC&apos;s costume designer, Janie Bryant, to help them create the 65-piece collection. But it seems the retail version of Joan Holloway is missing a little something, no?</p>

<p>Bryant told them, &quot;Each character on the show has their own silhouette and inspiration for their look. We recreated modern silhouettes for Joan, Peggy and Betty which range from body conscious to A-line. We adapted the silhouettes and color palettes to be more adaptable to the modern women&quot;&#x2014;and apparently their modern woman doesn&apos;t have a curve on her body. What would the men of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce think of this!</p>
