title: Jude Law Gets Schooled in Privacy By NYU Freshman
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="judelaw1109.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130528233933im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/judelaw1109.jpg" width="239" height="264" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s hard to feel bad for Jude Law when we <em>all</em> lack privacy in the city &#x2014; in much less swank digs. Turns out the actor moved in right next to the NYU freshman dorm Hayden Hall, and the student body is enjoying their new view.</p>

<p>The dubious dorm dwellers have now leaked their secret to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130528233933/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/above_the_law_3nwa3ISW51QPLPlfSv3WGM">the NY Post</a> (with paparazzi style photos), saying whenever they spot Law on his Washington Square balcony (sometimes with his son), there&apos;s complete chaos. Their not-so-subtle tactics include binoculars, screaming, and noses to the window. One told the paper that when he comes out to do his yoga, &quot;People start screaming, &apos;Hey, Jude&apos; &#x2014; and it&apos;s clear he can hear us&quot;</p>

<p>But the once giddy undergrads are turning on the current star of Broadway&apos;s &quot;Hamlet.&quot; Allegedly a recent, innocent wave to the actor landed them a full-on citrus attack. Upon spotting his unwelcome audience he started hurling fruit at their windows, and one soured fan says: &quot;there was orange pulp on the glass for a week. Now we don&apos;t like Jude Law anymore.&quot; Watch out Mr. Law, one of them is coming to your show tomorrow night!</p>
