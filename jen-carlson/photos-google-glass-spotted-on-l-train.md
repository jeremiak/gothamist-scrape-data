<p>In the 1990s, or even the early aughts, one would have <em>never</em> worn their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221518/http://gothamist.com/tags/googleglass">Google Glass</a> out in public in New York City... in Brooklyn... <em>on the subway</em>, unless one wanted to be robbed blind. But in post-gentrification Williamsburg, it seems you can ride the L train at midnight while flaunting your Google Glass and not get mugged. If you just Googled this story while riding the train with your Google Glass, you&apos;re welcome for <em>blowing your mind.</em></p>

<p>But that doesn&apos;t mean the hi-tech straphanger won&apos;t become victim to curious onlookers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221518/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/13/google_glasses_spotted_in_the_east.php">we&apos;re guilty, too</a>)&#x2014;tipster Christina Martinelli sent in the above photos, telling us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I was on the L train Saturday night on my way from Brooklyn to Union square to see a 12:30 a.m. screening of <em>Jurassic Park</em> in 3D (so obviously the world was already full of magic) when my friends and I spotted this man with something odd around his neck sitting across from us. Just as we had guessed that they were Google Goggles [ed. note: Google <em>Glass</em>] this other guy realized the same thing and struck up a conversation with him. I couldn&apos;t hear everything they said but the stranger did say he was going to get himself a pair and then ask what it was they actually did, to which Google man replied &apos;Have you watched the video?&apos; Then the Google guy put on his Goggles [ed. note: GLASS!] and they awkwardly talked to each other like that for at least 30 minutes.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This was most likely another Google employee, though it&apos;s not co-founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221518/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/photo_google_co-founder_sports_proj.php">Sergey Brin</a>, and doesn&apos;t appear to be Joseph Smarr, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221518/http://www.seroundtable.com/photos/google-joseph-smarr-subway-glass-16612.html">who also recently brought them underground</a>. And for those keeping track, it won&apos;t be until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221518/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/a_peek_at_google_glass_nightmare_dy.php">later this year</a> (or next year, latest) until Google Glass becomes the hot new item to get mugged for. Move over, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231221518/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/dr_dre_headphones_are_the_new_must-.php">Beats by Dre</a>.</p>
