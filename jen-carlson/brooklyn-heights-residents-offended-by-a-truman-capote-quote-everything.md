By Choice.&quot; The quote is now being used on 78 directional signs in the borough to help tourists navigate Downtown Brooklyn, and some residents are taking it as a slap in the face!  According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174301/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/capote_wit_sits_badly_in_klyn_sPaa7e8kfQinuzozoS7c3O?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, at least. <p></p>

<p>One resident told the paper, &quot;I don&#x2019;t like the signs. It sounds like it was put up by someone who doesn&#x2019;t live here.&quot; Another chimed in, &quot;It&#x2019;s offensive. Before I asked and learned that [Capote] said it, I took it to mean that we live in Brooklyn because we can&#x2019;t afford Manhattan.&quot; Well, his 1959 &quot;House in the Heights&quot; essay also called Brooklyn, &quot;as a whole, an uninviting community.&quot;</p>

<p>Considering the Metro Tech Business Improvement District shelled out $1.4 million for the signage plan, you can <em>fuggedaboutit</em> coming down.</p>
