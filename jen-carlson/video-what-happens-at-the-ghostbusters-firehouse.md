										<p>Want to know what it&apos;s like on an average day at Hook &amp; Ladder 8? Here&apos;s a cute parody (actually a PSA commercial from Volkswagen), complete with &quot;Who You Gonna Call?&quot; mugs, tourists asking to slide down the poll, and a cameo by the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man!</p>

<p>If you head over there in real life, you can expect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140927060922/http://www.bigwaste.com/photos/ny/ghostbusters/firehouse.shtml">friendly firemen</a>... but no pole sliding.
