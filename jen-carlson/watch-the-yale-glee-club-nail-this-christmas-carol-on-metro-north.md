<p>In a refreshing change, today we have been delivered some feel good footage from inside of a train car. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033509/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">No bad etiquette</a>, nothing awful that will make you lose your faith in humanity, just some gleeful singing that would probably only annoy <em>some</em> of the train passengers. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033509/https://www.facebook.com/bob.mcdonough.56/videos/vb.1062972418/10206629696635431/?type=2&amp;theater">On Facebook</a>, MetroNorth conductor Bob McDonough posted the above video, and explained that he had the Yale Glee Club on his train last week.</p>

<blockquote>Not only did I have &quot;The Yale Glee Club&quot; riding my train into NYC on Friday, but later that night they were on my train back home to New Haven. I told them I was a conductor, so I must conduct... and somehow they bought it. Did I mention they go to YALE? Thank you to Greg Suralik (class of &apos;17) and Nolan Crawford, for recording and emailing your videos to me.</blockquote>

<p>According <a href="www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Yale-Glee-Club-Sings-Metro-North-Train-Conductor-Grand-Central-New-York-City-New-Haven-360871761.html">to NBC</a>, they also performed on the platform on Grand Central. Click play and enjoy this nice moment in human interaction, and some &quot;Carol of the Bells.&quot;</p>
