<p>A 14-year-old girl is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035408/http://www.change.org/petitions/seventeen-magazine-give-girls-images-of-real-girls">currently battling</a> an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035408/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_manipulation#History">age-old problem</a>: photo manipulation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035408/http://www.sparksummit.com/2012/05/01/sign-spoof-and-sparkd-to-celebrate-seventeen-petition/">Julia Bluhm</a> has petitioned for Seventeen magazine to &quot;commit to printing one unaltered&#x2014;real&#x2014;photo spread per month,&quot; noting that &quot;girls want to be accepted, appreciated and liked. And when they don&apos;t fit the criteria, some girls like to fix themselves. This can lead to eating disorders, dieting, depression and low self-esteem.&quot; And now her battle is coming to the streets New York City.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve received a press release that Seventeen magazine readers, including Bluhm, will demonstrate outside of the magazine&#x2019;s headquarters tomorrow at 11 a.m., delivering the petition to the powers that be inside of Hearst Tower. It&apos;s been signed by 13,000 people. The group will also compose a mock photo shoot. We&apos;re told, &quot;Teenagers will take photos in front of a backdrop outside Seventeen&#x2019;s headquarters holding dry erase boards with handwritten messages to Seventeen on them.&quot;</p>

<p>Bluhm says, &#x201C;Seventeen Magazine is supposed to be a relatable magazine, right? How can we relate to computer altered photos?&#x201D; At this time Seventeen hasn&apos;t commented.</p>
