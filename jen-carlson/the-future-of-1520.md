<p><img alt="2007_07_arts_1520.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811104550im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_07_arts_1520.jpg" width="345" height="326" class="right">A while back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811104550/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/21/hip_hop.php">we reported on possible changes at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue</a> in the Bronx, more widely known as &quot;the birthplace of hip hop.&quot; Tenants of the apartment complex, as well as its supporters, have been fighting to get the building landmarked. Just as important, they want to keep the apartments rent stabilized. </p>

<p>At 9:30 this morning DJ Kool Herc, who is credited with inventing the genre in the building&apos;s rec room, rallied the troops to draw attention to the cause. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811104550/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=112&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=26812">The press conference</a> announced that the New York State Office of Parks Recreation and Historic Preservation approved a July 2nd application to make the building eligible as an historic landmark, citing it &quot;meets the eligibility criteria being that it is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history.&quot; </p>

<p>The event this morning (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811104550/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2007/07/will_hiphop_landmark_be_saved.html">Senator Chuck Schumer attended</a>) was held to celebrate that fact, but also to draw attention to the looming issue of protecting the building&apos;s affordable housing status. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811104550/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/am-hiphop0723,0,216154.story?coll=ny-entertainment-headlines">Newsday</a> reports:</p>

<blockquote>The DJ [Kool Herc] moved with his Caribbean immigrant family into the building when it first opened in 1970. Designed for middle-income families, rents were regulated under the Mitchell-Lama housing program.

<p>But after a 20-year limit expired, the building&apos;s owners are allowed to buy the property out of the program. Tenants got a letter in February saying the owner, BRS management, planned to do just that, residents said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There is still work to be done to prevent its owners from converting the property to house market-rate rentals, but for now the future of the past is looking a little brighter, despite the rainy rally earlier.  </p>
