While skimming through some of the sites of the shops that were recommended, we came across a few NYC themed tattoos. Skylines, good/evil Statue of Liberty&apos;s, the Empire State Building...</p>

<p>We also found a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140146/http://www.passionrose.com/images/tattoo/NYCPostcard.jpg">Greetings From New York City tattoo</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140146/http://news.newstimeslive.com/photos/2006-03-06/0222cw05.jpg">Yankees logo tattoo</a> and many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706140146/http://www.bravestmemorial.com/gif/art/art_tattoo_cassidy_tiernach.jpg">9/11 memorial tattoos</a>. Have you seen any pieces of the city inked on to anyone lately?
