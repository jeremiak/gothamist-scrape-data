<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184324/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/lena_dunham_interview_1.php">we talked to Lena Dunham</a> last year before her show <em>Girls</em> was set to premiere on HBO, she discussed the importance of New York City geography and locations, noting, &quot;I was literally looking at a map of Brooklyn when I was writing.&quot; The production shoots all over New York, often using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184324/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/09/lena_dunham_girls_guide_to_going_ou.php">real locations</a> that tend to be more on the indie side, and in last night&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184324/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/11/girls_season_2.php">second season premiere</a>, the real life highlight was Williamsburg&apos;s Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown bookstore on Bedford Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184324/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/09/best_bookstores_of_nyc.php#photo-10">home of the best bookstore cat in NYC</a>. Depending on if your DIY terrarium is half full or half empty, this could mean that <em>Girls</em> will either save your favorite smaller businesses from shuttering, or it will <em>ruin them for you</em>, possibly both...</p>

<p>Remember when <em>Sex and the City</em> fans were flocking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184324/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/25/no_more_stoop_on_the_sex_tour.php">to Carrie&apos;s stoop</a> and different locations that showed up on in the series? <em>Remember what it did to Magnolia Bakery?</em> Well word is that <em>Girls</em> is getting its own bus tour. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184324/http://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/next-step-to-girls-world-domination-a-tour-bus">On Location Tours</a> is in the &quot;very beginning stages&quot; of developing what will most likely be a Brooklyn-centric tour, bussing tourists and fans around to places like Cafe Grumpy and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184324/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=45+bushwick+place+brooklyn&amp;ll=40.706474,-73.938063&amp;spn=0.006067,0.012918&amp;sll=40.706959,-73.938710&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,183.16,,0,5.3&amp;cbll=40.707015,-73.938705&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=45+Bushwick+Pl,+Brooklyn,+New+York+11206&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;panoid=77F7gL_RzWwnOrah7TvLgA">45 Bushwick Place</a>.</p>

<p>As for Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown, we&apos;ve contacted the bookstore to find out what their experience was like, why the cat didn&apos;t get any screen time, and if they&apos;re stocking up on <em>The Fountainhead</em>, which also made a cameo in last night&apos;s episode. We&apos;ll update when, and if, we hear back.</p>
