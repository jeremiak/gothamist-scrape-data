</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013041/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/wld/">World&#x2019;s Largest Dinosaurs</a> have arrived in Manhattan, and they&apos;re so big that they&apos;re hitting their heads on the American Museum of Natural History&apos;s drop ceilings! This Saturday (through January 2nd, 2012) the museum will become home to the colossal creatures, at an installation they say goes beyond traditional fossil shows. The goal is &quot;to reveal how dinosaurs actually lived, by taking visitors into the amazing anatomy of a uniquely super-sized group of dinosaurs: the long-necked and long-tailed sauropods, which ranged in size from 15 to 150 feet long.&quot;</p>

<p>The installation is filled with interactive exhibits, including a life-sized, fleshed-out model of a 60-foot-long, 11-foot-tall female Mamenchisaurus, with a 30-foot neck. The museum says they &quot;will take visitors inside these giants&#x2019; bodies, shedding light on how heart rate, respiration, metabolism, and reproduction are linked to size. An interactive excavation at the end of the exhibition will introduce visitors to how dinosaurs are discovered in the field through a replicated dig site.&quot; </p>

<p>Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013041/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> dropped by yesterday for a sneak peek, and while there learned that (spoiler alert!) sauropods needed to eat 100,000 calories a day! That is <em>a lot</em> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013041/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/shake_shacks_calorie_counts_now_onl.php">Shake Shack</a>.</p>
