If you haven&apos;t heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805033523/http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</a> by now (or haven&apos;t seen this photo which has accompanied pretty much all of their press), then you must be reading this from the past. Sometime in early &apos;04 perhaps. Let&apos;s hope so at least, because this band has been stockpiling buzz from every credible source in this fair city and beyond for months now. They are on the verge of something big. 

</p><p>The sound is one that certainly channels David Byrne, but a bit more melodic and with a more subdued anxious tick. The Talking Heads comparison is overused when describing them, but with good reason, they all come from the art school of rock. Similar roots, different branches. </p>

<p>You know, sometimes we just want to say things like: this band is just really f-ing good. </p>

<p>And if that&apos;s not enough, just yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805033523/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/tracks/05-06-14.shtml">Pitchfork</a> compared their songcrafting to the Arcade Fire, so you know - once that album gets reviewed it&apos;s getting a pretty good score. Check them out at our Movable Hype show on Monday the 20th [more details after the interview].</p>

<p>CYHSY are Alec Ounsworth, Lee Sargent, Robbie Guertin, Tyler Sargent, and Sean Greenhalgh. This week they took some time to answer our questions. Most of their answers are shorter than their band name. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
AO:  The name was uttered by The Great Fish Claude shortly before expiring atop the mighty Schuylkill river.</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
LS: Hearing a different kind of loud sex next door and wondering whether to call the EPA or go downstairs to unload the truck. I<br>
unloaded the truck.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York?</strong><br>
LS: The blackout was ok  / All winters ever.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out?</strong><br>
AO:  Deep in the woods of Prospect Park.  Tuesdays.</p>
