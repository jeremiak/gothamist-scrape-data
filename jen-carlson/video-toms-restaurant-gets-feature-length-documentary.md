<p>There&apos;s more to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072639/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/the_best_diners_in_new_york_city.php">Tom&apos;s Restaurant</a> than <em>Seinfeld</em> and that Suzanne Vega song, as filmmaker Gian Franco Morini set out to prove in his film about the Morningside Heights staple. He tells us, &quot;My documentary explores all the pop culture references and the owners and clientele... people from all walks of life: from the philosopher Cornel West and the students and professors from Columbia University (such as the deeply lovable David Sidorsky PHD&#x2014;who taught at CU for more than 50 years).&quot; You&apos;ll also hear musicians like the self-proclaimed &quot;grandfather of rap&quot; Burton Crane, as well as recovering crack addict Cristopher Olivier. There&apos;s even a local regular who was the original guitar player for Letterman, and acted in <em>Fire Walk With Me</em>, <em>Animal House</em>, AND <em>Deep Throat</em>! </p>

<p>And of course you&apos;ll meet Mike Zoulis, owner/manager of Tom&apos;s since the &apos;80s, who will dig up &quot;untold stories about the first and final days of <em>Seinfeld</em>, their relationships with the cast members, and Suzanne Vega.&quot; It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072639/http://www.tomsrestaurantdocumentary.com/">a documentary of <strike>nothing</strike> everything</a>, and it&apos;ll be out next year&#x2014;for now, here&apos;s a trailer:</p>
