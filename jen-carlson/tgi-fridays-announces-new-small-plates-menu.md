<p>TGI Friday&apos;s is finally catching up with this small plates trend that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155214/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/27/todd_barry_gives_advice_on_first_da.php">so hot on Staten Island</a>, and have just introduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155214/http://www.tgifridays.com/greatfood#taste-and-share">a new Taste &amp; Share menu</a>. It&apos;s like tapas but less Spanish and more fried and with a touch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155214/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0224230/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Mrs. Flax</a> in <em>Mermaids</em> flair:</p>

<p>Through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155214/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases-test/tgi-fridayssm-unveils-new-taste--share-menu-204480621.html#prettyPhoto">their press release</a>, they announce the menu will feature &quot;seven perfectly-sized, lower-priced selections that are great for splitting with friends and trying a bit of everything.&quot; But listen, no one can <em>make you share</em>:</p>

Friday&apos;s&#xAE; (@TGIFridays) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155214/https://twitter.com/TGIFridays/status/327118031186714625">April 24, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>The offerings will feature &quot;exciting flavor combinations&quot; to be paired with <em>not a nice vino espa&#xF1;ol</em> but &quot;a new selection of regional craft beers and three new innovative scratch-made cocktails mixed and muddled by the best bartenders in the business.&quot; What goes better with your small plate of Bacon Mac &amp; Cheese Bites than a Barbados Rum Punch?</p>

<p>Other menu items include: Thai Pork Tacos, Ahi Tuna Crisps, Corned Beef &amp; Swiss Sliders, Garlic &amp; Basil Bruschetta, Parmesan Meatballs, and Hibachi Skewers.</p>
