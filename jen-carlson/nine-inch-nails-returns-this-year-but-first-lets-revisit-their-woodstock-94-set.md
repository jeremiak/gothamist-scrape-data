										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="reznor0213.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214194048im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/reznor0213.jpg" width="350" height="257" class="image-right"> </span>Today Trent Reznor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214194048/http://stereogum.com/1269592/nine-inch-nails-to-tour-this-year/news/">confirmed</a> that Nine Inch Nails would return this year with a tour, a new lineup, and what may be some big changes from the Nine Inch Nails of your teen-angsty youth. He explained:</p><blockquote>&quot;I was working with Adrian Belew [ed. note: yes, from King Crimson] on some musical ideas, which led to some discussion on performing, which led to some beard-scratching, which (many steps later) led to the decision to re-think the idea of what Nine Inch Nails could be, and the idea of playing a show. Calls were made to some friends, lots of new ideas were discussed, and a show was booked&#x2014;which led to another, which somehow led to a lot of shows.<p></p>

<p>The band is reinventing itself from scratch and will be comprised of Eric Avery, Adrian Belew, Alessandro Cortini, Josh Eustis, Ilan Rubin, and me. The first shows will begin this summer, followed by a full-on arena tour of the US this fall, and lots of other dates worldwide to follow through 2014. Lots of details and dates to come. See you soon. &#x2014;&#xA0;TR&quot;</p></blockquote>Since this is all sort of wait and see, for now let&apos;s revisit the band when it played Woodstock &apos;94. This is probably exactly what Reznor <em>doesn&apos;t</em> want us to do, but a screaming-into-the-void Reznor covered in mud is like our kryptonite.<p></p>
