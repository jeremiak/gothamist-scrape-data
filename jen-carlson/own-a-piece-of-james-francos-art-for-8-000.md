<p>For four days, starting next Friday (the 4th), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528125433/http://www.rxart.net/">RxArt</a> will host a Pop-Up Shop at 208 Forsyth Street, selling works by everyone from Terence Koh to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528125433/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> (rhyming!). They tell us, &quot;a rotating installation of works will be available to purchase over the Shop&#x2019;s duration.  Check in daily to view works by Will Cotton, Todd Eberle, Chris Johanson, Odilon Redon, Haim Steinbach, William Wegman, Matthew Brannon, Lawrence Weiner, and several others.&quot; </p>

<p>The available art will include six pieces by Franco, each a framed set of five Polaroids&#x2014;the above is a close-up of a piece titled &quot;Asheville #3.&quot; If you want to buy them, however, bring some bankrolls... each one is going for $8,000!	</p>

<p>The non-profit places fine art in hospitals, and all proceeds from the Shop will help fund their projects and mission to improve otherwise sterile healthcare environments. The shop will also offer less expensive items, like coloring books, and will be opened from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except for Sunday when it will open at noon.</p>
