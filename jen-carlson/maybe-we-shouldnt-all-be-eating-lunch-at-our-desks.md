<p>It&apos;s so lovely out, and yet here we are ordering lunch through the few clicks of a button on our computer, which we will continue to stare at even as we eat said lunch. But hey, maybe that is not a good idea! Maybe we should all jack out of the Matrix sometimes and enjoy some human interaction or a good stare at the sky or maybe we should disconnect and just <em>be</em>.</p>

<p>Author Bob Pozen has shared some tips on office lunching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162349/http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/stop-eating-lunch-at-your-desk.html">over at Inc.</a>, where they say &quot;eating at your desk may make you less productive rather than more.&quot;  Pozen suggests eating alone to &quot;help restore your personal resources.&quot; And he means <em>really alone</em>, no iPhone or screens of any kind. Why? &quot;An absence of stimulation encourages associative or integrative thought, spurring your creativity.&quot;</p>

<p>Plus, a quick glance at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162349/http://saddesklunch.com/">Sad Desk Lunch</a> Tumblr proves it is just freaking <em>depressing</em>. In the end, when you look back on your life, is it going to look like an endless scroll of that Tumblr?</p>

<p>P.S. Also try eating your lunch standing up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162349/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/29/the_truth_about_sitting_down_its_ki.php">since all that sitting is slowly murdering you</a>.</p>
