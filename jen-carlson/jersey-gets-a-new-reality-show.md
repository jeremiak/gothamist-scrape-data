<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="jerseys0310.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123038im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jerseys0310.jpg" width="350" height="219"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Snooki and Olivia: separated at birth?</span></i></div> Now that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123038/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> cast has moved out of their humble boardwalk abode to film in Miami this summer, another network is readying to capitalize off the success of the state. <p></p>

<p>The Style Network&apos;s new reality series (premiering Sunday at 10 p.m.) is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123038/http://www.mystyle.com/mystyle/shows/jerseylicious/index.jsp"><em>Jerseylicious</em></a> and will star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123038/http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/movies/first-peek-at-jerseylicious-cast-olivia-blois-sharpe">Olivia Blois Sharpe</a>, who told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123038/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/03/16/2010-03-16_get_a_real_dose_of_jersey_from_styles_new_reality_series_jerseylicious_.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;Real Jersey girls are a lot more fashion-forward. Those [<em>Jersey Shore</em>] girls were in their sweatpants all the time, their hair wasn&apos;t done, their makeup wasn&apos;t done.&quot; But isn&apos;t that part of the Snooki appeal? If the MTV cast mates were a little trashy, Sharpe says her crew is &quot;a lot more flashy.&quot;</p>

<p>The show is set in Green Brook, N.J., where Sharpe is a makeup artist at the Gatsby Salon (fancy!), where her ex-boyfriend&apos;s new girlfriend also <strike>was cast</strike>works. She says while the <em>Jersey Shore</em> guidos and guidettes were all about partying, &quot;our main priority is our job.&quot; But... but... in the first episode Sharpe is late to her interview after partying all night! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123038/http://www.hulu.com/watch/133819/jerseylicious-bonus-working-girl">Watch some clips here</a>, and tell us if you think these two girls pictured are really <em>that</em> different.</p>
