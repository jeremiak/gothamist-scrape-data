<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111503/http://gothamist.com/tags/fourseasons">Four Seasons</a>&#x2014;which opened in 1959 on Park Avenue&#x2014;will be losing some of its old school charm as new owners take over. It was announced this week that Wright Auctions will be overseeing the sale of their historic furniture and interior design features&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111503/http://www.wright20.com/pages/the-four-seasons">the auction</a> will take place inside Four Seasons (which is located inside of the landmark Seagram Buliding). A public preview will run from July 20th until the auction date of July 26th.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111503/http://www.curbed.com/2016/4/27/11518580/four-seasons-restaurant-design-auction-wright-auctions">Curbed</a> notes that &quot;the restaurant is a landmark of the Modernism and the International style, and one of the most celebrated examples of midcentury interior design. All designs from the restaurant will be offered for sale, minus architectural detailing and fittings that have been landmarked, such as the iconic metal curtains.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1989, when the Landmark Preservation Commission was tasked with whether or not the interior of the restaurant could be landmarked, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111503/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/30/realestate/streetscapes-the-four-seasons-serving-up-a-restaurant-for-landmark-designation.html">the NY Times</a> reported on some of its significant design holdings.</p>

<blockquote>Garth and Ada Louise Huxtable&#x2014;he was the industrial designer who died earlier this month, she is an architectural critic&#x2014;designed the table settings and some of the furniture was based on designs of the 1920&apos;s by Mr. van der Rohe. The completed Four Seasons was cool, elegant and modern, an unspoken rebuke to the overstuffed French restaurants that dominated first-class cuisine at the time. It has come to be one of the most important restaurants in New York.</blockquote>

<p>A full list has not yet been released, but items on the block <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111503/http://archpaper.com/2016/04/four-seasons-interior-furniture-decor-auction/#gallery-0-slide-0">include</a>: The Grill Room&#x2019;s banquettes; All furniture including the original suite of Barcelona seating from the travertine lobby; Custom Tulip tables with polished bronze tops; Groups of custom Brno chairs; Tableware; Objects such as custom wine coolers, planters, serving carts, and bespoke pots and pans. </p>

<p>Presumably the iconic pool will be staying.</p>
