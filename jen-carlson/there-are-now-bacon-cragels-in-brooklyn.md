<p>We recently learned of the latest hyped-up hybrid: the croissant-bagel. While Stew Leonard&apos;s calls theirs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522151841/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/are_you_ready_for_the_croissant-bag.php">the Crogel</a> (which is more croissant than bagel), Williamsburg&apos;s Bagel Store has dubbed theirs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522151841/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/hello_cragel.php">the Cragel</a> (which is more bagel than croissant). While they previously sold just one version of their creation, the store&apos;s Ross Helrich told us this morning that four new flavors have been introduced.</p>

<p>You can now get a Cragel in plain, cinnamon, spinach and parm, chocolate, and bacon/egg/cheddar. They also promise a fifth flavor on February 1st, but won&apos;t reveal it until 8:30 that morning. Cronut-Cragel?</p>

<p>Speaking of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522151841/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">Cronuts</a>, Dominique Ansel told us that he won&apos;t be jumping on the Cra/ogel bandwagon, saying, &quot;It&apos;s not about inventing the next &apos;hybrid pastry.&apos; It&apos;s just about making good pastries. Period.&quot;</p>
