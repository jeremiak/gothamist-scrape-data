<p>While NASA still hasn&apos;t made an official announcement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413213314/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/space-shuttle-to-land-in-manhattan/">sources say</a> that the Shuttle Enterprise will be landing in New York City! It&apos;s final trip will have it landing on the deck of the Intrepid (okay, so it will probably be towed there), where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413213314/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/11/countdown_to_nasas_space_shuttle_an.php">later today</a> they&apos;ll be screening the official announcement on a 40-foot wall.</p>

<p>The exciting news comes after months and months of lobbying for a shuttle... but why did we get the shuttle <em>that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413213314/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Enterprise">isn&apos;t even capable of flight</a></em>, and has never orbited space?! On the upside, in 1976 it <em>was</em> greeted by the cast members from the <em>Star Trek</em> television series. So that&apos;s... something.</p>
