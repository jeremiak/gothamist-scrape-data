In the interview he discussed his crime with the parole board, and noted of his shooting John Lennon: <strong>&quot;I don&apos;t recall saying: Mr. Lennon. I think that was something that the press elaborated on; that did not happen, he didn&apos;t turn I shot him in the back.&quot;</strong> He continued on, saying he&apos;s changed, apologizing to Lennon&apos;s family and noting that if released he would go work on a farm upstate, where a man had offered him a job. The board decided to keep him locked up, of course--and as Yoko Ono said herself, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125045952/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/12/yoko_ono_says_chapman_is_safer_in_j.php">he&apos;s &quot;safer&quot; in jail.</a></p>
