<p>Over the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818120621/https://twitter.com/PearlJam/status/353204032107593731">Pearl Jam Tweeted</a>, &quot;Are you ready?&quot; with a link to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818120621/http://pearljam.com/countdown">this countdown page</a>, which stopped at 1 p.m. EST today. Unfortunately, once the clock hit 1 we weren&apos;t all transported back to 1991 in our flannels and boots to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818120621/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/video_watch_pearl_jam_play_at_a_yon.php">see the band play Tower Records</a>, this was all just a hyped up tour announcement. But that&apos;s fine! Pearl Jam 4eva! Etc. </p>

<p>The band (who also reportedly have a new song coming out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818120621/http://news.revolt.tv/new-pearl-jam-single-mind-your-manners/">very soon</a>) will kick off their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818120621/http://pearljam.com/tour">tour in October</a>, and will hit Brooklyn&apos;s Barclays Center on the 18th and 19th of that month (tickets are not on sale yet). Until then, listen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818120621/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/21/courtney_love_talks.php">Courtney Love</a> singing some of &quot;Alive&quot; to us, and discussing bands from the &apos;90s touring now:</p>
