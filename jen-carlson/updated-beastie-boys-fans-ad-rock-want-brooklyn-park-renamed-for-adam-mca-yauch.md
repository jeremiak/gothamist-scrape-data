<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> This past weekend saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524004354/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/more_photos_of_ad-rocks_mca_day_app.php#photo-1">a nice tribute</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524004354/http://gothamist.com/tags/adamyauch">Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch</a> in Union Square Park, but now some locals want to permanently honor the late Beastie Boy with a park of his own. Residents are rallying to rename <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524004354/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B223F/highlights">Squibb Park</a> in Brooklyn Heights after Yauch, who grew up in the neighborhood. On the Facebook page they started, the people behind the push wrote:<br>
</p><blockquote>Squibb Park is currently undergoing a transformation into a skateboarding facility and gateway to Brooklyn Bridge Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524004354/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/40620">The Brooklyn Heights Blog community</a> believes that it would be a fitting tribute to name it after Brooklyn Heights native, musician, humanitarian Adam Yauch (MCA) of the Beastie Boys. Adam Yauch Park sits directly across the street from the Harry Chapin Playground which is also named after a great Brooklyn Heights resident, musician and humanitarian.</blockquote><br>
Right now you can show your support by spreading the word and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524004354/https://www.facebook.com/AdamYauchPark">&quot;liking&quot; the Facebook page</a>. And no disrespect to pharmaceutical pioneer Dr. Edward Robinson Squibb, who the park is currently named for... but he hailed from Delaware and probably never skateboarded a day in his life.<p></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to Bikini Kill&apos;s Kathleen Hanna, Ad-Rock (her husband) &quot;has already begun working with the Parks Commissioner to fix up and rename State Street Park where Yauch actually played as a kid to &apos;Adam Yauch Park&apos;. It would be great to get people behind THIS idea as it won&apos;t hurt the Squibb family and it would be awesome to fix up the bball court there as a tribute.&quot;</p>
