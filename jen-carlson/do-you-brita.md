										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="brita0410.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430110305im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/brita0410.jpg" width="85" height="102" class="image-right"> </span>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430110305/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/65376/">NYMag</a> had a lab analyze samples of tap water from 14 locations around the city. While the water checked out (and has passed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430110305/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/10/tap_water_taste_test_at_amnh.php">taste tests</a> in the past), they made a list of some extra goodies that were found in it, including sodium, nitrates, trihalomethanes, iron and manganese, arsenic (!) and calcium carbonate. While the Riverkeeper folks say we can drink our city&apos;s tap water with confidence, that whole arsenic thing may have some considering the world of water filtration (the site confirms that &quot;severe weather, the odd rusting pipe, and other conditions&quot; may further contaminate the system). So, do you take your chances, or do you filter your tap?</p>
