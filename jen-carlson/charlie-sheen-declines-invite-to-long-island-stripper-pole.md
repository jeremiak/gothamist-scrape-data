<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sheencapri0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sheencapri0311.jpg" width="640" height="261" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>One of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239/http://gothamist.com/tags/charliesheen">Charlie Sheen</a>&apos;s temporary goddesses, 22-year-old Capri Anderson (who you may remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/27/sheen_was_found_naked_frothing_in_e.php">from the Eloise Suite</a> at the Plaza), has invited Charlie Sheen to serve her with the legal papers she&apos;s expecting whilst she works the pole on Long Island next month. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/03/16/2011-03-16_charlie_sheen_rejects_porn_star_capri_andersons_invitation_to_serve_her_with_law.html">the Daily News</a>, she&apos;ll be at The Scene on April 15th and 16th, and has invited to actor to serve the papers to here there; his attorney says, &quot;She wants to make it a PR event where she&apos;s served at a strip club? Well we&apos;re not going to accommodate her career. For her to say serve me while I&apos;m stripping, it shows who we&apos;re dealing with.&quot;</p>

<p>Anderson claimed that Sheen snorted some white stuff at the Plaza last year before choking her and threatening to kill her. Sheen sued her for theft and extortion (she allegedly stole a watch and demanded $1 million after the incident), saying she &quot;fabricated a sensational tale about being assaulted, battered and held against her will, and used that fictional story as a basis for an extortion plot.&quot; According to Team Sheen, Anderson&apos;s gone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239/http://celebs.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474979142036">into hiding</a> and has refused to accept service of the lawsuit for months. In the end, they claim Charlie just wants his watch back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sheen is preparing to take his one man show on the road, and will be hitting the stage of Radio City Music Hall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/get_ready_nyc_charlie_sheen_brings.php">next month</a>. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239/http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/17/charlie-sheen-new-york-radio-city-music-hall-sold-out/">TMZ</a> is reporting the shows have sold out, we just checked at 2 p.m. and there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042239/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1D00466FFC3A65BE?artistid=1568566&amp;majorcatid=10002&amp;minorcatid=51">still seats available</a> (#losing?).</p>
