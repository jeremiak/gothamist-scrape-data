<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307013943/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/01/25/2010-01-25_subway_courts_a_bad_ride_only_1_in_5_straphangers_charged_with_breaking_transit_.html">The Daily News</a> takes a look at your chances of beating that ticket you got underground, reporting that in 2006, a whopping &quot;9,577 summonses were upheld after hearings while 2,183 were dismissed,&quot; though an additional 3,778 summonses were dismissed prior to hearings. The NYCLU, who just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307013943/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/29/judge_transit_authority_must_open_s.php">gained access</a> to the previously private trials, says the conviction rate is too high, and &quot;thousands of people who have no lawyer are facing hearings where judges essentially act as prosecutors.&quot;</p>

<p>Kind of ridiculous: one woman was on a mini-trial for getting ticketed after her son ran ahead of her through the turnstile when she swiped her MetroCard. She ended up using his student card to get through, which landed her a $100 fine. She lost her case.</p>
