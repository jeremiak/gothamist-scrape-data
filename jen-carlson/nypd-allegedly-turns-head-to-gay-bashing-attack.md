<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phphmOCXBPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083800im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phphmOCXBPM.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="image-left"> </span>This past Friday night, WPLJ DJ Blake Hayes, cabaret and Broadway performer Danny Calvert and another friend were walking down 9th Avenue in Hell&apos;s Kitchen when a cigarette butt was thrown at them by a man outside of McCoy&apos;s bar, followed by the words, &quot;Keep moving, faggot.&quot; </p>

<p>Hayes reports back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083800/http://blakehayes.com/blog.php?id=20">on his website</a> that they &quot;exchanged words, more and more heated, until he started to approach us, threatening violence.  Before we knew it, he had thrown one friend against a car, denting it.  The other took two punches to the face, cutting his lip before the bouncer at McCoy&apos;s came out and stopped him.&quot;</p>

<p>The police were called and five officers arrived; after recounting the incident to them they were told the NYPD <em>wouldn&apos;t</em> be taking down their attacker&apos;s information, nor would they be able to press charges. As for the dented car, the officers told them, &quot;<strong>They&apos;re NJ plates, we can&apos;t do anything.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The man was let back into the bar by the very bouncer who witnessed the incident and stopped the attack from escalating any further. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083800/http://blakehayes.com/blog.php?id=21">Hayes now asks</a> that people call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120083800/http://www.yelp.com/biz/mccoys-bar-new-york">McCoy&apos;s</a> to challenge that action, and call &quot;the police precinct that refused to take an open complaint&#x2014;a legal right.&quot; We&apos;ve contacted the NYPD and will update with their comment should we get one.</p>
