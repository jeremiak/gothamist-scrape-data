<p>Living art project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309034329/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> has announced Francofest, which is exactly what it sounds like it is: a celebration of Franco&apos;s films, curated by Franco himself. Sundance, TriBeCa... these film festivals are nice, but they also feature a distracting number of other actors and directors, not allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the Essence Of Franco. Francofest is for the Franco Purist. This is Full Francophilia. This is sitting in a heated meditation tent, for eight days straight, entering a sweaty hallucinatory state as you become one with the Idea Of Franco. This is a journey into the monstrously genius mind of Francostein, from which you may never return, but why would you want to? </p>

<p>In keeping with the film fest feel, these aren&apos;t your <em>Pineapple Express</em>es or your <em>Eat Pray Love</em>s... these are the films that didn&apos;t have wide releases. The whole thing will happen from March 5th through March 13th at the IFC Center <em>and do you think that Franco wrote up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309034329/http://www.ifccenter.com/series/francofest/">this description</a> himself? </em></p>

<blockquote>&quot;An astonishingly prolific polymath, James Franco has already produced an impressive body of work as an actor, writer, producer and director &#x2028;that would make an artist twice his age jealous. His choices have never feared complexity or controversy, and each new project bristles with the thrill of discovery.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Movies include <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, <em>The Ape</em>, and <em>Howl</em>, amongst others&#x2014;Franco will also be making appearances at some of these.</p>
