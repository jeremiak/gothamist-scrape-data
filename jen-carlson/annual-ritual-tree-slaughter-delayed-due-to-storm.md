<p>While the big tree lighting extravaganza will likely still take place on November 28th as scheduled, the arrival of the tree itself has been delayed due to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164606/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/video_watch_mayor_bloombergs_latest.php">upcoming storm</a>. Each year in early November, New Yorkers raucously celebrate as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164606/http://gothamist.com/tags/deadtree">a tall, tourist tree&apos;s carcass</a> gets dragged through the city streets, where it is eventually greeted by Al Roker at its final resting spot: Rockefeller Center. But this year we&apos;ll have to wait a little bit longer until we see the corpse make its journey and get propped up, <em>Weekend At Bernie&apos;s</em> style. The big day was <em>supposed</em> to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164606/https://twitter.com/rockcenternyc/status/265868682893332482">November 9th</a>, but Rock Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164606/https://twitter.com/rockcenternyc/status/265934012340662272">just Tweeted</a>: &quot;JUST IN: Due to the current weather forecast, the tree will arrive later than expected. As always, we will keep you posted. Thank You.&quot;</p>
