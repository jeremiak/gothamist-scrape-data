Today they report that while no plaque marks the crash spot at 7th Avenue and Sterling Place (which may be why many locals have no idea it even happened), there <em>are</em> physical markers in the area.</p>

<blockquote>You could even, if you had X-ray vision, see the shattered pieces of the jet itself, hiding behind a backyard bush just feet from where they fell a half-century ago... the unofficial memorials tell their own story.</blockquote>

<p>One local they talk to says a landlord warned him that he may find fingers while digging in the garden in the back of his apartment! Another, Steve Keltner, has &quot;two big pieces of what was clearly once a plane&quot; in his backyard. The pieces were found by teens who were digging through a condo development site five years ago, they sold them to Keltner for 5 bucks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009223708/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/16/flashback.php">Here&apos;s a look back</a> at the crash site just after it occurred&#x2014;it was well documented by LIFE magazine at the time.</p>
