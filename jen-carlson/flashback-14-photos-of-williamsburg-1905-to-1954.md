</div></div>					<p>These photos were all taken in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in the early and mid-1900s. The photos from 1954 are all by Alfred Eisenstaedt for LIFE magazine, and were for a story called &quot;Murder For Thrills&quot; which was <em>likely</em> about the the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064329/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Thrill_Killers">Brooklyn Thrill Killers</a>, who &quot;were a gang of Jewish neo-Nazi teenage boys who, in the summer of 1954, killed two men (one by drowning, the other by beating) and tortured several others in Brooklyn.&quot; </p>

<p>The other photographs are courtesy of the New York Public Library, and show various parts of Williamsburg from 1901 through 1937 (right around the time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064329/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/04/flashback_mccarren_park_pool.php">McCarren Park Pool</a> opened, as a pool!).</p>
