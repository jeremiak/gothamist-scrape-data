<p>Graphic designer Milton Glaser, the man behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170318/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/original_sketch_for_i_3_ny.php">the I &#x2665; NY logo</a> and so much more, has been brought into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170318/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> fold by Matthew Weiner for the final season. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170318/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/arts/design/mad-men-enlists-the-graphics-guru-milton-glaser.html">The NY Times</a>, who documented a client meeting between the two, revealed that Weiner has long dreamed of bringing Glaser on board to create the show&apos;s ads, which is fitting since he &quot;forged the sophisticated, exuberant advertising look of the late 1960s,&quot; the era the show has been set in. When we last left Draper &amp; Co. it was November 1968, and while it&apos;s unclear if we&apos;ll still be in that exact year when the show returns in April, it will still be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170318/http://gothamist.com/tags/1960s">the &apos;60s</a>.</p>

<p>Glaser, who still runs a small firm out of his New York townhouse, told Weiner, &#x201C;I could have walked in the door of that firm [Sterling Cooper &amp; Partners] I knew those people.&#x201D; For the artwork, Glaser created something new, but with a nod to his past designs&#x2014;the Times notes, &quot;What first reads as abstraction resolves into a profile of a woman&#x2019;s face, the spire of the Chrysler Building and a glass into which wine is being poured.&quot; Wait, do you see the Chrysler Building in here? Maybe after some LSD?</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="LGmadmenposter.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170318im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/LGmadmenposter.jpg" width="640" height="932" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>As for CLUES, Weiner did tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170318/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/arts/design/mad-men-enlists-the-graphics-guru-milton-glaser.html">the Times</a>: &#x201C;There is a dreamlike quality to it, and believe it or not, it is related to the show, and not because it&#x2019;s psychedelic. That&#x2019;s not what it&#x2019;s about. What it&#x2019;s about is the material and the immaterial world, and that&#x2019;s what I loved. It maintains the idea that this is somehow going on in Don Draper&#x2019;s mind, which is what the story is always about&#x2014;and what the back of his head is about, on some level.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Yesterday AMC released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170318/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/06/what_is_this_mad_men_teaser_trying.php">the first teaser trailer</a>, which shows Don walking down the stairs of a plane. A master of the vague, that Weiner.</p>
