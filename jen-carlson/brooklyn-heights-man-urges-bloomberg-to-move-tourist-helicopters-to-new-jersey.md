<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cloudman1212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102722im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cloudman1212.jpeg" width="320" height="240" class="image-right"> </span>At today&apos;s press conference in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102722/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/photos_pier_5_opens_in_brooklyn_bri.php">Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s gorgeous new Pier 5</a>, Mayor Bloomberg opened up the floor to off-topic questions. Since the Brooklyn Heights locals seemed to outnumber the press at the grand opening of the pier, one of the first came from a local man who seems to do a lot of fist-shaking at the sky.</p>

<p>Seizing the opportunity to pose a direct question to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102722/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/bloomberg_caught_repeatedly_violati.php">our helicopter-loving mayor</a>, the unidentified resident brought up a perpetually touchy subject among Brooklyn Heights residents: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102722/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/brooklynites_enough_is_enough_ban_t.php">the helicopter noise</a>. Bloomberg acknowledged that tourist helicopters do take off from lower Manhattan and do sometimes fly over, or near, the Brooklyn Heights area&#x2014;in fact, two flew over while the press conference was going on. </p>

<p>Playing along, Bloomberg asked the man what solution he would propose, to which the helicopter-hater replied: &quot;Why can&apos;t you move them somewhere else?&quot; You know, somewhere where <em>he</em> doesn&apos;t live. Not skipping a beat, the Mayor asked what neighborhoods they <em>should</em> fly over. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; the man replied, &quot;New Jersey.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg noted that NYC tourists do not want to go to <em>or</em> see New Jersey, and the man consoled himself with some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102722/https://twitter.com/BklynBrdgPark/status/279290715907973121">complimentary gourmet Jaques Torres hot chocolate</a> before presumably storming back to his multi-million dollar converted soundproof carriage house.</p>
