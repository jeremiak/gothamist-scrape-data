<p>If you missed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073356/http://awkwafina.com/">Awkwafina</a> when she released &quot;My Vag&quot;&#x2014;arguably the most perfect song ever penned about the vagina&#x2014;then first, you&apos;ll want to check that out now: </p>

<p>The 24-year-old rapper hails from Queens and attended the famous La Guardia High School where she played trumpet, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073356/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/14/meet-awkwafina-an-asian-female-rapper-on-vaginas-tackling-racism-more.html">Daily Beast</a>, who basically describe her as a bad-ass Asian Daria in their profile.</p>

<p>The up-and-coming rap sensation just released a new video today for &quot;NYC B*tche$,&quot; which will likely be on the mixtape she&apos;s looking to release later this month. Listen to her trash Jay-Z&apos;s stadium, bros, douchebags, vegans, hipsters, shitty artists, bitches from Bushwick (&quot;they all live in Bushwick, they all love Bushwick, but I say fuck that shit&quot;), and transplants (&quot;NYC bitch, that&apos;s where I come from, not where I moved to on mom and dad&apos;s trust fund... you out of state fakes get your iPad stolen&quot;):</p>
