<p>Just as he did the first time around, J.J. Abrams dropped this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630054925/http://gothamist.com/tags/cloverfield"><em>Cloverfield</em></a> trailer out of thin air. There had been no news of a sequel to his 2008 monster movie, but last night a trailer screened during previews of Michael Bay&#x2019;s <em>13 Hours</em>. This one&apos;s called <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> and stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher, Jr. (who didn&apos;t even hint at this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630054925/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/live_from_gothamist_house_johnny_ga.php">when he was in our office this week</a>). </p>

<p>The trailer shows the three stars in an underground bunker as &quot;I Think We&apos;re Alone Now&quot; plays on a jukebox, soundtracking the impending doom. Rumblings of trouble coming from outside kick off the chaos, though it&apos;s unclear where outside <em>is</em> (the first flick took place in NYC). As he did the first time around&#x2014;and as any expert monster movie maker does&#x2014;Abrams is keeping the monster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630054925/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/14/cloverfield_mon.php">mysterious</a> for now.</p>

<p>The movie will be out on March 11th.</p>
