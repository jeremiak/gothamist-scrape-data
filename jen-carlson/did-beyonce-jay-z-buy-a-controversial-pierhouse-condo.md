										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="new5condobkbridgehotel.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054307im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/new5condobkbridgehotel.jpg" width="640" height="361" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Beyonc&#xE9; and Jay-Z are surrounded by rumors with every move they make, and we usually ignore them all <em>en masse</em>, but this one is too intriguing&#x2014;the couple may be moving in to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054307/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/28/brooklyn_bridge_park_condos.php">the controversial, view-blocking Pierhouse condos</a> in Brooklyn Bridge Park. </p>

<p>The rumor stems from a Brooklyn Heights community board meeting, where a &quot;long-time local&quot; announced the alleged purchase. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054307/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/3/dtg-beyonce-jay-z-bridge-park-2016-01-15-bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the local &quot;said a park security guard let the colossal news slip while the pair were chatting during an evening stroll.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to a rep for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054307/http://gothamist.com/tags/pierhouse">the building</a>, which will not be fully completed until next year, and will update when we hear back. However, there is no current confirmation about the purchase, and last we heard they were moving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054307/http://laist.com/2015/02/24/jay_and_bey_pay_150kmonth_to_rent_t.php">to LA</a>, like everyone else. On top of that, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054307/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2016/01/11/beyonce_jayz_may_have_picked_up_a_brooklyn_heights_condo.php">Curbed</a> the Best Unit hasn&apos;t been purchased yet&#x2014;&quot;at least 78 of the building&apos;s 106 condos have gone into contract. Not included in that tally is the building&apos;s $10.49 million five-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment, which is the priciest in the development currently listed.&quot; </p>

<p>Hopefully they did buy at Pierhouse though, and can get the illuminati to fix <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054307/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/12/when_is_squibb_bridge_opening.php">the pedestrian bridge</a>.</p>
