title: See What Happens When You Film Contemporary NYC With Old Super 8 Film
---

	
										<p>In the past we wanted our visual documentation to be crystal clear, and futuristic, even&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420073447/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/24/time_travel_to_the_magical_world_of.php">just check out this stunning 1993 footage of NYC shot in HD</a>. Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420073447/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/31/1940s_nyc_cushman_photos.php">these Kodachrome shots</a> making the streets of 1940s New York pop during an era when black &amp; white was still the norm. But today we apply filters to our Instagram photos and upload YouTube videos shot with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420073447/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_8_film">Super 8</a> in order to make our high-def world feel old school.</p>

<p>This footage, for example, was taken last summer, but the film stock makes contemporary NYC look retro&#x2014;&quot;It&apos;s interesting to see how filming NYC in a modern time can look so different simply because of the format used,&quot; the man behind the camera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420073447/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io67yBovf-E">posted on YouTube</a>. <em>But is it, Willem?</em> Below, see a city filmed with modern day technology in such a way that it looks like we don&apos;t have modern day technology.  </p>
