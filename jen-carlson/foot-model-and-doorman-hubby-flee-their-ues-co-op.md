										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpobGwZRPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230205928im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpobGwZRPM.jpg" width="350" height="172" class="image-left"> </span>Foot model <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230205928/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinaambers">Christina Ambers</a> and her husband Angel Rotger have officially left the building. The duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230205928/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/20/foot_model_who_married_doorman_sues.php">caused quite a stir</a> at their Upper East Side co-op after falling in love in 2007, when Rotger was Ambers&apos; doorman there. At first it was reported they were receiving harsh treatment from uppity neighbors who didn&apos;t support socializing with the help &#x2014; Rotger was actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230205928/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/21/doorman_who_wedded_foot_model_alleg.php">fired</a> when the relationship continued &#x2014; but later some unsavory stories came out about the couple.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230205928/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/foot_brawl_duo_t9MQjW8bLYgdWmpmAfAvFI">the NY Post</a> reports that they&apos;ve been kicked to the curb and have cleared out of their 340 East 74th Street home.  Ambers filed a $10 million lawsuit against the building for allegedly ostracizing her, and at a hearing yesterday the co-op board came forward with proof that it was the former residents who were bullying them.</p>

<p>The board&apos;s lawyer says tenants were afraid of the couple and told horror stories of Ambers screaming after midnight, calling neighbors fat and ugly, and Rotgers verbally and physically assaulting the super&apos;s wife. He even threatened the night doorman, saying, &quot;You stupid fat fuck, I&apos;ll break your face. See me outside of the camera range &#x2014; I&apos;ll slam your fucking head.&quot; The incident was, of course, caught on tape. Anyone looking for an apartment on the UES?</p>
