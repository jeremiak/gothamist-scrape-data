<p>Let&apos;s fully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202900/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/27/unpacking_last_nights_mad_men_3.php">revisit</a> that time in late 1968 when Jefferson Airplane took to the roof of the Schuyler Hotel in Manhattan to play a free concert, screaming to the city: &quot;Hello New York! New York, wake up you fuckers! Free music! Nice songs! Free love!&quot;</p>

<p>The band&#x2014;who just released their fourth album and was just featured on the cover of LIFE magazine&#x2014;had their crew set up sound equipment on the roof of the 9-story hotel on West 45th Street in Midtown. The whole thing was filmed by Jean-Luc Godard and D.A. Pennebaker, for the unfinished film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202900/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_A.M._(unfinished_film)"><em>One A.M.</em></a>, or <em>One American Movie</em>. (It later ended up in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202900/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067532/"><em>1 P.M.</em></a>, or <em>One Parallel Movie</em>) The book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202900/http://books.google.com/books?id=TKyYNB0pGIoC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=jefferson+airplane+new+york+schuyler+hotel+&amp;source=web&amp;ots=q7_tunJnrE&amp;sig=g5-6cccXNWk5OzyHMGECXFcB2EI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=jefferson%20airplane%20new%20york%20schuyler%20hotel&amp;f=false"><em>Got A Revolution!</em></a> recalled the day: &quot;On the rooftop, crew, friends, and the curious gathered to listen, and dance. On the street below, New Yorkers&#x2014;usually fazed by nothing&#x2014;stopped in their tracks to gaze skyward. At the song&apos;s conclusion, the band ran over to the edge of the roof, climbing the chain-link fence to peer down at those peering up at them.&quot;</p>

<p>But, being without permits, they didn&apos;t last long up there before the NYPD showed up and shut things down. In the below footage you can hear one officer telling them, &quot;I don&apos;t mind, it sounds nice, believe me, it&apos;s a good change. But the city can&apos;t stand it.&quot; Later, another demands: &quot;Let everybody go. Make sure they stop the music. If they don&apos;t, lock them up.&quot;</p>

<p>Actor Rip Torn, a friend of the band who was also involved in the film project, was taken away in a police car. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201202900/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VgMdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NZsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=jefferson%20airplane&amp;pg=4112%2C4092612">The AP</a> reported on it the following day, with the headline: <em>The &apos;Plane&apos; Bombs Out</em>, noting that &quot;During a police investigation, [actor Rip] Torn got into an argument and pushed a patrolman, officers said. He was issued a summons for harassment. The film company, Leacock Pennebaker Inc., also received a summons for creating a public disturbance and filming without a permit.&quot;</p>
