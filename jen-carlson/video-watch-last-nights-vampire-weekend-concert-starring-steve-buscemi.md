<p>Last night Vampire Weekend played a rather intimate show at Roseland Ballroom, and if you weren&apos;t invited you can now watch it all on your computer screen just like how you now experience most of life anyway. </p>

<p>The concert continued the storyline between the band and Steve Buscemi, and odd romance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153233/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/steve_buscemi_and_vampire_weekend_m.php">that began at the Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>. Turns out it was all just a marketing ploy by Amex, but an endearing one as far as marketing ploys go. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153233/http://stereogum.com/1335292/watch-vampire-weekends-steve-buscemi-directed-unstaged-concert-roseland-ballroom-42913/concert/">Stereogum</a>&apos;s Amrit Singh notes that at last night&apos;s show there was &quot;a heavy dose of lifechampion Steve Buscemi,&quot; who was directing the live concert video that was streaming, and also made an appearance on stage to sing &quot;A-Punk.&quot; Click play, and you&apos;ll also get to enjoy some dinner scenes with the band, Buscemi and Blondie:</p>

<p>Vampire Weekend will headline Barclays Center on September 20th, and next month they&apos;ll release a new album <em>and</em> they&apos;ll be the musical guest when Kristin Wiig hosts <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on May 11th.</p>
