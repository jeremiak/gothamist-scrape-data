<p>In 1912 Miss Elsie Scheel of Brooklyn was deemed the &#x201C;most nearly perfect specimen of womanhood&#x201D; out of 400 other coeds at Cornell that year. The 24-year-old Scheel had come to Cornell from Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights&#x2014;she enjoyed horticulture, outdoor sports, and was an ardent suffragette. One paper declared that she was &quot;taller than Venus de Milo,&quot; standing five feet seven inches tall, weighing in &quot;at a healthy 171 pounds, and possessing a decidedly pear-shaped figure (it measured 35-30-40).&quot; <em>Isn&apos;t that refreshing?</em> According to the NY Times report, Scheel did not have &quot;a single defect.&quot;</p>

<p>On her eating habits, the paper reported that she did not like candy or delicacies, but preferred beefsteak [note: as a woman, she wouldn&apos;t be able to attend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071723/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/11/the_beefsteak_dinner_craze_of_the_1.php">the famous beefsteak dinners</a> until the 1920s]. She rarely ate breakfast, and never drank tea or coffee. And here&apos;s an interesting fact they dropped in: &quot;<strong>She has never been ill and doesn&apos;t know what fear is</strong>&quot;&#x2014;in fact, she told women that they would &quot;be happier if they got over the fear of things.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, we cannot track down any photographs of Miss Scheel... but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071723/http://kateharding.net/2010/01/12/just-a-reminder/">one woman</a> brought her to life through society&apos;s more harsh modern day standards: &quot;Miss Elsie Scheel&#x2019;s BMI would have been 26.8, placing her squarely in today&#x2019;s dreaded &apos;overweight&apos; category... [and] at Banana Republic she would wear a size 8 top, a 12/14 bottom, and probably a 12 dress with the bust taken in.&quot; Go ahead and have that extra glass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071723/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/20/holiday_foods.php">of egg nog</a> next week, and toast Miss Scheer and a time when women weren&apos;t held to impossible standards. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Here she is! You can read more about Scheer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071723/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8-1fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AgMGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1468%2C668285">right here</a>, where she says she achieved her perfection by &quot;Sane living... I have eaten only what I wanted and when I wanted it.&quot;: </p>
