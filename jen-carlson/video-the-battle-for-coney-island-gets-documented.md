---

	
										<p>The rise and fall of Coney Island has been documented, and it&apos;s airing on PBS starting this week. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519225105/http://www.LastSummerAtConeyIsland.com/"><em>Last Summer at Coney Island</em></a> essentially brings you to the frontlines of the battle for the birthplace of amusements (and let&apos;s not forget, <em>the hot dog</em>). The doc&apos;s press release lays out the key players, saying:</p>

<p>&quot;After years of false starts, change is coming to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519225105/http://gothamist.com/tags/coneyisland">Coney Island</a>. Come Hell or high water, the city of New York is determined to revitalize the once glorious, world capitol of amusements. Meanwhile, a private developer with dubious motives has been purchasing every square foot of land he can get his hands on. The neighborhood&apos;s residents, along with the amusement community and the millions who cherish Coney Island&apos;s legacy are left wondering what will happen next. Seaside salvation or Brooklyn boondoggle?&quot;</p>

<p>The documentary will focus on the past few years, but will also deliver some nostalgia-inducing clips. Check out the trailer below (then watch the entire thing on WNET/Thirteen&#x2014;May 15th at 10 p.m. and May 16th at 2:30 a.m.). </p>
