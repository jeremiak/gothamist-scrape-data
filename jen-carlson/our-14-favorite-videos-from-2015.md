<p>With 2015 wrapping up, we&apos;re taking a look back at some of our original videos shot throughout the year&#x2014;from Staten Island to an NYPD precinct basement, from The Hole to hidden corners of Grand Central Terminal. Check out some of our favorites, shot by our videographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062102/https://twitter.com/j_leibowitz">Jessica Leibowitz</a>, below.

<p>The subbasement of Grand Central, called M-42, isn&apos;t on any blueprints. Its location and access points are kept a secret, but this year we got to go down there, passing by 600 million year old New York schist and bedrock on our way. While there we learned about how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062102/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/14/grand_central_hilter_nazis.php#photo-1">Hitler tried to infiltrate M-42</a>. </p>

<p>For the past 40 years, legendary musicians and guitar aficionados have been flocking to Mandolin Brothers, the Staten Island mom-and-pop guitar emporium. Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Christopher Guest, Dave Van Ronk, Joni Mitchell, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Steven Seagal and Conan O&apos;Brien are but some of the big name players who made the trip. Sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062102/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/staten_island_mandolin_bros.php">they&apos;re getting ready to close up shop soon</a>.</p>
