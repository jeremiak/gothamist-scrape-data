<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140905132209/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/09/15/herzog_de_meurons_56_leonard_the_instareviews.php">Everyone is talking</a> about the Herzog &amp; de Meuron&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140905132209/http://www.56leonardtribeca.com/">56 Leonard</a> reveal, the apartment complex that looks like it was designed by a Gehry-influenced Dr. Seuss. The building will be a 57-story residential complex in Tribeca, housing 145 residences, each with its own unique floor plan and private outdoor space. The architects describe the units as &#x201C;houses stacked in the sky,&#x201D; but they aren&apos;t for those scared of heights.</p>

<p>Come Fall 2010, residents will start calling the $650 million luxury building home, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140905132209/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/09/15/jenga_herzog_de_meurons_56_leonard_revealed.php">Curbed</a> reports that residences, all 2 to 5-bedrooms, will range from $3.5 million to $33 million.</p>

<p>Even with floor-to-ceiling fireplace hearths, a library, a 75-foot swimming pool, a screening room, a yoga studio and a &quot;Tribeca Tot Room&quot; for the kiddies...would you live in such a vertigo-inducing building?<br>
