Dating back to 1885, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521064410/http://www.nysonglines.com/28st.htm#6av">music publishers came to the area</a>, Tin Pan Alley kept the music going through the 1950s--and in the eyes of many should be preserved.</p><blockquote>Much to the dismay of tenants and preservationists, five of the buildings on West 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue - a block that for 60 years was the heart of the songwriting industry - have gone up for sale.<p></p>

<p>The buildings, at 47, 49, 51, 53 and 55 West 28th Street, are being sold as a group for - hold on to your hat in these cacophonous economic times - a mere $44 million.</p></blockquote>The information was posted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521064410/http://lostnewyorkcity.blogspot.com/2008/10/tin-pan-alley-threatened.html">Lost City</a> yesterday, who pointed towards a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521064410/http://www.loopnet.com/property/15654744/47-49-51-53-55-West-28th-St/">Loopnet</a> listing that recommends the buildings, all well-maintained 4-story brownstones, be demolished in order to open up 111,000-sq-ft of Prime Chelsea property. The listing even comes complete with a soulless rendering of a highrise. Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council, told the paper that &quot;It&apos;s a very, very disturbing prospect. These buildings are incredibly significant to the development of New York City. They helped launch the careers of songwriters and musicians who are still popular today.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In 2003 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521064410/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05EFDE103DF930A25754C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">the NY Times</a> took at look at Tin Pan Alley, talking to a longtime resident of No. 47, Ms. Ekman, whose apartment floors sloped a radical five inches. &quot;She thinks the future of the row is not a real estate question, but an engineering one &apos;&apos;It&apos;s just a question of how long they can stand up&apos;&apos; she says.&quot; Today some of the tenants, who currently pay approximately $1,000 a month for 1,000 sq-ft, have hired a lawyer and plan to ask for $1 million per apartment.</p>
