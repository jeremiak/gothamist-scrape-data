---

<p>As the Department of Health <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204254/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/31/rats_3.php">cuts down</a> on pest patrolers, word is that Brighton Beach has been taken over by rats! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204254/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/13/rat_2.php">Ratdemic <em>is upon us</em></a>. One resident, Lale Can, took some video of the neighborhood&apos;s visitors (seen below), which some believe came from a huge rat&apos;s nest underground. The nest was allegedly disturbed as construction started near the 8th Street Bridge. Another resident told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204254/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7386295">Eyewitness News</a> that the rodents now &quot;walk around like it&apos;s their block.&quot;</p>

<p>The rats are eating through wires in cars, leaving holes in the ground and in garbage cans, and stealthy avoiding rat traps. The DoH released a statement, noting they have done 47 inspections of the area this month alone. Their plan is to work with the Sanitation Department regarding &quot;the root cause of the problem... illegal feeding of wildlife.&quot; A spokesperson said they found pieces of bread in the area.</p>
