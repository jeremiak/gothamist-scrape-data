<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174352/http://gothamist.com/tags/snooki">Snooki</a> is pregnant. Just let that sink in for a moment, and then we, as a people, need to figure out a plan.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old reality star is three month&apos;s along, her 15 minutes have been ticking down for a while, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174352/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/snooki_lied_she_preggers_LMEWWgqwCvDpaVhud3x6wK#ixzz1nmOX4h8Y">the NY Post</a> believes she&apos;s trying to bankroll this baby into becoming &quot;the next Kourtney Kardashian.&quot; (Snooki, she&apos;s like the least favorite Kardashian!) Last summer she said she didn&apos;t want to get married <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174352/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2011/08/11/jersey-shore-snooki-jionni-lavalle-marriage-dad/">until she turned 26</a>, but you know what they say, if you want to make Satan laugh, tell him your plans. We&apos;re picturing a quaint little wedding on the Shore, scripted of course, and possibly stretched out into a very special MTV miniseries. </p>

<p>The father of the unborn child is her boyfriend Jionni LaValle, and the couple have been together for just a little bit over a year, if you don&apos;t count the time off from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174352/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2000530/Jersey-Shore-star-Snooki-split-Jionni-LaValle-8-months-trust-issues.html">their break-ups</a>.</p>

<p>Currently MTV is filming her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174352/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/25/jersey_city_brace_yourself_snooki_j.php">new show</a> with J-Woww, but the network &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t comment on series in production,&quot; so it&apos;s unclear what they&apos;re doing with this news (but at least NJ locals have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174352/http://www.thesuperficial.com/snookis-banned-from-liquor-stores-now-02-2012">banned her from liquor stores</a>). It&apos;s also unclear if this is a going to be a guido or guidette. We would just like to take this time to say that adoption is a valid and very brave decision. </p>
