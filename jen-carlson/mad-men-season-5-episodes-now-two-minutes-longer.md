										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="draperhendricks091121.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150041im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/draperhendricks091121.jpg" width="350" height="252" class="image-right"> </span>During the great <em>Mad Men</em> drama of early 2011 we learned that the show would go on, eventually, but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150041/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/mad_men_5.php">two minutes shaved off</a> in order to save some of the cast, or put more money in Matthew Weiner&apos;s pockets, or whatever. Were you actually upset about losing <em>two minutes</em> of face time with Don Draper &amp; Co.? Well then, good news, those minutes are back.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150041/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/AMC-Restores-Mad-Men-Running-Length-Upcoming-Season-35245.html">Cinemablend</a> reports on the newly saved minutes, saying, &quot;Weiner seemed very pleased to announce the change (or change back, rather) during the Emmy Elite Showrunners breakfast ... &apos;I don&apos;t know how they managed to make that work out ... It was a lot of worry. I&apos;m so thrilled.&apos;&quot; Season 5 will likely air starting in March next year.</p>

<p>Does this mean <em>Breaking Bad</em> will get money from their cut budget back, and <em>The Walking Dead</em> will see the return of showrunner Frank Darabont? No. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150041/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/16/did_mad_men_kill_every_other_amc_sh.php">No it doesn&apos;t</a>. But you get 120 more seconds of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150041/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/25/christina_hendricks_says_her_breast.php">face time</a> with Christina Hendricks.</p>
