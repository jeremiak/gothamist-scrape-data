Now word is that New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is investigating the claims that those of Asian descent are refused iPads due to smuggling fears. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023155331/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0610/Cuomo_looks_into_iPad_sales_over_discrimination_claim.html?showall">Politico</a> the discrimination didn&apos;t end in SoHo, as Cuomo&apos;s office &quot;received complaints over the treatment at <em>two</em> Apple stores in New York City.&quot; The other is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023155331/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/06/a_preview_of_th_1.php">14th Street</a> store, and a source told the site that investigators from the office&apos;s Civil Rights Bureau had already interviewed store managers, and that Apple was cooperating as the investigation continues.</p>
