<p>Creative Brooklynites: it&apos;s time to temporarily retire in Queens! 3rd Ward has built what they&apos;re calling their own version of Boca Raton in Long Island City, dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140154/http://thepalmsnyc.com/">The Palms</a>... but it sounds a little young to us. They say their month long project is &quot;one part open-air dance party, one part ode to the Boca Raton pools of a bygone era.&quot; Sadly, no shuffleboard... but there will be lounge chairs, lobster rolls, music, and the three Ds: drinks, dumpster pools, and a dance floor.</p>

<p>Every weekend from August 12th through Labor Day, The Palms&#x2014;housed in a 15,000 square foot outdoor area&#x2014;will be open for business, along with some of New York City&apos;s best food trucks (Luke&apos;s Lobster and Mexicue, to name a few).</p>

<p>Between this and the Lower East Side&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140154/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/02/new_timeshare_yard_allows_you_to_su.php">Backyard Timeshare</a>, we&apos;re one non-traditional outdoor spot away from a New York Times trend piece on young people enjoying a nice urban oasis, when they&apos;re not canning or whatever.</p>
