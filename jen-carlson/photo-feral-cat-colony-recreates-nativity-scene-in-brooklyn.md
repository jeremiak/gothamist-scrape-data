title: Photo: Feral Cat Colony Recreates Nativity Scene In Brooklyn
---

	
										<p>It looks like a Photoshop made for The Internet to enjoy, but this photograph of a colony of feral cats that have taken over a nativity scene in Red Hook is the real deal. And a gift to us all this holiday season:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cativity1213.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140013im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cativity1213.jpg" width="640" height="426" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140013/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131208/red-hook/cat-nativity-annual-delight-for-neighbors-red-hook">DNAInfo</a>, the nativity scene has been set up every December for over a decade at 344 Van Brunt Street, by sisters Annette and Sue Amendola. And every year &quot;when [they] finally put out the statue of the baby Jesus on Dec. 25, the cats oust him from his manger, taking his place on the hay.&quot; A purr-fect tableau, amirite?</p>
