<p>A yoga studio in Chelsea recently phased out women all-together and has rebranded as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231054107/http://www.lemaleyoga.com/">Le Male Yoga</a>, even offering up all nude classes to its testosterone-fueled clientele. The &quot;Nak&apos;d Flow&quot; sessions are described as &quot;playful, fun and liberating,&quot; on their website, and while their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231054107/http://www.lemaleyoga.com/yogassage.html">Yogassage sessions</a> are described as &quot;sensual,&quot; the classes are not. In fact, they are &quot;not sexual in any sense and are grounded in a modern hatha-vinyasa yoga philosophy,&quot; focusing on pose integrating intention, breath and movement, awareness and alignment, strength and flexibility.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231054107/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121012/chelsea/naked-yoga-studio-promises-release-shy-men-from-their-shellsand-pants#ixzz295zI7ROR">DNAInfo</a>, celeb yoga instructor Joschi Schwarz runs the place, which also offers traditional <em>clothed</em> classes for the prudes. Schwarz says most yoga studios are 90% women, and his goal is &quot;to foster a community where men really can connect with each other&quot;... and yourself. The studio is covered in mirrors, and Schwarz says: &quot;You have to see how your body works&#x2014;believe me, if you&apos;re naked, you see everything.&quot;</p>

<p>Classes cost $19 each, or $145 for a month of unlimited classes. Le Male Yoga is located at 163 West 23rd Street (if you go SEND US PHOTOS).</p>
