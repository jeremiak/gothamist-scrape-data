(Courtesy of ShipFoliage.com)</i></div> There is an increasingly fine line between &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;asshole,&quot; especially when it comes to those of a more entrepreneurial spirit. The Bindle Bros, for example, tied cloth to a stick and got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002417/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/fashion/hobo-chic-from-the-bindle-bros-of-brooklyn.html">a NY Times profile</a> out of it. Is it parody or product? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002417/http://www.bindlebros.com/new-products/">Both</a>. And now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002417/https://twitter.com/kylewaring">this guy from Boston</a> has stepped in to commodify Autumn. <p></p>

<p>The URL perfectly explains what his company does: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002417/http://shipfoliage.com/">shipfoliage.com</a> offers Foliage as a Service (FaaS), and the people behind it promise to &quot;collect, preserve and ship gorgeous fall foliage&quot; right to your doorstep. </p>

<p>Three leaves will cost you $19.99, which comes to $6.66 per leaf. 666, as even the amateur satanist knows, is the &quot;number of the beast.&quot; I am not saying there is a connection between this company, the man who runs it, and the underworld, or with any demon that presides over that underworld, I am just pointing to the facts.</p>

<p>The website also explains that the &quot;Grade A&quot; foliage is sourced from New England, and preserved in a way that &quot;enhances the foliage color contrast and also preserves the leaves for years to come!&quot; This process also sounds like dark magic.</p>

<p>Gothamist reached out to the man behind this venture (who is also in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002417/http://atlanticventures.co/">shipping snow</a> business) and I will update if he responds... unless my own ironically dumb product idea takes off and I suddenly disappear into a golden cloud of easy money.</p>
