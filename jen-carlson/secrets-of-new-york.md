We caught a commercial for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811143840/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycmg/nyctv/html/shows/sony.shtml">Secrets of New York</a> on Channel 25 last night and were intrigued by what the show has to offer. While the host looks like an extra from <em>The Matrix</em>, the subject matter is interesting. Exploring what lies beneath our feet and within our walls (there are probably way more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811143840/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/04/12/cat_stuck_in_we.php">Molly the cats</a> than we even want to think about),  New York&#x2019;s oldest bridge, what secrets are buried in the oldest cemetery, stories behind the skyscrapers and the history of the city&apos;s slammers. Not to mention hidden treasures! Land pirates get ready to do some searching. This one episode summary sort of freaks us out though:

</p><blockquote>Paranormal New York: Enigmatic and Unexplainable Mysteries
Venture into Gotham&#x2019;s scary paranormal history to uncover haunted secrets, eerie phenomena and other thought provoking mysteries unexplained by science. Investigate the legends surrounding some of New York City&#x2019;s most chilling anomalies and oddities.</blockquote>
