<p>Last year as the the McCarren Park Pool parties were coming to an end <em>forever</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326041506/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/29/plans_for_new_mccarren_park_pool_wi.php">not forever</a>), we talked to JellyNYC organizer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326041506/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/01/sarah_hooper_jellynyc.php">Sarah Hooper</a> about where they might revive their series this summer. At the time she told us that they were working closely with the Open Space Alliance, Parks Department and Marty Markowitz&#x2019;s office to find a new space, but no matter what, the show will remain free and they&apos;ll always have a Slip n&apos; Slide. Well, it&apos;s all happening people. </p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326041506/http://www.greenpointnews.com/news/pool-parties-out-east-river-concerts-in-thanks-osa">Greenpoint News</a> reported that all parties involved have teamed up with the State to arrange a deal allowing them to use the East River State Park, located on North 8th and 9th Streets and Kent Avenue (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326041506/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=north+8th+and+kent+brooklyn&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.721502,-73.96112&amp;spn=0.008001,0.017231&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">map</a>). Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326041506/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/a-new-home-for-outdoor-concerts-in-williamsburg/">the NY Times</a> is confirming that the 6,000 capacity outdoor space (similar in size to McCarren Pool) will become a venue for the concerts by this summer, and may even house some classical and opera shows. The office of State Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol confirmed, and the OSA stated, &#x201C;This is the continuation of McCarren Park Pool. It&#x2019;s different, but it has its own exquisite beauty, with the waterfront and the skyline of Manhattan.&#x201D;</p>
