										<p><img alt="satcticket.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145236im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/satcticket.jpg" width="200" height="250" class="right">Though the trailer echoed the sentiment that &quot;Brooklyn is the new Manhattan,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145236/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/sjp_warns_futur.php">SJP herself</a> called the outer boroughs &quot;desirable,&quot; last night the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145236/http://gothamist.com/tags/sexandthecity"><em>Sex and the City</em></a> movie premiere took place smack dab in the middle of town at Radio City Music Hall.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145236/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05272008/entertainment/_112745.htm">The NY Post</a> reported back with bold face names and pull quotes from the Swarovski crystal-adorned pink carpet (yes, it was pink), where Carrie &amp; Co. assured us all that the best part about the night was &quot;being here with the fans.&quot; </p>

<p>The organizers of the event weren&apos;t too concerned about those fans, however; seems they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145236/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2008/05/27/2008-05-27_sex_and_the_city_premiere_turns_ugly.html">overbooked the 6,000 seat theater</a> by about, oh, 2,000 or so...and like that, it went from fabulous to frightful; grown women were heard screaming, crying and rising up against those who had wronged them! If only this kind of passion were ignited for slightly more important things.</p><blockquote>The mostly female crowd surged against police barricades, cursing and stomping at the cruel turn of events.<p></p>

<p>&quot;They gave out all these tickets just to make a big scene. It&apos;s not right. It&apos;s not fair. I&apos;m very disappointed,&quot; said Heather Dispresso, 20, of Long Island, who had waited in line for three hours only to be turned away.</p></blockquote>Well played New Line Cinema. Though none of those PR shots seems to be circulating just yet, stories from the fan frontline are! A tipster wrote into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145236/http://gawker.com/5011252/disaster-at-the-sex-and-the-city-premiere">Gawker</a> saying that women were &quot;in near tears waving their tickets and yelling into their cells.&quot; The fan tickets were mostly promotional, but even the $1,000 ticket holders and their Christian Louboutin heels were left slumming it on the sidewalk. <em>Surely</em> this was all made up for when Chris Noth (aka Mr. Big) blew them all a kiss as he breezed in. Or at least by this morning&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145236/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05282008/entertainment/movies/shooting_blahniks_112799.htm?page=0">bad reviews</a>. <p></p>
