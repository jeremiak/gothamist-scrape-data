title: PSA: Do Not Put Your Governors Ball Wristband On Yet, Not Even To Instagram!
---

	
										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130638/http://gothamist.com/tags/governorsball">Governors Ball</a> is taking place the weekend of June 3rd, which is nearly one month from now. Those eager to Instagram their upcoming experience on Randall&apos;s Island, however, have already strapped on their wristbands. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130638/https://twitter.com/search?q=%40govballnyc%20wristband&amp;src=typd">Don&apos;t do this</a>. </p>

<p>I would like to point out that festivals and various music gatherings that occurred prior to the age of social media were just as fun as they are today, without the social sideshow of Instagram/Snapchat/Twitter/Facebook. Maybe even more fun? From the Moondog Coronation Ball to Woodstock to Lollapalooza in the &apos;90s, musical events have long gone undocumented by many attendees, but the attendees were still there and experienced it all. Something to think about! But also think about how you should not put on a wristband for a festival that is not happening for another month.</p>

<p>While the Governors Ball organizers have kindly set up a way for these overzealous attendees to get new wristbands, so that they may free themselves for the next few weeks, not everyone is happy with their fix of a $20 replacement. </p>
