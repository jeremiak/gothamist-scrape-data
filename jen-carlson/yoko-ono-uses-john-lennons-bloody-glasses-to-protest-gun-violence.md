<p>Yesterday was the 44th wedding anniversary of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151543/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono, and along with expressions of personal grief (&quot;The death of a loved one is a hollowing experience. After 33 years our son Sean and I still miss him&quot;), the widower sent a strong, intense statement about gun control through Twitter.</p>

<p>Ono noted that &quot;31,537 people are killed by guns in the U.S.A. every year,&quot; adding, &quot;We are turning this beautiful country into a war zone.&quot; She then Tweeted the above image, which contains the text: &quot;Over 1,057,000 people have been killed by guns in the U.S.A. since John Lennon was shot and killed on December 8, 1980.&quot;</p>

<p>This December will mark 33 years since Lennon&apos;s murder, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151543/http://gothamist.com/tags/markdavidchapman">Mark David Chapman</a> is still serving his &quot;20 years to life&quot; sentence for. At his latest parole hearing, the murderer noted he got the bullets from &quot;an old friend who was a police officer... I told him I needed the bullets... I didn&apos;t tell him what I was going to do. [I chose hollow point bullets] because they were more deadly.&quot;</p>
