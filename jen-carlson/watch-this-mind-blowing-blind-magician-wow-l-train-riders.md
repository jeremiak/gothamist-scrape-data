<p>Recently we saw a guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093312/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/11/this_wizard_can_save_nyc.php">floating a quarter in thin air</a>, and it made us believe in magic. Or at least it made us believe that magicians are out there, working on their craft, and helping our subway commute become a little less mundane, and a little more otherworldly. It&apos;s a great public service, really.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093312/http://www.justinsightmagic.com/">Justin Sight</a>, a magician who suffers vision loss from Stargardt macular degeneration disorder. He&apos;s been working his magic for 15 years, since he was 10 years old, and can often be found making things more interesting underground with his intimate illusions. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve been performing in NYC for a little over 2 years,&quot; he told us, &quot;I frequent the Bedford stop L train platform in Williamsburg right as you enter from Bedford and North 7th.&quot; You are most likely to find him there after 11 p.m., and sometimes earlier in the day. We met up with him a few weeks ago to capture his sleights of hand, and his mad pick-up skills, on film. We still can&apos;t figure out how he did any of this...</p>
