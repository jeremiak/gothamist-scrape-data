<p>Tonight, after a 42 year absence, <em>The Tonight Show</em> will return to New York City with new host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041617/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmyfallon">Jimmy Fallon</a>. The last time it was here was 1972, when Johnny Carson was still behind the desk&#x2014;when he relocated with the show to Los Angeles &quot;it was like losing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041617/http://gothamist.com/tags/EbbetsField">Ebbets Field</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041617/http://gothamist.com/tags/PoloGrounds">Polo Grounds</a>&quot;:</p>

<p>Carson&apos;s Tonight Show lasted from 1962 through 1992, and as this terrific <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041617/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/johnny-carson-the-tonight-show">Vanity Fair</a> feature recalls, his opening monologue would often make fun of our &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041617/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/the_1970s_pamphlet_aimed_at_keeping.php#photo-1">Fun City</a>&quot;:</p><blockquote>&quot;[He] made fun of the downside&#x2014;the muggings, the garbage strike, the blackouts. [Dick] Cavett recalls writing a number of jokes for Carson on urban decay... He joked about the city&#x2019;s high crime rate: &apos;New York is an exciting town where something is happening all the time&#x2014;most, unsolved.&apos; Not even New York&#x2019;s weather was immune to ridicule&#x2014;&apos;It&#x2019;s so cold here in New York that the flashers are just describing themselves.&apos; Unfortunately, Carson&#x2019;s nightly poking fun at New York helped define the city for the American heartland. Even Mayor Lindsay got in on the act on one show, describing a computer-dating machine set up in Central Park where a bachelor deposits his quarter and tells the machine, &apos;I&#x2019;m sensitive, I&#x2019;m single, I&#x2019;m rich,&apos; whereupon the machine mugs him. The jokes got so relentless that the builder Lew Rudin and the president of the New York City Council complained to NBC executives about the bad press Carson was giving New York.&quot;</blockquote>While there don&apos;t seem to be any clips of Mayor Lindsay&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041617/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/26/arts/television/26cars.html">numerous appearances</a> online, here&apos;s a clip from 1969... light up your smokes and fill up your glass: <p></p>

<p>On the show&apos;s return to NYC, Fallon has said, &quot;This is where it should be. It&apos;s electric here. It&apos;s the trendsetting city. It&#x2019;s the most alive city in the world.&quot; He added <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041617/http://instagram.com/p/khdQ23PZ8p/">over Instagram</a> today: &quot;This is it. We are starting a new chapter of the Tonight Show. I can&apos;t even begin to describe what we are all feeling right now here at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, NYC. But I know that we&apos;ll never have this exact feeling ever again. By this time tomorrow we&apos;ll no longer wonder what it would be like to do the Tonight Show. We can&apos;t put that feeling, that moment back in the bottle. All we can do is try to make the best show that we can and make people happy. And we will. Here&apos;s to the first of many. Fun.&quot; And of course: jobs...</p>
