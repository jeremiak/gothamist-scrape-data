<p>Two years ago, almost to the day, we started asking New York bands to keep tour diaries for us - a column we now call Tourist. With SXSW coming up next week, we wanted to invite New York bands heading down to Austin to keep a journal of the experience for us. If you&apos;re in a band from these parts, and would be interested, contact jencarlson (a) gothamist dot com</p>
