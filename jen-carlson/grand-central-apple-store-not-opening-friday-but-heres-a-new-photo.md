<p>While rumors were swirling that the Grand Central Apple Store may be opening on Black Friday, it looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144442/http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/11/22/grand_central_apple_store_wont_open_by_black_friday_construction_worker_says.html">we&apos;ll be waiting</a> a couple more weeks, with the new rumored opening date now <em>Friday, December 9th</em> (though this morning an Apple rep told us, &quot;no opening date has been announced&quot;). The Apple folks <em>did</em> send over this photo of the new display this morning, however, announcing the shop to be &quot;arriving soon.&quot; And a December arrival is still pretty quick, considering we only started hearing about it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144442/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/24/apple_store_in_grand_central_will_b.php">this summer</a>. Chances are they didn&apos;t want to pay that high rent (around $1.1 million/year) and keep doors closed for too long.</p>

<p>When it does open, it will officially be Grand Central&apos;s largest retail space, and the biggest Apple store in the world, at 23,000-feet. Though it won&apos;t have a glass cube, you can check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144442/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/16/renderings_apples_grand_central_sto.php">the renderings here</a>.</p>
