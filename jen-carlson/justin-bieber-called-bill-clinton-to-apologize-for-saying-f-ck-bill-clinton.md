<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115729/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/video_what_nyc_restaurants_mop_buck.php">a video circulated</a> showing Justin Bieber urinating in a New York City restaurant&apos;s mop bucket, like the entitled adult-child pop star that he is. (Turns out this all went down inside Artichoke Basille&apos;s Pizza.) He followed up his bodily fluid performance with an encore: a giant &quot;f*ck you&quot; to former President Bill Clinton, whose photo was hanging on the wall of the establishment. While Bieber didn&apos;t apologize to the restaurant staff who had to clean up his mess, he did take a moment to apologize to the bold face name. </p>

<p>He announced on his Twitter account that he chatted with the former President, Tweeting at him: &quot;thanks for taking the time to talk Mr. President. Your words meant alot. #greatguy.&quot; Clinton Hashtag Great Guy didn&apos;t respond to the Tweet, but a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115729/http://www.extratv.com/2013/07/10/justin-bieber-apology-bill-clinton-phone-call/">told Extra</a> the two had a &quot;great conversation&quot; and Clinton &quot;told the pop star to be conscious of the friends he keeps and to focus on the good work he is doing.&quot; And an &quot;insider&quot; told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115729/http://www.eonline.com/news/438077/justin-bieber-talks-to-bill-clinton-apologizes-for-dissing-ex-president-while-peeing-in-a-bucket">E! Online</a> that the former Prez told the pop star: &quot;If that is the worst thing you have ever done, all is well.&quot;</p>

<p>Bieber also upset people recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107115729/http://chicagoist.com/2013/07/10/internet_incensed_at_photo_of_justi.php">by touching the Stanley Cup</a>, or something.</p>
