										<em>Welcome to our green thumb series where we&apos;ll aim to tell you, or rather, have experts tell you, how to grow the perfect urban garden. Today we&apos;re focusing on the private outdoor garden. Coming up we&apos;ll also have tips on how to grow great fire escape gardens, and what you can grow indoors.</em>

We sent along this photo of our own garden&#x2014;which is half full sun, and half shaded&#x2014;to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, as well as Daniel Bowman Simon of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/http://www.snapgardens.org/">Snap Gardens</a>. Here&apos;s what Simon (who also got the White House <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/http://www.thewhofarm.org/about/">to grow a garden</a>) told us:

<ul><li>Nice to see you&apos;re growing basil and tomatoes in close proximity. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/complant.html"><strong>Companion planting</strong></a> is always good, makes the plants grow better, and reduces predatory pests. 
</li><li>Since you&apos;re growing directly in the ground, though, I&apos;d <strong>have your soil tested</strong>. You can get it done very inexpensively through Environmental Sciences Analytical Center (ESAC) right <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/pub/departments/esac/1535.htm">at Brooklyn College</a>. If your soil is contaminated, they can help you remediate, or you can
garden in planters or raised beds.
</li><li>I don&apos;t know <strong>where you got your plants</strong>, but if you&apos;re not starting your plants from seed, the best places to find plants are at the farmers markets.  One of my favorite vendors is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/http://www.silverheightsfarm.com/">Silver Heights Farm</a>, they have so many heirloom varieties that are well suited to our particular climate, and they, like most farmers market vendors, are always happy to give garden advice.
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/http://www.gardenersnet.com/shade/index.htm"><strong>Shade vegetables</strong></a> are mostly your leafy greens, and any of your fruiting plants and tropicals (peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, squashes, etc) generally need <strong>full sun</strong>.</li></ul>

Uli Lorimer,  the curator of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/http://WWW.BBG.ORG/">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a>&apos;s Native Flora Garden, also tackled our garden, noting: 

<ul><li>These plants will draw wildlife to your backyard, beginning with bees and butterflies and eventually birds as well. Be sure to water all of these plants well during the first year so that good roots can be established. The stalks can be left over the winter for structure and ornament.
</li><li>Don&#x2019;t be afraid to plant closely and thickly as this will give a more immediate effect, and provides competition for weeds. <strong>One other thing that is glaringly missing from the photo is mulch</strong> of some kind. Bare ground will just beget more weeds and mulch helps retain water better, leading to less use of water.
</li><li>If your plants are beginning to look stringy and stretched out, then they are not getting enough light.</li></ul>
 
Lorimer also provided his top 5 picks for shady and full sun native perennials for urban backyards, which you can dig in to below.

<u><strong>WHAT TO GROW IN THE SHADE</strong></u>
<ul><li>Ferns! They prefer cooler moist areas, not too dry like the Ostrich Fern (Mattetuccia struthipoteris) in the background of the picture.  They provide texture , good form and will soften into pleasant autumn tones before going dormant for the winter. Other good ferns to consider are Hay-Scented Fern (Dennstaedtia punctiloba), Cinnamon Fern (Osmunda cinamomea), and Christmas Fern (Polystichum acrosticoides).
</li><li>Wreath Goldenrod (Solidago caesia). Attractive bluish stems, tolerates dry and shade and blooms yellow along the axils of the leaves.
</li><li>White Snakeroot (Ageratina altissima) This is nearly indestructible. Tolerates shade and sun, moist or dry, and will seed itself around when established. Blooms white in late summer, into august.
</li><li>Woodland Sunflower (Helianthus divaricatus) One of the few sunflowers that tolerates some shade. Usually found along the edge of forests this will flower brightly with at least half a day of sun. The leaves fade to a warm golden yellow in the fall.</li></ul> 

<u><strong>WHAT TO GROW IN THE SUN</strong></u>
<ul><li>New England Aster (Symphyotrichon novae-angliae) Either the species or any of the many cultivated forms (Purple Dome, Vibrant Dome, Alma Potschke to name a few) are great additions to the backyard. The blooms appearing varying shades of purple, will hold the flowers for quite some time and are absolute bee magnets.
</li><li>Black Eyed Susan (Rudbeckia fulgida) A reliable repeat bloomer nearly all summer long with cheery yellow petals surrounding a dark brown center.
</li><li>Switchgrass (Panicum virgtaum cultivars.) There are several selections on the market today which range from blue to red foliage and tight upright seedheads. (Shenandoah, Northwind, Dallas Blues). This grass is robust with fine texture and a lot of movement to it. You can combine any of these selections for a meadow like feel.
</li><li>Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea cultivars) Again, many different colors and forms available now, with long blooms and short stature. Although it is a wholesale nursery, North Creek Nursery has a wonderful website for inspiration.</li></ul>

The BBG currently has an exhibition called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020254/http://www.bbg.org/discover/natives/">Native New Yorkers</a>, which explains to visitors why putting native plants in your home gardens is the best thing you can do for NYC&#x2019;s ecosystem&#x2014;all of the above recommendations from Lorimer are native.
