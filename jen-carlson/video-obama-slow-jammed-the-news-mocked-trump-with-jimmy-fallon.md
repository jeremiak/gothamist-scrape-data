<p>President Barack Obama dropped by Jimmy Fallon&apos;s <em>Tonight Show</em> on Thursday night, where he teamed up with the host and the Roots to slow jam the news and recap all that he&apos;s done in the past 8 years. He summed up some highlights&#x2014;clean energy, the Affordable Care Act, and same sex marriage rights&#x2014;&quot;In short,&quot; Obama declared, &quot;Climate change is real, health care is affordable, and love is love.&quot;</p>

<p>Throughout the 7-minute slow jam, Obama was doled out some new nicknames by Fallon: Prez Dispenser, Commander in Preach, and Baracky with the Good Hair. And he delivered a gentle reminder that his time in the Oval can&apos;t last forever: &quot;Daddy&#x2019;s got a Hawaiian vacation booked in about 223 days.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they also got through topics like student loans, the Iran nuclear deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and Trump... &quot;I&apos;ve been watching Orange is NOT the New Black,&quot; Obama said. Watch below, and stay for the double mic drop:</p>
