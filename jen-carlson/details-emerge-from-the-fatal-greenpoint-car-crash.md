The woman hit while crossing Manhattan Avenue and India Street was 38-year-old Violetta Krzyzak, who later died at Bellevue Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153823/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/04/28/2009-04-28_brooklyn_mom_dies_in_hitrun.html">The Daily News</a> reports that she &quot;landed yards away, near the corner of Huron Street, the same block where she lived with her husband and at least one daughter.&quot; One shop owner on the street commented on the impact, saying, <strong>&quot;Her handbag was in front of my store and her body was at the end of the block.&quot;</strong> It was 28-year-old Jose Maldonado who ran a red light in an allegedly stolen minivan and hit Krzyzak. Witnesses say an unmarked police car was tailing the minivan, and while they stopped after the hit and run, Maldonado kept going only to crash into the parked cars. His record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153823/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6783692">includes other arrests for stealing cars</a> and he currently awaits charges while at Woodhull Hospital with a broken toe.</p>
