With an image of a red-suited woman wearing an anti-choice pin, the text reads: &quot;What&apos;s more limited? Your closet or her experience?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418042911/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/16/hangups_about_s.php">Last summer</a> the company hung a controversial billboard that read &quot;Your closet space is shrinking as fast as her right to choose&quot; (which included a hanger in the illustration). The new Palin poster has been up in subway cars and bus shelter kiosks for a few weeks, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418042911/http://animalnewyork.com/news/2008/10/sarah-palin-out-of-the-closet.php">Animal</a> notes that &quot;one thing&apos;s a certainty: Palin&apos;s new six-figure stumping wardrobe wouldn&apos;t come fucking close to fitting in the average Manhattan closet.&quot;</p>
