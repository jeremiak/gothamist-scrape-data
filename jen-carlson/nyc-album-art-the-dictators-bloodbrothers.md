The front is shown at right, the back can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501183744/http://tralfaz-archives.com/coverart/D/dictators_blood.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The New York punk band is said to have taken &quot;booze, testosterone and attitude (all attributes necessary to survive in the NY scene)&quot; to a &quot;legendary&quot; status. Even Bruce Springsteen is a huge fan, and can be heard counting &quot;1-2-1-2-3-4&quot; during the album&apos;s opening track, &quot;Faster and Louder.&quot;</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501183744/http://tralfaz-archives.com/coverart/D/dictators_blood.html">Album Cover Art Gallery</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The cover photos take us back to a much more simple time. It&apos;s a time when a &quot;gang&quot; hung around the school yard drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and if they was to &quot;rumble&quot; a chain and a switchblade were the weapons of choice. Now it&apos;s crack out in back of the liquor store and an AK-47 if you happen to wear the wrong color or flip off the wrong guy. Who&apos;da thought &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; would end up being nostalgically cute.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Anyone know what schoolyard this was shot in? </p>
