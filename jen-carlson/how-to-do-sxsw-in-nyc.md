title: How To Do SXSW In NYC
---

	
										<p>Next week all of your friends will be in Austin, Texas for SXSW. Listening to bands, eating queso, sipping on avocado margaritas, playing kickball in parks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315170221/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenc/115713616/in/set-72057594087066188/"><em>with kegs of beer</em></a>... BIG DEAL, except for that last thing, those are all things we can do right here in New York City too. So if you&apos;re staying in town, here&apos;s how to do SXSW without leaving the five boroughs. (We also recommend following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315170221/http://twitter.com/#!/notsxsw">Not SXSW</a> Twitter feed, they&apos;ll make you feel like you&apos;re not so alone.)</p>
