<p>Late last summer the iconic Hoboken rock club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423141540/http://gothamist.com/tags/maxwells">Maxwell&apos;s</a> closed with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423141540/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/01/farewell_to_maxwells.php#photo-1">massive block party</a>. At the time, co-owner Todd Abramson said they were priced out of the area, but didn&apos;t rule out re-opening in Jersey City. Meanwhile, the space went on the market... and it has now been sold.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423141540/http://www.nj.com/hobokennow/index.ssf/2014/01/maxwells_finally_closes_but_wi.html#incart_river_default">NJ.com</a>, the new owners will keep the name, but change the business model. The live room&#x2014;where you once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423141540/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/video_the_best_bands_played_maxwell.php">saw bands</a> like Nirvana, The Feelies, and Yo La Tengo&#x2014;will now be renovated into a dining area. New owners Evan Dean and Pete Carr delivered some soul-crushing, cringe-worthy comments on their plans, stating, <strong>&#x201C;Hoboken is changing, and it&#x2019;s time for Maxwell&#x2019;s to change. We want to be local, friendly, and affordable. You can&#x2019;t help but notice all the baby strollers on Washington Street these days. Those young families need a comfortable place to have dinner.&quot;</strong> The duo will renovate and reopen the space as a family restaurant that specializes in thin-crust artisanal pizza.</p>

<p>They are open to the idea of live entertainment (&quot;we&apos;ll see how it goes&quot;), but don&apos;t expect this with your slice:</p>
