<p>There are some people who will complain about film shoots in their neighborhoods&#x2014;to some, Steven Spielberg transforming their street into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111305/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/photos_spielberg_coens_dumbo.php">a 1950s wonderland</a> is not as magical as finding a parking spot. But if you&apos;re charmed by stumbling into a Hollywood scene as you leave your apartment, then you may want to head to the Museum of the Moving Image (one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111305/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/31/best_museums_nyc.php">our favorites</a>) this weekend, where they&apos;re celebrating that kind of thing. </p>

<p>The museum, Kaufman Astoria Studios and the Theatrical Teamsters Local 817 are hosting their &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111305/http://www.movingimage.us/visit/calendar/2016/05/22/detail/new-york-on-location">New York On Location</a>&quot; street fair on Sunday, a day-long event featuring stunt, special-effects (it will rain! it will snow!), and makeup demos; public access to 20 film trailers and trucks; Museum exhibitions about filmmaking; and more. Catering and treat trucks will be on hand to feed you. And Honey Wagons (the restrooms to the stars!) will be available for the public to use. You can also speak directly with movie professionals about what they do on set, without getting yelled at by a PA.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The film and television industry employs thousands of New Yorkers every year, from electricians to carpenters to makeup artists. And while we love seeing the magic that appears on screen, few people outside the industry can really appreciate all the work that goes into creating that magic,&#x201D; said Hal Rosenbluth, President and CEO of Kaufman Astoria Studios, where they&apos;ll be opening their backlot for this event.</p>

<p>&quot;New York on Location&quot; takes place Sunday, May 22nd, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and during that time the Museum&apos;s galleries will be free to explore. The event takes place at the Kaufman Astoria Studios backlot (36 Street, between 34 &amp; 35 Ave), Museum of the Moving Image (36-01 35 Ave), and surrounding streets.</p>
