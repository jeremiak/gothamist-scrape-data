</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023236/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> has finally taken his month-long open air street art show to a borough other than Manhattan. This morning just after 9 a.m. he posted the above image to his Instagram, with the caption: &quot;Bushwick.&quot; Now it&apos;s time to find out <em>where</em> in Bushwick.</p>

<p>But there are two other, similar pieces that also went up (which he only posted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023236/http://www.banksy.co.uk/2013/10/04/delancey-bushwick-williamsburg">his website</a>): one on Delancey Street on the LES, and another in Williamsburg.</p>

<p>As of 9:30 a.m., a call to the 1-800 number typically left by his pieces (1-800-656-4271) did not have any information about a 4th piece (which you would get to via hitting 4# when the recording prompts you for an item number). This may be added later, however.</p>

<p>Banksy just added &quot;The Musical&quot; part to tags that were already on the walls.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We hear one is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023236/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=208+Bushwick+Ave&amp;ll=40.708418,-73.939415&amp;spn=0.006498,0.011802&amp;sll=40.708907,-73.940062&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,270.6,,1,2.29&amp;cbll=40.708904,-73.940043&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=208+Bushwick+Ave,+Brooklyn,+New+York+11206&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=yP41g9iQ_DWdRFDn29aomA">208 Bushwick Avenue</a>, and one is on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023236/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=stanwix+and+renaissance+court&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.699349,-73.933643&amp;spn=0.006499,0.011802&amp;sll=40.699836,-73.934285&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,38.01,,0,16.15&amp;cbll=40.699832,-73.934283&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=Stanwix+St+%26+Renaissance+Ct,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11206&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=-RmzuNn65q_jXtmVwfrIAQ">Stanwix and Renaissance Court</a>. The LES one is at Delancey and Bowery.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 12 p.m.:</strong> There have been some rumors that the Bushwick piece on Stanwix was already buffed (confirmed, see below photo):</p>

<p>... but the one on Bushwick Avenue is still there, and the store owner is rumored to be looking in to plexiglass to preserve it.</p>
