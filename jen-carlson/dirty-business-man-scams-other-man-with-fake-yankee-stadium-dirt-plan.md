<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:220px; "> <img alt="newyankeechain0122.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160443im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newyankeechain0122.jpg" width="220" height="240"> <br> <i>Real dirt, from Amazon.com</i></div> Westport, Connecticut man Mark Hayward has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160443/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/yankee-dirt-deal-fraud-memorabilia-Connecticut-mark-hayward-137476923.html">arrested and charged</a> with first-degree larceny and third-degree forgery after attempting to market dirt he said was from the original Yankee Stadium. Oldest scam in the playbook!<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160443/http://www.thehour.com/story/518020/westport-man-charged-in-yankee-stadium-fraud">the Norwalk Hour</a>, another man claimed Hayward scammed him out of $35,000 in 2008, when he asked him to invest in a business marketing key chains filled with dirt from the former stadium. </p>

<p>At the time he was told he would receive a 20% share of the business, and he agreed, forking over the dough. He then became suspicious and a long investigation took place, eventually leading Hayward to the charges. He now has a January 23rd court date. </p>

<p>So, how do you think they test this dirt to find out if it&apos;s the real deal?</p>
