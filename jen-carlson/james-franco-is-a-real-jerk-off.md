When asked about it, he says:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I spend a fair amount of time alone, especially when I travel maybe to something like this or for work or whatever, but I&#x2019;m in hotels a lot for a lot of my life... So, when I&#x2019;m alone, <strong>I do masturbate a lot.</strong> I don&#x2019;t know why. It&#x2019;s like you have those days where it&#x2019;s just like, I have a ton of writing to do, or a ton of reading to do, and you&#x2019;re just like, OK, I&#x2019;m going to be on the couch all day or in bed all day just doing that&#x2026; <strong>I tend to have a four or five-time day.</strong>&quot;</blockquote>
 
Franco, forever the overachiever. (And maybe that&apos;s why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526082215/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/10/going_to_school_saved_james_franco.php">he was spotted</a> so tuckered out at his Columbia classes?)
