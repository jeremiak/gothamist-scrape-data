<p>Just as we have been forced to swallow words like &quot;millennial,&quot; in the 1940s the world was introduced to the &quot;teenager.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195941/http://life.time.com/popular-culture/teenagers-a-1944-photo-essay-on-a-new-american-phenomenon/#ixzz2QFrO5AMA">LIFE has a look back</a> today on that time we came to understand &quot;the modern notion of the teen years as a recognized, quantifiable life stage, complete with its own fashions, behavior, vernacular and arcane rituals.&quot; In their December 1944 article&#x2014;which focused on a group of 15 to 17-years old girls from Missouri&#x2014;the headline read: &#x201C;Teen-Age Girls: They Live in a Wonderful World of Their Own.&#x201D; But this wasn&apos;t the first time the word &quot;teen-age&quot; was printed...</p>

<p>The word &quot;teen-agers&quot; appeared in Popular Science three years earlier. In April of 1941, a columnist for that magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195941/http://books.google.com/books?id=vgPB_qDnV_UC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;dq=teen-agers+popular+science+1941&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ro7jpHfhID&amp;sig=xsJkM7i9wu7nWYgUflyYdgt4L7g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RRVoUcanA8Tk4AOu_IH4Cg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=teen-agers%20popular%20science%201941&amp;f=false">wrote</a>: &quot;I never knew teen-agers could be so serious.&quot; (LOL.)</p>

<p>By the time LIFE printed their piece, teenagers had taken over&#x2014;they wrote, &quot;There is a time in the life of every American girl when the most important ting in the world is to be one of a crowd of other girls and to act and speak and dress exactly as they do. This is the teen age. Some 6,000,000 U.S. teen-age girls live in a world all their own: a lovely, gay, enthusiastic, funny and blissful society almost untouched by the war,&quot; which they now admit was applicable &quot;to a specific type of teenager&#x2014;i.e., white, middle-class.&quot; <em>Typical trend piece.</em> They go on:</p><blockquote>&quot;It is a world of sweaters and skirts and bobby sox and loafers, of hair worn long, of eye-glass rims painted red with nail polish, of high school boys no yet gone to war. It is world still devoted to parents who are pals even if they use the telephone too much. It is a world of Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em>, second-year French and plane geometry, of class plays, field hockey, &apos;moron&apos; jokes and put-on accents. It is a world of slumber parties and the Hit Parade, of peanut butter and popcorn and the endless collecting of menus and match covers and little stuffed animals.&quot;</blockquote>You can revisit the photos from their article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195941/http://life.time.com/popular-culture/teenagers-a-1944-photo-essay-on-a-new-american-phenomenon/?iid=lb-gal-viewagn#1">here</a>.<p></p>

<p>If you click on the Popular Science <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195941/http://www.popsci.com/category/tags/teenagers">&quot;teenager&quot; tag</a> today, the archives show recent articles on teens and their brass knuckles and marijuana (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195941/http://gothamist.com/tags/waronyouth">ours isn&apos;t any better</a>)... but if the above excerpt painted a prettier picture of Youth for you, don&apos;t be fooled, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230195941/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo4V3q3BF0Y&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL19CCFDFD042010C9&amp;feature=results_main">it really wasn&apos;t all that different back then</a>... not with teenagers, and not with the way trend pieces and pop culture terminology was created and sustained.</p>
