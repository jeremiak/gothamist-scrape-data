<p>Since iPods are in that awkward not-quite-retro and not-new-anymore phase, the kids are bringing back the boombox. Decentralized Dance Party and Newmindspace (who have brought you events like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205249/http://gothamist.com/tags/pillowfight">annual pillow fight</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205249/http://gothamist.com/tags/lightsaberbattle">lightsaber battle</a>) present <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205249/http://www.newmindspace.com/boombox-party-nyc">Boombox Party NYC</a>, which is exactly what it sounds like. </p>

<p>The spontaneous (yet planned!) dance party will have participants carrying boomboxes, which will be tuned into the master broadcast. But it gets crazier! The attendees must also wear full business attire while dancing in the streets. Though how many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205249/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR4YOwaHNn4">John Cusacks</a> do you think will show up?</p>

<p>This will all go down on January 21st at 9 p.m. at a location that&apos;s not yet been disclosed. According to Laughing Squid, organizers are looking for more boomboxes and cash donations to make it all happen, and you can donate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205249/http://www.indiegogo.com/DDPNYC">right here</a>.</p>
