<p>Would you want to charge your iPod at the beach so badly that you&apos;d wear a bikini that outputs volts of electricity? It&apos;s a whole new way to get burnt at the beach! Brooklyn designer Andrew Schneider has created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116184753/http://www.andrewjs.com/solarbikini.html">the Solar Bikini</a>, which has USB sockets and is retrofitted with photovoltaic film panels sewn together in series with conductive thread. All in all there are only five volts of electricity, so you <em>probably</em> won&apos;t get electrocuted when you go to cool off in the water.</p>

<p>Schneider assured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116184753/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/24/all_solarbikini_2011_6_17_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just fine to take in the water because there&#x2019;s no energy stored by the suit and the electrical output is small. But you have to make sure you dry off completely before plugging in again or the suit won&#x2019;t function properly.&#x201D; </p>

<p>He makes each bikini as it&apos;s ordered, and sells them for $1,000! And they won&apos;t even keep your beer cool... which the male version of the suit will, as he plans to equip it with a beer-cooling pocket. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116184753/http://www.neatorama.com/2011/06/13/solar-powered-bikini/">Neatorama</a> points out, these will &quot;replace the obsolete and dangerous coal-burning bikinis of today.&quot; Also, <em>please</em> let us know if you see anyone wearing these around town.</p>
