</div></div>					<p>Last Saturday night we were standing in a sauna-like basement on Canal Street watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140429/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> on a monitor reading Rob Lowe&apos;s autobiography. Standing next to us was the real life James Franco, also watching James Franco on a monitor reading Rob Lowe&apos;s autobiography. Narcissism? Art? A long time ago we decided not to judge the art of others&#x2014;which may have had something to do with getting a fine arts scholarship to college and being immediately denigrated for our work with charcoals, or whatever. Grading art never made much sense. So we&apos;ll save our judgment for Franco&apos;s work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140429/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/08/james-franco-directs-a-fetish-porn-doc-says-his-sex-tape-sucks/">in fetish porn</a>, because if our work in the adult entertainment industry (thanks art scholarship) taught us anything, it&apos;s that you can totally judge porn, those who make it, and those who watch it. </p>

<p>That said, we present without comment some photos from the opening night, along with the appropriate information you&apos;ll need to make your own decision to go, or not to go. It&apos;s liberating isn&apos;t it?! The show, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150926140429/http://asiasongsociety.com/newsite/">High/Low, Rob Lowe</a>, will be running through August 28th at Terence Koh&apos;s Asia Song Society at 45 Canal Street. Here&apos;s what you&apos;ll see...</p>

<p>The installation features film and video work by Franco, exploring &quot;the numerous ways in which we view, absorb, process, and re-interpret media.&quot; You already know what awaits you in the basement (though the real Franco won&apos;t be around, he&apos;s a busy guy!), but in another room you&apos;ll discover Three&apos;s Company: The Drama. This is &quot;an installation premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival [which] strips the beloved 1970&#x2019;s sitcom of its laugh track and overlays the original footage with a kitschy, sexualized reenactment, thus deconstructing the light-heartedness of daytime television and questioning our easy identification with the drama&#x2019;s environments and characters.&quot; </p>

<p>Other areas hold television sets and projection screens that show &quot;unseen footage recorded by Franco on iPhone and 8mm film in a fluid stream of environments&#x2014; from the raw Utah landscape of <em>127 Hours</em> to university campuses to his frequent car journeys.&quot; It&apos;s the Total James-Franco-As-Self-Exposing-Artist Experience you&apos;ve been waiting for.</p>
