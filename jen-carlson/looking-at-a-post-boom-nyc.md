He warns that &quot;New York has been on what you could call the &#x2018;plutonomy wagon.&#x2019; So <strong>New York has been the ultimate trickle-down economy&#x2014;it&#x2019;s been a relatively small group of people driving the economy.</strong> The skills of New York are still here; the roots of some of the industries are still here. But, unless many things are grown to replace this plutonomy, the city&#x2019;s going to continue to go through this spiral where it becomes more and more bifurcated&#x2014;there are no middle-class jobs, except in the plutonomy.&quot; His solution: look to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141019063424/http://sfist.com/">San Francisco</a> as a model! Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141019063424/http://Chicagoist.com/">Chicago</a>, though all he really says about the Windy City is that they have good PR.</p>
