                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="OWSNEWSROOM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/OWSNEWSROOM.jpg" width="640" height="368" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>A big background story going on in this season&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/http://gothamist.com/tags/thenewsroom"><em>The Newsroom</em></a> is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/http://gothamist.com/tags/ows">Occupy Wall Street</a>, which <em>News Night</em> staffer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/http://thenewsroom.wikia.com/wiki/Neal_Sampat">Neal Sampat</a> becomes interested in before the movement becomes front page news, and his coworkers are still laughing it off. In last night&apos;s episode, Sampat heads to Zuccotti Park after hearing Radiohead is playing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/01/radiohead_fails_to_occupy_wall_stre.php#photo-1">but we all know how that went</a>. While he doesn&apos;t get to witness Thom Yorke dancing amongst the Occupiers, he get arrested, and it does get captured on video. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/08/nypd_spokesman_calls_reporters_arre.php">Pretty realistic stuff</a>! But next week, after Sampat <em>really</em> gains the trust of his Occupier pal, Shelly Wexler (who the real OWS believes is based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/https://twitter.com/alexisgoldstein">Alexis Goldstein</a>), she comes on the show and is basically destroyed by Will McAvoy on live television. Watch here: </p>

<p>So what does the real OWS have to say about Sorkin&apos;s small screen version? They were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/https://twitter.com/occupywallstnyc">Tweeting</a> last night, and put a post up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/http://occupywallstreet.net/story/newsroom-season-2-gets-occupied-0">on their blog</a> addressing the show. They refer to Ms. Goldstein saying she &quot;certainly isn&#x2019;t our leader, she is great at explaining why the Wall Street banks deserve our anger.&quot; Here is one of her appearances:</p>

<p>The real life OWS &quot;editorial team&quot; has taken time to answer McAvoy&apos;s questions, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822175140/http://occupywallstreet.net/story/newsroom-season-2-gets-occupied-0">read here</a>&#x2014;here&apos;s one, along with some other thoughts from those involved in the movement. </p>

<blockquote><strong>Q: What&#x2019;s your best case scenario for how this ends?</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Scripted answer:</strong> That it doesn&#x2019;t end.
<br><br>
<strong>Our real answer:</strong> We don&apos;t see this ending in our lifetimes. It won&apos;t end until we see real systemic change.</blockquote>
