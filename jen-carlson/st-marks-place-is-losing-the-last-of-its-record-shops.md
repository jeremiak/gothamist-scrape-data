										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sounds15.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072510im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sounds15.jpg" width="640" height="425" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The stretch of St. Mark&apos;s between 2nd and 3rd Avenues used to be home to plenty of record shops: Joe&apos;s CDs, 13 CDs, Venus Records, Mondo Kim&apos;s, Smash, Norman&apos;s, Rockit Scientist Records... and Sounds.</p>

<p>While word of Sounds closure began circulating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072510/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/14/st_marks_place_record_shop_sounds_i.php">in February 2014</a>, they&apos;ve been keeping things going in their St. Mark&apos;s storefront since then. Until now. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072510/http://evgrieve.com/2015/09/the-last-record-store-on-st-marks-place.html">EV Grieve</a>, the shop is currently hosting their final sale, and the inside is already pretty barren. It&apos;s unclear who is moving into the property, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072510/http://www.loopnet.com/Listing/18547487/20-St-Marks-Place-New-York-NY/">the listing</a> gleefully declared: &quot;Rare Opportunity!!! Available first time in 30 plus years.&quot;</p>

<p>When news of their demise was first announced last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072510/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303650204579377163727216956">the WSJ</a> reported, &quot;Sounds, the last of once-many record shops on the strip, recently limited its business days to Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays... [the] space went on the rental market this month, with its first showings this week.&quot;</p>

<p>It wasn&apos;t really the last record shop back then, however, there was still Rainbow Records&#x2014;but even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072510/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/birdman_east_village_cds.php">Birdman is shutting down</a> his longtime CD store this month. And soon, St. Mark&apos;s could become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072510/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/06/24/investor-arthur-shapolsky-in-contract-for-50m-east-village-site/">Development City</a>.</p>
