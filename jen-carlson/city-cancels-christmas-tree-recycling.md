<p>If you didn&apos;t bring your Christmas tree to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422193745/http://gothamist.com/tags/mulchfest">Mulchfest</a> and left it on the curb thinking it would be recycled... think again. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422193745/http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2011/jan/11/sanitation-workers-say-we-dont-have-time-recycle-your-christmas-trees/">WNYC</a>, those trees are going straight in the trash. A Department of Sanitation spokesperson told them that the annual Christmas tree recycling program was canceled this year after the department became overwhelmed by the December 26th blizzard. Christine Datz-Romero at the Lower East Side Ecology Center says this falls into a common pattern: &quot;Whenever we have an emergency, recycling suffers.&quot; Hear that Mother Nature, next time you Blizzardgeddon us think of your precious trees first. </p>

<p>If you want to give your dead tree some meaning, Datz-Romero suggests recycling a few branches of your tree by layering them in tree pits with this debris to help insulate them during the next storm.<br>
