<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smogdon04512.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235217im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smogdon04512.jpeg" width="225" height="192" class="image-left"> </span><strong>[UDPATE BELOW]</strong> In 2009 we looked back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235217/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/24/smog.php#photo-1">the city&apos;s history of toxic smog</a>, wondering &quot;if an upcoming season of <em>Mad Men</em> might revolve around the smog problem in 1966.&quot; And last night we had our answer: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235217/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen">Don Draper &amp; Co.</a> were submerged in a sea of smog, unable to open the windows. The only mention of the smog is when Megan tells Don, &quot;The radio said there&apos;s a smog emergency. The air&apos;s toxic. I don&apos;t want that in here.&quot; In the world Matthew Weiner&apos;s created, this is less about the historical reference point and much more about <em>symbolism</em>, however, the smog did cause real problems for real New Yorkers of the time. </p>

<p>As we pointed out three years ago, the smoggiest day the city experienced that year was on November 24th (in <em>Mad Men</em> it&apos;s mentioned as Megan is preparing Thanksgiving dinner), and there are varying reports that the smog killed anywhere from 169 to 400 people in the city that year. It&apos;s also worth noting that some attribute the 1953 smog to Dylan Thomas&apos;s death, as he had pre-existing chest problems... something that Don can likely relate to, being a chain smoker.</p>

<p>The EPA released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235217/http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20013P7R.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=Prior%20to%201976&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=%28manhattan%29%20OR%20FNAME%3D%2220013P7R.txt%22%20AND%20FNAME%3D%2220013P7R.txt%22&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C70THRU75%5CTXT%5C00000005%5C20013P7R.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1">this document</a> on the Thanksgiving smog of that year, which included this table on the air quality that November.</p>

<p>In the below clip, one New York City housewife has a less scientific breakdown of the smog, noting that &quot;it all seems to be coming from over there in New Jersey.&quot;</p>

<p>The smog even crossed over into the music world, when the Beach Boys&apos; Brian Wilson ranted about the condition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504235217/http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2010/09/20/brian-wilson-l-a-smog-spoken-word/">in the 1970s</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;ll have more on the rest of the reference points from last night&apos;s <em>Mad Men</em> episode later: from Manischewitz to Weight Watchers to Sno Balls.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The amazing folks at the NYPL have unearthed The NY Times edition from November 27th, 1966, which featured these before and after photos of the smog that took over Manhattan...</p>

<p>And here&apos;s the full front page, which states that most people followed restrictions during the smog, and claims that &quot;no illnesses attributed to pollution&quot;:</p>
