										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="Gblossoms1113.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140015im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/Gblossoms1113.jpg" width="300" height="253" class="image-right"> </span>The Gin Blossoms have embarked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140015/http://www.ginblossoms.net/tour-dates">on a tour</a> for... some reason. Why not? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140015/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/gin_blossoms.php">Sometimes they play shows</a>, it&apos;s just what musicians do, even if they don&apos;t have a new album to promote or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140015/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/mark_mcgrath_cancels_90s_cruise.php">Mark McGrath Cruise Ship</a> to rock. And this Thursday, November 21st they&apos;re playing Stage 48 in Manhattan, with all proceeds going to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140015/http://ushare.redcross.org.ph/">Philippine Red Cross</a> relief efforts for victims and survivors of Typhoon Haiyan. At press time it&apos;s unclear if Gin Blossoms were ever called The Nice Guys Of Nostalgia Rock, but <em>we&apos;re going with it.</em></p>

<blockquote>&quot;Gin Blossoms would like to encourage their friends and fans to make a monetary donation&#x2014;&apos;Any amount our fans and friends can afford will offer much relief to affected families fast,&apos; says Robin. &apos;We performed in Manila less than a month ago. It&apos;s so tragic that this has affected so many of those wonderful people,&apos; says Jesse.
 
The Philippine Red Cross have localized on-the-ground networks and knowledge of local communities and their needs. As a result, they are often best positioned to extend the supply chain of relief to the hardest hit local communities quickly and accurately.&quot;</blockquote>
 
So, if you ever wanted to hear their best song (not &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot;) live, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140015/http://www.ginblossoms.net/212-gin-blossoms-rockin-for-philippines">do it this Thursday</a>.
