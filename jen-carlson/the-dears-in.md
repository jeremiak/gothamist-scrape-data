A sextet from Montreal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424125657/http://www.thedears.org/">the Dears</a> create a new sound through old influences. A whirlwind of sonance reminiscent of The Smiths, Belle &amp; Sebastian, Serge Gainsbourg, the Kinks and a list that could go on forever. Brit pop, french pop, art rock. Lyrics and drama that create orchestral anthems for a new age. 
With ten years behind them the Dears are ready to descend upon us as more than just another band in the Canadian contingent, as more than just a band that sometimes sounds like Morrissey.
The Dears are George (drums), Martin (bass), Murray (vox), Natalia (keys), Valerie (keys), Patrick (guitar). This week Murray Lightburn took some time to answer our questions...

</p><p><b>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</b><br>
I was on the phone with my best friend and we thought it would do. Only now do I realize that it&apos;s something I actually want to be.</p>

<p><b>What is your first conscious memory of New York? </b><br>
When I was eight or something, I found money on the ground on Utica Avenue.</p>

<p><b>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York? </b><br>
My least fave would have to be, of course, getting our van broken into, stuff stolen, and having to go to the store and spend money replacing shit so we could do the gig that night.<br>
My fave would be the time when I was eight...</p>

<p><b>What is your favorite/least favorite thing about playing shows in New York? </b><br>
We don&apos;t mind playing New York. I always go for a Chinese massage on Grand. </p>
