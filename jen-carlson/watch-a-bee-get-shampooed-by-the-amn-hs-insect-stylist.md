<p>Swarms of bees have come through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108081107/http://gothamist.com/tags/amnh">the American Museum of Natural History</a>, and each one gets a shampoo and blow-out upon arrival. The Museum has posted a run-down of the process <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108081107/http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/from-the-collections-posts/buzz-cut-bee-styling-for-posterity">on their website</a>, noting that &quot;the bee specimens in the Museum&#x2019;s Division of Invertebrate Zoology are treated to a day of beautification before they join the research collection.&quot; </p>

<p>Why? The bees are often stored in alcohol when collected in the field, but researchers prefer them dry, so they&apos;re put into a vial of shampoo, shaken up, and washed off. Here&apos;s a little more on the process, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108081107/http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/from-the-collections-posts/buzz-cut-bee-styling-for-posterity">the AMNH</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The hair of bees, which helps many species gather pollen, has to be immaculately &#x201C;styled&#x201D; so that their anatomical features are best preserved for scientists to study. Curatorial Assistant Melody Doering is the Museum&#x2019;s go-to insect stylist.

<p>As with any visit to the salon, this starts with a good shampoo. Doering adds a single drop of soap to a vial of water, drawing a tiny bee bath. With a pair of tweezers, she gently removes the specimen from its field transport jar and places it in the soapy solution. A shake or two and a brief soak is all that&#x2019;s needed to clean the alcohol from the bee&#x2019;s fine hairs.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In order to get them dry, a makeshift bee dryer is used&#x2014;something akin to a bicycle pump. The Museum tells us, &quot;They have only done about 100 of these. They only need to wash specimens unfortunate enough to be preserved in alcohol; and, luckily, most do not come that way.&quot;</p>

<p>The Museum is pretty serious about bees, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108081107/http://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/resources/collections-databases/bee-database-project">launched a Bee Database Project</a> over a decade ago, with specimen records entered into their Invertebrate Zoology Divisional Database. Their bee efforts have even helped identify <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108081107/http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/news-posts/museum-collections-help-identify-four-new-species-of-bees-in-new-york-city">four new species of bee in New York City</a>.</p>
