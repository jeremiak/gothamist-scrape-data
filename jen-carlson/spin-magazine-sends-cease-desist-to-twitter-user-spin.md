<p>SPIN Magazine has sent an Oregon man, Eric Rice, a cease &amp; desist letter demanding that he give up his Twitter handle: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031942/http://twitter.com/#!/spin">@SPIN</a>. They write that his Twitter account is causing a significant amount of confusion among their client&apos;s customers, who are &quot;redirected to @SPIN&quot; (the magazine&apos;s handle is @SPINmagazine&#x2014;which <em>is</em> the first thing to come up if one Googles &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031942/http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=spin+twitter&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-v1g-m3&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=dd1c585db5dd79e7">spin twitter</a>&quot;).</p>

<p>The magazine uses examples where important transmissions referring to their magazine have nearly been lost, like: &quot;Wow @timesnewviking&apos;s newie Dancer Equired has scored 8/10 in @spin magazine. fair do&apos;s!&quot; Maybe people should just learn how to use the Google machine and/or Twitter? Regardless, ping pong club SPiN NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430031942/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/01/video_ping_pong_appears_to_be_great.php#photo-1">better watch its back, too</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted both SPIN and @SPIN for comment, and will update when we hear back. In the meantime, do you think it&apos;s fair for a big company to go after someone for a Twitter handle? </p>
