<p>We&apos;ve all seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152148/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/02/photos_first_dip_in_summer_streets.php#photo-1">dumpster pools</a>, and even a guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152148/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/video_man_turns_dumpster_into_brook.php">living in a dumpster</a>, but let&apos;s all agree that we can take this dumpster thing <em>further</em> still. Dumpster culture hasn&apos;t fully developed, not until we all have a dumpster we literally call home. And with that, we urge you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152148/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/851648659/inflato-dumpster">support this Kickstarter</a> for the Inflato Dumpster.</p>

<p>These New Yorkers want to &quot;create an inflatable learning space inside of a dumpster that is open to all,&quot; noting that &quot;public space in New York [has] become increasingly privatized and commodified.&quot; Their Inflato Dumpster will be opened for five days this fall&#x2014;&quot;we aim to take advantage of the mobile, temporary nature of the Inflato Dumpster to pop-up in areas that we love, neighborhoods where we live and around the people and communities that we know.&quot; Okay, just let us know when we can live in one.</p>

<p>For now, Joaquin Reyes (co-founder of the project, along with John Locke) told us, &quot;I think we are going to push the boundaries for what a dumpster can be used for. It would be amazing to find other uses such as redesigning them into living space.&quot;</p>
