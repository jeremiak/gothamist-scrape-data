With their highly infectious melodies from female lead vocalist Nirmala Basnayake they prove that they are more than just the latest band to jump on the dancepunk bandwagon. Recalling the best of female rock vocalists from Debbie Harry to Chrissie Hynde, Nirmala&apos;s voice alternates from anxious and angry to pure sonic tenderness as the four boys behind her laydown seriously solid songs of punishing rhythm and dueling angular guitar work. Bust out your dancing shoes because with their nonstop four-on-the-floor disco beats and raging basslines, you won&apos;t be able to stand still for long. </p>

<p>Nirmala recently took some time out to answer some questions for Gothamist...</p>

<p><b>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did you band name originate? </b> </p>

<p>&quot;controller.controller&quot; is the name of a Shotmaker song. We kept the odd punctuation and non-caps style intact. Ronnie brought the longest list of band names to the table - literally, because we really were sitting around a table when the decision was made - and this was the one we hated the least. We have grown to love it. </p>

<p><b>This is only your second trip to New York. Are you excited to be back? </b> </p>

<p>Yes! We get to stay at the Off Soho Suites again!</p>

<p><b>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York? </b> </p>

<p>My very favorite personal memory involving New York is my first date with my husband (February 5, 2003). We had a fake birthday dinner at Rose of Bombay, went to see the Dismemberment Plan, and stayed up for twenty-five hours riding various subway lines and hanging out by the ocean on Coney Island. My favorite band memory is walking around the city by myself on one of our off days during our last trip, then meeting up with drummer Jeff, manager Linda and pal Catonia on a quest for ice cream. We ended up eating Magnolia cake.</p>
