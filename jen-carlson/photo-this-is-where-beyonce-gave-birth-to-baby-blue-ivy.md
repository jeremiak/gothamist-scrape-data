<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200447/http://gothamist.com/tags/blueivy">Baby Blue Ivy</a> is just five days old, and she&apos;s been in the headlines each of those days <em>and</em> become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200447/http://www.billboard.com/#/column/chartbeat/blue-ivy-carter-youngest-person-ever-to-1005846902.story">the youngest person</a> to ever appear on the Billboard charts. So what&apos;s next for this little lady? Today, the focus is back on Jay-Z and Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s Lenox Hill Hospital stay, where Baby Blue arrived last Saturday. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200447/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/n-y-state-health-department-launches-probe-mistreatment-parents-beyonce-hospital-stay-article-1.1004654">the Daily News</a>, the Department of Health has now reviewed two complaints that the hospital gave the famous family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200447/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/beyonce_jay-z_and_lenox_hill_hospit.php">special treatment</a>, which allegedly prevented non-famous parents from seeing their own newborns. And those claims have been... dismissed! Peter Constantakes, a spokesman for the DoH, said yesterday, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not necessarily an investigation. It could be a review. Most likely in this case, it would be an investigation.&#x201D; While they don&apos;t go into details about one parent&apos;s complaints (likely Neil Nash-Coulon, who from day one said he had trouble visiting with his premature newborn twins), they say that &quot;in one case, the person who lodged the complaint admitted he had not been in the hospital at the time, but was complaining about what he had read in the newspaper.&quot;</p>

<p>But who cares about all that when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200447/http://photos.tmz.com/galleries/beyonces_hospital_room_like_a_5star_hotel#tab=most_recent">TMZ</a> has photos from the private suite that may or may not have been custom built for the couple! The site notes that the hospital constructed the suite for VIPs, and it includes &quot;flat screen TV&apos;s, state of the art electronics, a kitchenette, nice art, mahogany walls and plush furnishings.&quot; Sources told them that the suite wasn&apos;t created specifically for the Carter family, but it was intended that they&apos;d be the first to use it.</p>
