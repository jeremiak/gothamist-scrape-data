<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711012435/http://gothamist.com/tags/cyclone">The Cyclone</a> isn&apos;t the only famous wooden rollercoaster to grace <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711012435/http://gothamist.com/tags/coneyisland">Coney Island</a>&#x2014;in 1925 the Thunderbolt was built, and it kept on operating all the way through 1982. And while it was demolished in 2000, there is now a plan to bring it back to life. Today Luna Park and the city&#x2019;s Economic Development Corp announced the return of the coaster, which will happen in 2014. </p>

<p>We were told this morning that &quot;the new coaster will stand on the original Thunderbolt&#x2019;s site, and will hit speeds of 65 mph, with a 125 foot drop, which surpasses the legendary 86-year-old Cyclone&#x2019;s speed of 60 mph, and its 85 foot drop.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711012435/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/coast_coast_at_coney_SeYP1LwQEAHvCnC6I9WoCO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">the NY Post</a> notes that it will include &quot;backward loops and corkscrew turns.&quot; Valerio Ferrari, president of Zamperla USA, which will build and operate the $10 million ride, declared: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing like it in Coney Island right now, and people are going to love it.&quot;<br>
 <br>
While the new coaster may be sleeker and faster, can it really compare with the vintage version, which was immortalized in Woody Allen&apos;s 1977 classic <em>Annie Hall</em>?</p>
