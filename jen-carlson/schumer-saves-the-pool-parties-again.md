(Photo by Jen Carlson/Gothamist)</span></i></div> Just days after the Open Space Alliance (OSA) sent out a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130802/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/18/osa_cancels_last_pool_party_blames.php">finger-pointing press release</a> announcing the final Pool Parties show was canceled, thanks to JellyNYC&apos;s inability to pay the bills, <em>another</em> press release has been sent out. This time it&apos;s from Chuck Schumer&apos;s camp, and declares that the Senator &quot;has brought the two sides together to resolve the dispute that threatened the final concert.&quot; Thanks, Dad!<p></p>

<p>The release notes that starting last Tuesday, Schumer dropped everything and <em>was on this</em>, bringing both sides to the negotiating table for <em>three days of discussions</em>, at the end of which Jelly made the necessary payments to the OSA, allowing the show to go on. Schumer says, &quot;the ultimate beneficiary from these shows is the New York city economy because it is cultural magnets like this that make young people from around the country want to live here.&quot; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420130802/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/last-pool-parties-show-in-brooklyn-reinstated/">the NY Times</a>, two local businesses helped chip in: Norman and Elaine Brodsky, owners of CitiStorage; and Douglaston Development, which is building the Edge.</p>

<p>The OSA and Jelly have been at odds for a while now, so the future beyond the 29th is uncertain. The parties may have been successfully hijacked by the OSA now that they&apos;ve managed to shake all the loose change from Jelly&apos;s pockets. The two have also disagreed about lineups, with the OSA not allowing bands to be booked who use too much foul language.</p>

<p>As for next week&apos;s lineup, it includes Delorean, Dominique Young Unique, and a special guest headliner yet to be announced. After that, OSA board member Adam Perlmutter says they &quot;look forward to presenting diverse programming in the future, from Chromeo to Copland.&#x201D; With the gloves off, next week&apos;s show should be... interesting.</p>
