That means you&apos;ll be able to journey back to the glory days when the Ramones, Talking Heads, and Patti Smith were all taking the stage at the famous venue. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521143951/http://www.billboard.com/news/exclusive-cbgb-film-to-chronicle-birthplace-1005185352.story#/news/exclusive-cbgb-film-to-chronicle-birthplace-1005185352.story">Billboard</a>, the birth of punk rock in New York City will be chronicled by producers Brad Rosenberger, Randall Miller, Jody Savin and Kristal&apos;s daughter Lisa Kristal Burgman; the film is tentatively titled <em>CBGB</em>.</p>

<p>Savin, who is directing, says, &quot;It was an old-fashioned salon in an awful part of New York where people could fail while they worked to find their voice. [Kristal] provided a voice to the disenfranchised. It&apos;s a heroic and flawed story.&quot;&#x2028;&#x2028;</p>

<p>While the team has already started interviewing artists who were a part of the scene, filming likely won&apos;t start until later this year. Until then, enjoy some vintage &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;:</p>
