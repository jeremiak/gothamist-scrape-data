</div></div>					<p>Yesterday we noted that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231749/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/27/highbridge_park_path_reopened.php">the Highbridge Park path</a> was unveiled after undergoing a $4.2 million makeover. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231749/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/highbridge/html/highbridge.html">The High Bridge</a>, which the has been closed for around 30 years, will undergo a $60 million renovation and will reopen as a pedestrian bridge.  The bridge connects Manhattan and the Bronx and is located at 174th and Amsterdam Ave in Highbridge Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231749/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/highbridgepark">in Manhattan</a> and at West 170th, University Avenue &amp; Highbridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231749/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/X120/">in the Bronx</a>.  Besides the access trail from 165th and Edgecombe Avenue, the a staircase leading to the High Bridge Water Tower was also restored. </p>

<p>The High Bridge was, according to the city, the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231749/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct">aqueduct</a> of its kind in the United States and brought potable water from the Croton River in Westchester to Manhattan.  Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231749/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/virtual_tour/croton_aqueduct/index.html">virtual tour of the Old Croton Water Trail</a>.</p>
