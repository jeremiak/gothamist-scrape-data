<p>Through the letters, Chapman attempts to befriend Spiro, saying he feels close to him since their hours together on the night of Lennon&apos;s murder, December 8th, 1980. One letter reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I am glad that we can keep in touch. I&apos;ll not forget the first time we met. Besides wanting to be your friend, there are two reasons for this first letter. First, is there any way that you can help me locate my copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> that was taken from me on the night of my arrest? Second, in the patrol car on the way to the stationhouse, I remember you telling your partner&#x2014;very excitedly&#x2014;that you KNEW something big was going to happen to you on that evening. Do you remember this? I would like you to tell me more of this if possible.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>He also requests that Spiro read <em>The Catcher In The Rye</em> so he can tell him what he thinks of it; &quot;As you remember, in the copy that was taken from me I had written &apos;This is my statement&apos;. I am wondering if you now understand this.&quot;</p>

<p>Spiro&#x2014;who says he wrote a few letters in reply to Chapman&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130221041516/http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/17/us/new-york-chapman-letters/index.html?hpt=us_c1">told CNN</a>, &quot;They&apos;ve been in my possession for 30 years, and I&apos;m 66 years old, and I&apos;m saying, you know, what am I going to do with these things? So I figured I&apos;d sell them.&quot; The letters will be on sale for $75,000, and be available sometime today.</p>
