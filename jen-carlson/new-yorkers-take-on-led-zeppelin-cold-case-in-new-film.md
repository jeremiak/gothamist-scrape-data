It&apos;s a short film that will pay homage to Led Zeppelin and their fans, as well as everyone who just likes a rip roaring good story with snappy dialogue.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, the film won&apos;t really crack the case open, but perhaps it can help bring some closure to the bajillionares who never got back their dough.</p>
