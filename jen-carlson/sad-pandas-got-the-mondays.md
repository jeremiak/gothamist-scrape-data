<p>It hasn&apos;t even been a week since we last checked in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529222238/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/26/spotted_sad_panda.php">with Sad Panda</a>, but readers have been flooding our inbox with their old photos of the lovable bear spotted on the subway, in Times Square, and all over the city&apos;s mean streets. The two above photos, however, were taken <em>just moments ago</em> in what appears to be our subject&apos;s natural habitat: the Financial District. More specifically, he was sitting on his stool at Bowling Green and Broadway, south of the Charging Bull. Life isn&apos;t all bamboo and blog love, however, looking more down and out than usual, it&apos;s apparent that even Sad Panda can get a case of the Mondays.</p>
