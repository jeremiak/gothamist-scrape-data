										<p>Merging urban exploration with something akin to La Blogotheque&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145144/http://www.blogotheque.net/takeawayshows">Take Away Shows</a>, the below video gives a glimpse at what&apos;s hidden in the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel underneath Downtown Brooklyn while performer Greg &quot;Cosmo D&quot; Heffernan scores the journey.</p>

<p>The video is part of an online magazine called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145144/http://www.nymoon.com/">NY Moon</a>. Each month there are several features including one called &quot;Blueprint&quot; which proposes new ideas for NYC. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145144/http://www.nymoon.com/publications/0108/blueprint.php">In February&apos;s issue</a> someone suggests New York&apos;s billionaires buy up advertising space on the subways to allow for art and other projects; &quot;One station in Queens might allow Swoon and other so-called street artists curate. Another might choose to paint a blue waterline where the floods from melted icecaps might reach.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145144/http://nypress.com/">NY Press</a>]</p>
