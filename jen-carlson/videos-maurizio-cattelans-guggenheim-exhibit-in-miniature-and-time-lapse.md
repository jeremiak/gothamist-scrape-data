---

	
										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152607/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/maurizio-cattelan-all">Maurizio Cattelan exhibit</a> currently housed inside the Guggenheim (you can&apos;t miss it), will be on view through January 22nd, and the museum has just offered up this neat video showing Cattelan using a one-twelfth-scale model of the building to help visualize the installation. Along with the miniature rotunda, he used maquettes of artworks to prepare for hanging the objects. Most likely he used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152607/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/aw_look_at_these_mini_guggenheims.php">one of these foam-core miniatures</a>.</p>

<p>There&apos;s also a Maurizio Cattelan app, that the museum describes as &quot;interactive and multiplatform,&quot; featuring &quot;dramatic views of the museum&#x2019;s unprecedented site-specific installation along with extensive documentation of Cattelan&#x2019;s artworks, actions, and other projects.&quot; John Waters introduces the app <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152607/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/maurizio-cattelan-all/download-the-app">in this video</a>, which he notes may seem unorthodox, but sort of fitting, as Cattelan is hailed as a &quot;provocateur, prankster, and tragic poet of our times.&quot;</p>

<p>And here&apos;s some bonus footage: a time lapse of the real installation...</p>
