Now, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003249/http://www.myspace.com/extralifetheband">Extra Life</a>, Looker creates what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003249/http://stereogum.com/archives/band-to-watch/new-extra-life-blackmail-blues-the-refrain_009654.html">Stereogum</a> calls &quot;a mesmerizing form of avant-rock raga.&quot; Today he plays at our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003249/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/17/gothamist_house_come_and_knock_on_o.php">Gothamist House</a> show, and we highly recommend coming to check the set out.

<p><strong>What is the band name &quot;Extra Life&quot; all about? Video game reference? Metaphysical allusion? And how does it relate to the music you make?</strong> I was attracted to the phrase &quot;Extra Life&quot; because, although it comes from video games, it can also have a mystical vibe of reincarnation. For me creative activity, particularly live performance, is like a death and rebirth. In a live show, the performer suicidally ends his Real Life and creates her Extra Life, a ghost which is artificial and therefore more powerful than the Real. The Real Life is necessary, true, and heavy with the substance of integrity. The Extra Life is unnecessary, false, and light with the playful violence of haunting. That&apos;s why I&apos;m into it. When I perform, it&apos;s not me. It&apos;s a constructed, hyper-intense, Extra version of me. I don&apos;t technically need it to live. It&apos;s just... &quot;fun&quot;(?) To me, the Real in music means composition, execution, notes, rhythms, music&apos;s interior, its depth. It also means honesty and personal expression. The Extra in music means the shiny seductive surface of attitude, persona, magic and vibe. I want music to have both, of course. But I named the band Extra Life because I wanted to shift the focus away from Real deep musical &quot;quality&quot; and more toward the indulgent, flattened 2D golden halo that hovers around it.</p>

<p><strong>If you could have one visual artist throughout history &quot;paint&quot; your music who would it be? Why?</strong> I don&apos;t know the names of any specific artists from this period, but I&apos;m thinking of Byzantine art. I love all Medieval art. One reason is simply the spirit of severe conviction inherent in any religious art. However, in Byzantine art this devotion is expressed in the most opulent, luxurious, excessive way. To me, this ties in with the idea of Extra Life. The Byzantines are expressing something serious and deep to them, but with such lavish excess that the voluptuousness of the aesthetic eclipses the religious worship they are trying to pay. In other words, the surface threatens the depth. Plus, the rendering of perspective isn&apos;t realistic yet. So the work is all surface. An intense, radiant, two-dimensional expanse of flat golden halos.</p>
