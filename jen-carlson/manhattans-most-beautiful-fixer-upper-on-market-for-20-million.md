</div></div>					<p>This beautiful piece of real estate may be totally gutted, but look at all that potential! For just $19.9 million you can make this 10,000-square-foot penthouse at 15 Park Row your own. Located on the 26th and 27th floors of the building, the space includes not one, but <em>two</em> three-story cupolas. Your friends and neighbors with just one cupola will be so jealous! </p>

<p>Then one day when you get married you can make his and hers cupolas and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710102855/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/garden/living-together-with-one-condition-his-and-hers-houses.html">the NY Times will write a trend piece</a> on how couples like to have their own living spaces and your cupolas will become a symbol of the changing face of marriage. You&apos;re so on trend! But also maybe you just hate your spouse? </p>

<p>Eventually, the cupolas you each decorated and made your own will become the only part of your penthouse that you ever use anymore. You&apos;ll hole up there, become a recluse, pay a local neighborhood kid to bring up your newspapers and favorite candies. You&apos;ll grow old there, alone, and one day you&apos;ll gaze upon the other cupola&#x2014;it looks farther away than it used to. &quot;I wonder if he&apos;s still alive,&quot; you&apos;ll wonder after you notice the lights haven&apos;t flicked on for weeks.</p>

<p>If this kind of future sounds good to you, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710102855/http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/1045771-condo-15-park-row-fultonseaport-new-york?email=true">contact</a> broker Adam Modlin of the Modlin Group.</p>
