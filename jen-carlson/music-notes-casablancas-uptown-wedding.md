<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811071950/http://www.gothamist.com/images/2005_02_artscasablancasj.jpg"><img alt="2005_02_artscasablancasj.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811071950im_/http://www.gothamist.com/images/2005_02_artscasablancasj-thumb.jpg" width="101" height="72" align="right" hspace="5"></a>We wanted to wait to post this until after curfew so that any prepubescent fans wouldn&apos;t try to stop the wedding. Earlier today Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas tied the knot to Juliet Joslin. A collective whimper was heard below 14th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811071950/http://www.gawker.com/news/culture/music/strokes-attache-juliet-joslin-to-ironically-wear-white-031185.php">Photos of dress shopping</a> surfaced last month, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811071950/http://www.nypost.com/gossip/38699.htm">confusion as to which Stroke was getting married</a>.<br>
The reception was at Tavern on the Green...the Strokes may have a downtown sound but they are, after all, prep school educated and upper class groomed. Chin chin to the new age of rock royalty, we wish the couple the best. </p>
