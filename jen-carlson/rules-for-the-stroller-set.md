<p>Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104546/http://meanderthal.typepad.com/dope/2008/02/rules-of-the-ro.html">Park Slope blogger</a> is pushing the stroller feud even further with a post on stroller rules (featuring illustrations!). This particular &quot;prammer&quot; states: &quot;there are enough jerks out there to give us all a bad name. To combat these sidewalk simpletons, I propose the following pramming penalties be implemented immediately.&quot;</p>

Perhaps signs like the above, yet aimed at <em>all</em> pedestrians, should be posted in high foot traffic areas. </p>
