</div></div>					<p>As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051124/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704140104575057350802155846.html?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_5">Wall Street Journal</a> delves into the mystery of artist Mr. Brainwash upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051124/http://www.operagallery.com/ny/ny5/gallery/">the opening</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051124/http://blog.theartcollectors.com/2010/02/12/mr-brainwash-icons/">of his lavish show</a> here in NYC&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051124/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/02/banksys-living-performance-art-opens-show-in-nyc">others</a> who are less confused (and less amused) by the artist are using this time to sit back and say &quot;meh.&quot; But for those who are intrigued, here&apos;s what we (think we) know.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainwash <em>isn&apos;t</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051124/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>. He does, however, display works that bear more than a passing resemblance to Banksy&apos;s stuff. And he is the subject of the <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051124/http://sundance.bside.com/2010/films/spotlightsurprise_sundance2010;jsessionid=65E6C9D3DA62EE7A3ABF100D2FF4F0CB">Exit Through the Gift Shop</a></em>, a much buzzed about documentary at Sundance this year that was directed by Banksy. They are, allegedly, friends. Mr. B is also the cousin of French street artist Space Invader; but it&apos;s believed that Banksy is the one who got him into street art. How does he have all the money to create life-sized NYC taxi cab Matchbox cars? Well, Banksy could be helping to fund him... and then there are his wealthy parents who&apos;ve made <em>him</em> independently wealthy.  <em>Don&apos;t you just hate this guy?</em></p>

<p>NY gallery owner Jonathan Levine isn&apos;t a fan; he says his work is &quot;all completely derivative of Shepard [Fairey] and Banksy.&quot; But if he&apos;s really just a rich schlock artist copping on already successful street artists&apos; styles, why are his main &quot;muses,&quot; Banksy and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522051124/http://gothamist.com/tags/shepardfairey">Fairey</a>, helping to put him in the spotlight? The WSJ says Fairey &quot;has mixed feelings about Mr. Brainwash&apos;s artwork but calls Mr. Brainwash a friend. &apos;Mystery is always interesting,&apos; he says of the artist. &apos;But he is 100% sincere.&apos;&quot; So maybe this Frenchman is just a vessel for a collaborative work of art between Shepard and Fairey? Someone, quick, fetch us our decoder ring!</p>
