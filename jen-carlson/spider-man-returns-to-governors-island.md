Even the old Burger King on the southern end of the Island makes an appearance in the story.&quot; Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131218/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2004/07/01/the_lost_burger_king_of_governors_island.php">there was a Burger King on Governors Island</a>! If you want to ask Van Lente some Spidey questions, or maybe about how he researched all these spots, drop by the Commanding Officers House on Sunday.</p>
