<p>It may be a confusing hybrid of winter and spring outside, but the summer concert lineups are starting to filter in slowly, like a sticky summer breeze. The Open Space Alliance has announced their first show at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105150/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/welcome_to_williamsburg_park.php">Williamsburg Park</a>, the recently rebranded outdoor space on the waterfront that used to be home to the post-McCarren <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105150/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/pool_parties_1.php#photo-1">Pool Parties</a>. And the first band that will play there this season is (drumroll): 2004&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105150/https://www.facebook.com/events/354359481336496/">The Shins</a>!  </p>

<p>Man Man will open the show, which will take place on May 26th (tickets will go on sale this Friday at noon). The concert will kick off this year&apos;s series of concerts at the venue, which will include both free and ticketed lineups.</p>

<p>Along with James Mercer the band&#x2019;s current lineup features Richard Swift, Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer, Yuuki Matthews of Crystal Skulls and Mark Watrous. Which is a pretty different lineup from the one that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105150/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziwr4f5eR0M">changed your life</a>.</p>
