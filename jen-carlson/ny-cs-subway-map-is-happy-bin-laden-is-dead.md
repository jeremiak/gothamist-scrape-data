<p>Street artist Beast has reinterpreted the city&apos;s subway map, rotating it 90 degrees, and essentially making Manhattan look very... excited. And for good reason: Bin Laden is dead! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074205/http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/?p=21169">Brooklyn Street Art</a> notes that &quot;tourists gladly pointed to it&#x2019;s features while some quizzical old timers took a little while more to gander at it, wondering what seemed different about the new map.&quot; They also say that the posters are all down now, so, insert erectile dysfuntion joke here.</p>
