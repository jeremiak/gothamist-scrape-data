<p>Looks like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006033219/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/29/eternal_sunshine_house_evicts_squat.php">evicted squatters</a> of 59 Orient Avenue are trying to reclaim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006033219/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/20/eternal_nightmare.php">their abandoned home</a>. Caroline Stanley of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006033219/http://flavorwire.com/">Flavorwire</a>, a neighbor of the Williamsburg house, tells us: &quot;We heard people trying to get in last night around 12 and called the cops. The fence has been like that for two days now and when I called 311 to report it to the DOB they claimed that two other complaints had already been lodged.&quot; The house, of course, is famous for being Clementine&apos;s home in <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, and the street made more famous by its real-life resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006033219/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/14/gondry.php">Michel Gondry</a>. </p>

More photos of its present state after the jump.</p>
