title: Video: NBC Rejects PETA's Superbowl Ad
---

<p>Of all the ads to be blocked from running during the Superbowl, who would have thought it would be PETA&apos;s? The organization submitted the below commercial, &quot;which features a bevy of beauties who are powerless to resist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102025349/http://www.peta.org/content/standalone/VeggieLove/Default.aspx?c=pbsaec09">the temptation of veggie love</a>&quot;&#x2014;but NBC came up with a laundry list of edits that would need to be made before they considered airing it. Some of their cuts included: &quot;touching her breast with her hand while eating broccoli, rubbing pelvic region with pumpkin, asparagus on her lap appearing as if it is ready to be inserted into vagina&quot;...PETA is making us redder than a rare steak! Here&apos;s the commercial that was deeemed too hot for TV:</p>

<p>NBC&apos;s full rejection letter can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102025349/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/01/veggie_love.php">through PETA&apos;s site</a>. Wonder if they would have approved <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102025349/http://www.meat.org/">this ad</a></em> for their wing-lovin&apos; fans. Recently PETA sexed up their anti-carriage horse ads with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111102025349/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/20/petas_anticarriage_horse_campaign.php">a naked Kristen Johnston</a>.</p>
