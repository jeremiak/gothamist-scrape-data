										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="phpkVHJS0AM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152305im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpkVHJS0AM.jpg" width="300" height="253"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Hal, the Central Park coyote of 2006</span></i></div> It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152305/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/22/meep_meep_coyot.php">a few years</a> since we last heard of a coyote on the loose in Central Park, though recently there was one spotted and captured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152305/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/coyote_caught_in_harlem.php">in Harlem</a>. But those carefree Coyote-less days are over&#x2014;a reader just sent us an email, warning: &quot;There&apos;s another coyote on the loose in Central Park. I walk my dog there at least twice every day and had heard from other dog owners that police were warning people to keep their dogs on leash at night because of a coyote. Well last night around 6:45pm I saw him with my own eyes&#x2014;just inside the entrance at 7th Avenue and Central Park South. He came toward me from the east and stood on a big boulder gazing at my dog.&quot; The suspense! <p></p>

<p>After a 5-minute staredown, during which time 311 was called, the coyote walked away... but it&apos;s still on the loose. And with all those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152305/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/30/will_the_rabid_racoons_come_for_you.php">rabid raccoons</a> in the area, are we going to be encountering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152305/http://gothamist.com/tags/coyote">coyotes</a> foaming at the mouth soon? We&apos;ve contacted the Central Park Conservancy and the Parks Department and will update with any statements when they get back to us.</p>

<p>As for the last Central Park coyote, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152305/http://pruned.blogspot.com/2006/03/into-wild.html">named Hal</a>&#x2014;he ended dying up after his capture from a lethal combo of suffering stress in captivity and ingesting rodent poison.</p>
