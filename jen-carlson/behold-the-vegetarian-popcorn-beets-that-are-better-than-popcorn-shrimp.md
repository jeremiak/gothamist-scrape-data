<p>Earlier this week Amanda Cohen of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918111631/http://gothamist.com/tags/dirtcandy">Dirt Candy</a> debuted her latest creation: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918111631/https://www.instagram.com/p/BIGie9SjpFf/?taken-by=dirtcandynyc&amp;hl=en">Popcorn Beets with Thai Green Curry Ranch Dressing</a>. Cohen often creates painstakingly complex dishes for her vegetarian clientele, the likes of which we&apos;ve never seen recreated in NYC despite the growing meatless menus around town. So when she introduces a new dish, you know it&apos;s going to be unique and that she&apos;s spent days in the kitchen perfecting it from the first ingredient to the plating. </p>

<p>A riff on popcorn shrimp (vegetarians really do enjoy creating mock versions of meat dishes), this one is not only pretty, but it packs a lot of flavor into a small bowl. Bonus: there&apos;s even a little bit of bourbon in the buttermilk. </p>

<p>&quot;What makes popcorn shrimp is really the cornmeal batter on the outside,&quot; Cohen told us when we dropped by this week, &quot;so we&apos;ve done the same thing with beets. They&apos;re a little bit sweet so we wanted to add a really, really savory sauce to them.&quot; They&apos;re also roasted in salt before being battered and fried, and the end result creates a &quot;flavor explosion,&quot; Cohen calls it, with layers of sweet and savory and flavors hitting each taste bud. </p>

<p>Popcorn Beets are now on the menu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918111631/http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/">at Dirt Candy</a> for $9 (gratuity included) and they will be there for &quot;at least the next 3 months.&quot; Here&apos;s how they&apos;re made:</p>
