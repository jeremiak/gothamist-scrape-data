<span class="photo_caption">OMG didn&apos;t exist yet, so Ryan&apos;s character typed out: Omigod.</span></p>

<p>A tipster tells us that he &quot;just ran across the original, official <em>You&apos;ve Got Mail</em> website&quot; (how does this happen?), and it&apos;s still functional, offering up a time capsule into website design circa 1998. We just spent ten minutes going down the rabbit hole, a journey that begins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331224357/http://youvegotmail.warnerbros.com/">here</a>. For the full experience, you are going to want to click on the &quot;here&quot; where it reads: &quot;if you have Flash click the logo or here to enter the site.&quot; Definitely do not skip the intro, it really sets the tone.</p>

<p>Once you get inside, you&apos;re on your own. There are a lot of things to click on, one of which allows you to tour the Upper West Side&#x2014;the site copy reads:<br>
</p><blockquote><br>
&quot;There&apos;s something about the Upper West Side that makes it such a special place in the hearts of many, that gives it a character so unique. It&apos;s a part of New York with a quality so its own that it too plays a starring role in You&apos;ve Got Mail alongside Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan&#x2014;appearing as itself, of course.<p></p>

<p>Now you can take a quick tour of some of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331224357/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/20/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_meg_ryan_hits_rea.php#photo-2">the Upper West Side</a> sites featured in <em>You&apos;ve Got Mail</em>. Visit the caf&#xE9; where Meg Ryan meets Tom Hanks! See where they eat hot dogs! Learn about the 79th st. Boat Basin, Zabar&apos;s, and more.</p>

<p>And while you&apos;re learning about the Upper West Side, what better auditory accompaniment than that available from our Sounds of New York section? No matter where in the world you may be, you&apos;ll be able to hear cars honking and get a fine headache.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There&apos;s also some audio where Nora Ephron talks about the Upper West Side and draws &quot;some interesting parallels between New York City and the internet.&quot; We&apos;d love to hear that, but we don&apos;t have RealPlayer.</p>
