										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpQHhvW4AM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194354im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpQHhvW4AM.jpg" width="211" height="226" class="image-left"> </span>Foie gras, the fatty liver (aka <em>diseased organ</em>) of male ducks and geese, is back in the spotlight with another protest scheduled to take place this Saturday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194354/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thomas-keller-targeted-for-animal-cruelty-92954079.html">targeting Thomas Keller</a> of Per Se. </p>

<p>Last time around, the Animal Protection &amp; Rescue League (organized by New School student Michelle Brotman) protested Bill Telepan, who has won a merit badge from Animal Welfare Approved and carefully sources his foie gras to avoid supporting factory farms. Their target this time around isn&apos;t that much different, as Keller also chooses to get his goods from more humane sources. But... is there <em>really</em> a humane way to disease a duck&apos;s organ? To catch up on the process, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194354/http://www.goveg.com/feat/foie/">here&apos;s James Bond</a> discussing the evils of the industry.</p>

<p>The group claims they&apos;ll be displaying graphic banners showing scenes from inside Keller&apos;s supplier, Hudson Valley Foie Gras. A board chair of APRL says, &quot;The conditions I have witnessed in Hudson Valley Foie Gras are appalling. In visiting there and other farms to document conditions, I saw ducks panting incessantly and showing great difficulty walking and breathing in the later stages of force feeding, and I saw trash barrels full of dead ducks killed by the process.&quot; </p>

<p>Still salivating for Per Se&apos;s extravagant dish? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194354/http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/31268/">NYMag</a>, the foie gras on the restaurant&apos;s tasting menu is the single most caloric menu item, weighing in at 435.4 calories (almost as much as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160103194354/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/12/kfc_double_down_hype_meets_reality.php">Double Down</a>).</p>
