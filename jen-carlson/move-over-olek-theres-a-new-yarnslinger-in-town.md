</div></div>					<p>Enough of that showy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163710/http://gothamist.com/tags/olek">Olek-esque</a> yarn bombing, the genre has shifted and it&apos;s all about minimalism. The Minneapolis-based street artist Hot Tea (aka Hottea, aka Eric Rieger) recently came over to Olek-territory&#x2014;skeins drawn!&#x2014;to lay down some of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163710/http://www.font-love.com/2011/06/eric-rieger-is-hottea-typographic-yarn-bomber.html">critically-acclaimed</a>, unique 3-D style designs. He&apos;s been yarn-bombing chain link fences on the Lower East Side, and Gothamist publisher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163710/http://www.twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a> documented the finished products (click through for a look).</p>

<p>In the below video, Hot Tea explains, &quot;I gravitate towards old things... vacant spaces... giving them new life.&quot; Though there&apos;s definitely plenty of canvas for him in Manhattan, it&apos;s unclear at this point if he&apos;ll be putting anything more up.</p>
