										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:225px; "> <img alt="michelleelmo0509.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005135101im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/michelleelmo0509.jpg" width="225" height="299"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo by Sesame Workshop/Richard Termine</span></i></div> Michelle Obama has experienced a lot of exciting, historic stuff this year, but yesterday she visited Sesame Street and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005135101/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/politics/ny-michellesesame0506,0,5389264.story">Newsday</a> declared it to be the most exciting thing to happen since her time as First Lady. <p></p>

<p>After her visit yesterday (and before her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005135101/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/06/time_100_gala_from_michelle_obama_t.php">Time 100</a> appearance) she was at the United Nations thanking the diplomats and staff for support they&apos;ve shown the President, but the excited of her morning got the best of her and she told them, &quot;I&apos;m thrilled to be here, but I was just at Sesame Street&#x2014;I&apos;m sorry. And <strong>I never thought I&apos;d be on Sesame Street with Elmo and Big Bird and I was thrilled.</strong> I&apos;m still thrilled. I&apos;m on a high.<strong> I think it&apos;s probably the best thing I&apos;ve done so far in the White House.</strong>&quot; (We agree that it is an awfully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005135101/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/visiting_sesame_street.php">exciting place to visit</a>!)</p>

Mrs. Obama and her pal Elmo talked about eating right, exercising regularly and being a healthy and positive role model for children.&quot; The segment will likely air during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005135101/http://www.muppetnewsflash.com/2009/03/more-stars-visit-sesame-street-for.html">40th season</a>, sometime later this year.</p>
