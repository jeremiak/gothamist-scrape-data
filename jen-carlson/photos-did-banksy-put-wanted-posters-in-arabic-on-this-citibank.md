This morning a tipster sent in photos of these &quot;WANTED&quot; plaques (with Disney&apos;s Jafar) stuck to the side of the building, with Arabic sprayed on to them. Rayne Holm, who studies Arabic at NYU, tells us: &quot;It says Jafar phonetically, with an Arabic intonation (J-aye-fr),&quot; and the signature (which is highly stylized Arabic and more difficult to deciper) says &quot;Banksee.&quot; Another Arabic reader tells us, &quot;It&apos;s hard to say since it&apos;s pretty calligraphic, but the lower-right hand corner looks like Banksy.&quot;</p>

<p>But is it? Some believe it could be a collaboration (like the one he may have just done <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142752/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/photo_did_banksy_and_graffiti_legen.php">with Cope2</a>), while our in-house expert Jake Dobkin says, &quot;It has no relation to the wall that it&apos;s on, it&apos;s a square paper work with no cuts, and the stenciling is crude. The only thing that resembles Banksy is the red text, and as far as I know he doesn&apos;t use Arabic in his work.&quot; Even if they aren&apos;t the real thing, they&apos;ve likely already been ripped off the wall.</p>

<p>The street artist hasn&apos;t updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142752/http://banksy.co.uk/">his website</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142752/http://instagram.com/BANKSYNY">Instagram</a> yet today, so it&apos;s unclear if this is officially his 18th piece of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142752/http://gothamist.com/tags/betterouthanin">Better Out Than In</a> residency.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nic Garcia is at the CitiBank and says as of  11:15 a.m. all of the posters have been removed, &quot;each was affixed with a single piece of padded double stick tape.&quot; Double stick tape doesn&apos;t really seems like Banksy&apos;s style...</p>
