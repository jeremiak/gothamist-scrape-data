Instead, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150053/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/10/103_days_til_th.php">Rufus Wainwright</a> tried to recreate the blackout with a 12-hour &quot;Blackout Sabbath&quot; on March 19th&#x2014;if you don&apos;t remember it, then it probably didn&apos;t go as planned.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150053/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nylite0328,0,3143538.story">This year</a>, things are gonna change as New York City landmarks, including Times Square billboards, the Chrysler and Empire State buildings and the lights on the East River bridges will go dark for an hour. The fun begins tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m., and the effort is spearheaded by local Edward Norton&#x2014;the official ambassador for Earth Hour <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150053/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/27/landmarks_go_dark_saturday_for_eart.php">for the WWF</a>. </p>

<p>The organization says the lightless hour is &quot;to make a statement on the need for effective action on climate change.&quot;  Outside of our city limits, &quot;hundreds of millions of people from more than 2000 towns and cities in 84 countries are currently expected to take part in the event.&quot; Will you be heading to Times Square to bask in the darkness?</p>
