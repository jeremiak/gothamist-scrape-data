<p>During his State of the City address last night, Mayor de Blasio unveiled his vision for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509035810/http://gothamist.com/tags/governorsisland">Governors Island</a>, which he aims to transform into an &quot;innovation cluster.&quot; His plan, in theory, would bring the revitalized historic district even further into the 21st century, while helping to &quot;position New York City as global leader in the new economy.&quot; He called this the &quot;next chapter&quot; for the island. From the Mayor&apos;s Office:</p>

<blockquote>Governors Island will be the site of a sweeping economic development project poised to turn the area into a center of culture, commerce and innovation. Building on the success of Cornell-Tech, and advancing the City&#x2019;s efforts to redevelop our waterfront, the City will work with the Trust for Governors Island to issue an RFP for a comprehensive plan to develop up to 33 acres on two development zones situated on the southern end of the Island, and reactivate the 900,000 square feet of existing space in the Historic District on the northern end of the Island.
 
The Island will boast unparalleled open spaces, a reanimated historic district and a 21st century &#x2018;Innovation Cluster&#x2019; that will bring together innovators, entrepreneurs and educators to generate new ideas, economic activity and jobs.</blockquote>

 <br>
What&apos;s next? &quot;Following public engagement, the Trust for Governors Island (TGI) will release a RFEI this summer. By the end of 2016, TGI plans to release a RFP seeking formal proposals for activation of the vacant space and historic district on Governors Island. After one or more proposals are selected and environmental review and ULURP are complete, construction could begin on the first phase of a development as early as 2019.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Governors Island&apos;s history is mostly militaristic&#x2014;it was first used as a base in 1633. At that time the island was smaller&#x2014;it wasn&apos;t until the early 1900s that the final 103 acres of land was added under the supervision of the Army Corps of Engineers, who used material excavated from the first New York City subway line to fill out the island.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the island began serving as a United States Coast Guard base, and for decades families lived there. There was even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509035810/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/abandoned_governors_island_1.php#photo-1">a Burger King</a>, a bowling alley, and a movie theater.</p>

<p>For the past few years the Island has grown as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509035810/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/photos_jazz_age_lawn_party.php">a summer destination</a>, open to the public from May to October. There are currently two year-round tenants: Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, a public high school that serves 430 students; and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council&#x2019;s Arts Center, an artist studio residency program. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509035810/https://govisland.com/">Governors Island</a> will reopen at the end of May this year with a new feature: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509035810/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/governors_island_hills.php#photo-1">rolling hills</a>.</p>
