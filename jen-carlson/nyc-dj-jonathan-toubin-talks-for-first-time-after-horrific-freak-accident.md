Toubin was asleep in his hotel room when a cab crashed through the wall and pinned him beneath the vehicle. He was in critical condition at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital in Portland&#x2014;with fractures in his skull base, pelvis, collarbones, ribs, sternum, and many internal injuries including a punctured liver and crushed lungs; since the accident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231923/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/11/giant_benefit_party_for_horrificall.php">benefits have been thrown</a> for him. Now the New York Night Train DJ has spoken for the first time, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231923/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jonathan-toubin-talks-for-the-first-time-about-his-freak-accident-20120129">Rolling Stone</a>.<p></p>

<blockquote><strong>So the night before the accident, you stayed in and went to bed. What happened next?</strong> I woke up a month later. There were some friends and family there, and I didn&#x2019;t know what happened. I didn&#x2019;t even know what year if was. Everyone had to explain it to me, and it was kind of unbelievable. I was really horrified at first&#x2014;the thing is that when they woke me up, they weren&#x2019;t sure how long I was gonna be there and didn&#x2019;t know how normal I was gonna be. Turns out things are gonna be a lot better than they thought, so that&#x2019;s good. But the first thing that happened when I woke up in the hospital was like, I gotta get out of this place. They showed me some of the news articles and, wow. Some were depressing, but there have been a couple about what people have been doing for me, which really, I&#x2019;m just bowled over that anyone went to any trouble.</blockquote>
