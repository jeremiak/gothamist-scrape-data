The band practiced and practiced for years, often getting serious screen time on the popular sitcom <em>Full House</em>, but nothing much ever came of them in the end. Until NOW. Uncle Jesse, who now goes exclusively by John Stamos, has gotten the fictional band back together for a big reunion on <em>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</em>, and it&apos;s happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150319001637/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20717796,00.html">this Friday</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150319001637/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLqAqIj8Rdc">Have mercy</a>, etc.</p>

Stay tuned for deets.&quot; But will we get a Beach Boys be a part of all this?</p>
