</div></div>					<p>Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141717/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/17/statue.php">in 2009</a> we revisited the construction of the Statue of Liberty, and with Lady Liberty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141717/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/statue_of_liberty_celebrates_125th.php">turning 125 today</a>, we thought it was time to take another look back at her younger years. As we noted in 2009, the photos invoke apocalyptic feelings thanks to movies like <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (in other words, they&apos;re pretty awesome). But after all this time, she&apos;s still got her head on her shoulders, and doesn&apos;t look like she&apos;s aged a day.</p>
