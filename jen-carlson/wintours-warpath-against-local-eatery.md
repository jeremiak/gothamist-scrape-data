Yep, NIMBYs: so hot right now. </p>

<p>Nightlife <em>somebody</em> Serge Becker is planning on opening the eatery, called Miss Lily, but Wintour is raising concerns amongst other area residents&#x2014;mainly about the establishment generating unwanted noise and traffic, as well as attracting a dangerous element. When Wintour asked for a count at a meeting last night, 97 of 100 residents on Community Board 2&apos;s committee declared they&apos;d vote against the project, which would be located between West Houston and Sullivan Streets. They will reportedly issue a recommendation on Miss Lily soon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the folks behind Miss Lily claim they are a restuarant, and not a nightclub, but Wintour&apos;s 24-year-old son declared at the meeting: &quot;I don&apos;t care if you call it a restaurant. No restaurant stays open until 2 a.m.&quot; We&apos;re beginning to think Chlo&#xEB; Sevigny getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163516/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/could_chloe_sevigny_get_on_her_comm.php">on a Community Board</a> might just be a good thing for this city.</p>
