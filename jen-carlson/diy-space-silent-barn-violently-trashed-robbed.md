The venue has spent seven years accumulating equipment, tools, and artwork to create a DIY space in the community, but over the weekend they were robbed. They say $15,000 worth of audio equipment is gone, along with personal belongings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305055014/https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-silent-barn/we-got-robbed/222468884456039">adding</a>: <p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;The violence to the space is almost as upsetting as the theft.  Doors were ripped off of hinges, furniture ripped to shreds, and everything in the space strewn about in a sea of debris... we&#x2019;re still reeling with what this means for our own lives and the future of the space.  If you would like to find out what you can do, email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305055014/mailto:silentbarn@gmail.com">silentbarn@gmail.com</a>.  We need your help to continue.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the space&apos;s owners to find out the status of things, and to get more details on the robbery&#x2014;it&apos;s unclear if the space is actually legal, so it&apos;s possible the police weren&apos;t notified. We&apos;ll update when we hear back.</p>
