<p>The West Village artist behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153909/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/guerilla_subway_etiquette_posters_d.php">subway etiquette signs</a>, Jason Shelowitz (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153909/http://www.jayshells.com/">jayshells</a>), is being embraced by the masses for his good deed/public art project. He&apos;s created around 400 of the posters, all calling out straphanger&apos;s on their unsavory underground habits. So far only 50 are up, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153909/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_slob_slap_jqLqDsY4ETz5PnAa4MwqjM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> notes that he used double-sided tape that won&apos;t leave a mess once the sign is removed (he is the etiquette artist after all!). </p>

<p>While there&apos;s a $25 fine for illegally placing posters in the subway system, so far he hasn&apos;t had any problems&#x2014;and in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153909/http://www.wpix.com/videobeta/5356f059-d53e-4054-8b5a-c45645ad5cc0/News/Subway-Nuisance-Signs">the below interview</a> he says he even witnessed some transit employees reading the signs and laughing. It&apos;s really kind of shocking no one has done this before&#x2014;considering there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153909/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/train_pigs.php">are plenty</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153909/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/subway_douchery_brings_up_undergrou.php">online outlets</a> calling out commuters on their bad habits.</p>
