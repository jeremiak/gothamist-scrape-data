<p>How far would you go for your unironic love of a band? 12,082 miles? That&apos;s the distance Michael Feld was willing to travel on his Huey Lewis &amp; The News journey. Feld says last summer he &quot;started thinking how great it would be to visit all the cities listed in &apos;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll,&apos;&quot; asking, &quot;Why those places? What connected them to Huey Lewis? What rock &amp; roll magic could be found in those disparate places?&quot; </p>

<p>Feld traveled to New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., San Antonio, Philadelphia (&quot;Liberty Town&quot;), Boston, Baton Rouge, Tulsa, Austin, Oklahoma City, Seattle, San Francisco, Cleveland, and Detroit. This morning he told us about a New York moment you&apos;ll see in the video:</p>

<blockquote>There&apos;s an Evangelical women who had her &quot;repent for your sins&quot; sign up in NYC that&apos;s in the video once or twice. While our views on the world are extremely different, making her laugh by dancing around and singing really showed me that there are little crazy things that can bring extreme opposites together. Even when I watch the video for the 800th time she makes me smile.</blockquote>

<p>His vision quest took him on 11 planes, 4 trains, and in 5 rental cars, all to &quot;not only as a tribute to Huey Lewis but to prove that the heart of rock &amp; roll is indeed still alive and beating.&quot; He told us he &quot;learned that while the musical landscape is ever-changing and evolving, there&apos;s really something about Huey Lewis and his music that made everyone smile when I told them what I was doing.&quot; It&apos;s rather impossible to hate on this:<br>
