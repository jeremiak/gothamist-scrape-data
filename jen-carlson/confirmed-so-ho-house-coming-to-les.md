<p>The private, members-only SoHo House currently only has one New York City home, which is in the Meatpacking District. But that&apos;s all about to change. As we exclusively reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408234014/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/17/is_the_soho_house_opening_on_the_lo.php">last month</a>, the club had been eyeing the building at 139-141 Ludlow Street, and now the Community Board 3 agenda for March shows them pitching for a liquor license. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408234014/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2013/02/its-confirmed-soho-house-coming-to-139-141-ludlow-street.html">the LoDown</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The just-released Community Board 3 agenda for March shows Soho House making a pitch for a liquor license when the &#x201C;State Liquor Authority&#x201D; committee convenes March 11.  In recent weeks, club representatives have been making the rounds throughout the LES, putting the word out that they want to be a good neighbor.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This Lower East Side, and specifically Ludlow Street, has seen a lot of changes recently&#x2014;with many beloved mainstays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408234014/http://gothamist.com/tags/riples">being forced out</a>. Is anyone else worried that the Lower East Side is going to make the SoHo House more intolerable, rather than vice versa?</p>
