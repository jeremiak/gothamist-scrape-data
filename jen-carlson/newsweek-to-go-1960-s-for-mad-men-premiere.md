										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="newsweeksixties0112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150029im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/newsweeksixties0112.jpeg" width="350" height="413" class="image-right"> </span>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150029/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> returns on March 25th, Newsweek will be going back in time to the 1960s. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150029/http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/newsweek-reviving-1960s-design-mad-men-issue/232075/">AdAge</a>, the magazine will (hopefully) even be running the same ads... except for tobacco ads, which the magazine no longer accepts.</p>

<p>Editor Tina Brown says she came up with the idea with showrunner Matthew Weiner, noting, &quot;Newsweek was very much on the cultural forefront at the time of the show. It covered the events that are so much of the background for the show&apos;s drama&#x2014;the burgeoning civil rights movement, the women&apos;s rights movement, the Vietnam War. So it seemed like a wonderful marriage in a sense to take that and apply it to the magazine, to make the magazine an homage to the period.&quot; </p>

<p>However, back then Brown would have never been able to become editor, as she explains, during that time women were typically doing research for the &quot;swaggering male writers.&quot;</p>

<p>The <em>Mad Men</em> issue will be dated March 19th, and it will include a cover story on the series and a feature on the role of advertising in U.S. culture. But we sort of wish AMC would put that ad budget towards some vintage subways&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150029/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/boardwalk_empire_is_bringing_back_o.php">those are fun</a>.</p>
