<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212244/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/11/gothamist_house_relocates_to_variou.php">previously mentioned</a>, we&apos;re taking our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212244/http://gothamist.com/tags/LiveatGothamistHouse">Gothamist House</a> series on the road, or rather, into some of our favorite New York City locations. First stop: the New York Public Library&apos;s Schwarzman Building on 5th Avenue (once home to the old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212244/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/04/flashback_croton_reservoir.php">Croton Reservoir</a>). We brought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212244/http://myspace.com/thewalkmen">The Walkmen</a> over there earlier this month to film them performing a couple of songs in the midst of the marbled halls of the iconic building. Special thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212244/http://www.nypl.org/">the NYPL</a> for hosting us, and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212244/http://www.foglightfilms.com/">Foglight Films</a> for working all sorts of magic. Enjoy!</p>
