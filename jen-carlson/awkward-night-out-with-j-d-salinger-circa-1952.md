Salinger, stories about encounters with the author began to surface, putting him back in the public eye he had tried to escape. Notoriously reclusive, these stories of Salinger earlier in life&#x2014;attending parties, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520190918/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/14/salingers_former_date_kisses_tells.php">going on dates</a>&#x2014;<em>are</em> intriguing, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520190918/http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/02/07/an-evening-with-j-d-salinger/">The Paris Review</a> has just published the latest.</p>

<p>The story takes place in New York City, during the winter of 1952. The man telling it, Blair Fuller, attended a cocktail party at his parents&apos; house on 38th Street. Salinger was there, made some moves on Fuller&apos;s younger (married) sister, and eventually took her, her husband, and Fuller back to his own place&#x2014;a brownstone further uptown&#x2014;for more drinks in a more private setting.</p>

<p>Upon his guests somewhat abrupt departure later that night, however, Salinger allegedly chased their cab down the street, yelling: &#x201C;No, no. Please don&#x2019;t go. Please stay and have another drink. Don&#x2019;t go now. Stop. Please come back!&#x201D; Could this have been the beginning of his life as a recluse? After all, there is no rejection when you <em>don&apos;t let anyone in</em>. Way to go, Fuller.</p>
