<p>Have you heard of Albert Fish? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092502/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/notorious-1920s-killer-the-brooklyn-vampire/">Ephemeral NY</a> takes a look back at the demented serial killer, who came to New York City in 1890. He may have been a male prostitute for some time, and had a sick fixation with children and cannibalism. In 1928 Fish responded to an ad in the classifieds by an 18-year-old boy named Edward Budd. When he visited the family&apos;s home&#x2014;at 406 West 15th Street&#x2014;with the promise of a job for the boy, he caught a glimpse of 10-year-old Grace Budd. </p>

<p>Once he earned the trust of the Budd family, he asked to bring Grace to his niece&apos;s party&#x2014;and her parents agreed to let her go. He took her to a house in Westchester, strangled her, and cut her up into pieces&#x2014;eating her over the course of nine days. In 1933 he was found by police in a boarding house on East 52nd Street and arrested, after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092502/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fish#The_letter">grisly letter</a> describing Grace&apos;s death was sent to the Budd family. In it, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I made up my mind to eat her. I took her to an empty house... she picked wildflowers... I stripped all my clothes off. When she saw me naked she began to cry, I grabbed her, I stripped her naked... how she did kick, bite and scratch. I choked her to death, then cut her into small pieces so I could take my meat into my room, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me nine days to eat her entire body.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Fish was executed at Sing Sing in March 1936, and allegedly looked forward to the &#x201C;supreme thrill&#x201D; of the electric chair.
