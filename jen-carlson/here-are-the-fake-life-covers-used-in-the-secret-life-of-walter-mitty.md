                            <p>The (most) recent adaptation of <em>Walter Mitty</em>, starring Ben Stiller as a magazine photo editor, featured a number of iconic-looking LIFE magazine covers... but almost none of them were real, which seems fitting. They did all feature some stunning images from the magazine&apos;s expansive archives. You can click through for a look at some of the false covers used in the movie, often prominently displayed in the background. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194848/http://life.time.com/culture/walter-mitty-life-magazine-covers/#1">LIFE.com</a> offers a little bit of insight into the covers:</p><blockquote>&quot;In this rendition of the tale, Stiller plays a photo editor at LIFE magazine&#x2014;still publishing, thanks to the magic of the movies, four decades after it shuttered in 1972&#x2014; and much of the film is set in the meticulously recreated offices of the storied weekly. In those offices, meanwhile, hang poster-sized versions of LIFE magazine covers through the years. The covers are stirring, iconic&#x2014;and, for the most part, they&#x2019;re fake.&quot;</blockquote> The photos, however, are real LIFE images. Jeff Mann, the production designer on the film, and Stiller himself &quot;felt that the photos they chose to use as covers, from the literally millions of pictures in LIFE&#x2019;s archive, had to somehow &apos;convey the influence of LIFE magazine, while at the same time helping to move our story along. It was a fabulous problem, and one we had a lot of fun working to solve.&apos;&#x201D;<p></p>
