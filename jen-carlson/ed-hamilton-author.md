More recently, he put out a book of tales from his hotel home -- an establishment that provides endless material. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221122939/http://www.perseusbookspromos.com/buy.php?ISBN=1568583796">Legends of the Chelsea Hotel</a> is part satirical and part historical, and Hamilton will be around town reading from it this month. Catch him on November 8th at 192 Books, and on November 12th at The Half King.</em> </p>

<p><strong>What came first, the idea for the blog, or the book?</strong><br>
The blog, which was my girlfriend Debbie Martin&#x2019;s idea.  The Chelsea seemed way too anarchic to describe in a straightforward, linear way.  There were always a thousand things coming at us all at once: if you sit in the lobby for an hour you will be witness to any number of strange incidents and intrigues, good, bad and indifferent.  The more open-ended blog form, on the other hand, seemed tailor made for the job, since from day to day we could just write about whatever struck our fancy.  But I love books, and with everything I write, the idea of somehow transforming it into a book is never far from my mind.  About half the content of Legends of the Chelsea Hotel appeared originally as blog posts, while the rest is new. </p>

<p><strong>When did you start the blog?</strong><br>
April, 2005.  We saw the changes coming in the hotel and the neighborhood, and we thought, hey, someone has got to do something to chronicle this bubbling caldron of inspired madness&#x2014;all these wacky people and their comic and tragic stories--before it passes away.  I didn&#x2019;t want to do it, because it seemed like too much work&#x2014;which is one reason nobody had done it before&#x2014;and besides that I was working on a novel, but luckily Debbie convinced me.  That was two and a half years ago and I&#x2019;ve only recently been able to get back to the novel.  </p>

<p><strong>What did you hope to let the world in on through the blog, and has that changed?</strong><br>
I wanted to give people a look beneath the surface of the coolest building on earth, an insider&#x2019;s perspective into the lives and struggles of the working artists, outlaws, con-men and the insane who populate this divine maelstrom of creativity.</p>

<p>And yeah, my aims have changed.  It&#x2019;s become increasingly difficult to focus on day-to-day lives, artist&#x2019;s exhibits, things like that.  Now I want people to see how the greed of corporate developers has ruined a beautiful (and successful) experiment in living.  It&#x2019;s now become almost impossible for young or struggling artists to move to New York and dedicate themselves to the creative life.  The Chelsea was one of the last places where they could do this. </p>

<p><strong>With the blog, and now with the book out, have you felt any direct pressure from the new management for your outspokenness?</strong><br>
Actually, outside of occasionally glaring at me as I go through the lobby, surprisingly little.  They seem to have decided to ignore me as they go about slowly yet surely dismantling the Chelsea Hotel community.  Others have not been so lucky, as BD Hotels has been jacking up the rent on everyone they think they can get away with forcing out&#x2014;either because these tenants owe money, or because their apartments are subject to luxury decontrol, or for other, less defensible reasons.  </p>
