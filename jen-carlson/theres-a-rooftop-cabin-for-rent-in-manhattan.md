</div></div>					<p>How many rooftop cabins <em>are</em> there hiding above in NYC? Last year we looked at what is hands down the most bucolic one we&apos;ve seen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223184945/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/17/nyc_roof_cabin_with_yard.php">on Greenwich Street</a>, and now another has popped up. This time, on the rental market&#x2014;the cabin on top of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223184945/http://kwnyc.com//index.cfm?page=details&amp;id=162372">15 West 28th Street</a> building can be yours for $4,200/month. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223184945/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/12/21/14038734/nomad-nyc-rooftop-cabin-for-rent">to Curbed</a>, inside you&apos;ll find a &quot;spacious studio layout with a sleeping alcove, an updated kitchen, petite bathroom, and glorious skylights.&quot; The unique part of the home isn&apos;t inside, however, it&apos;s the outdoor area, which in its current state needs a little bit of greenery and fixing up. Out there you&apos;ll find plenty of blank canvas rooftop space, and more importantly: a porch. Just like we&apos;ve heard they have out in the countryside. </p>
