<p>Here in America, we love to celebrate fried food (hello, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002133304/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/11/vegan_fried_kool-aid_comes_to_the_e.php">vegan deep fried Kool-Aid balls</a>)&#x2014;first we eat it, then we Hallmark it with a fake holiday. And today, fellow Americans, is National French Fries Day. What&apos;s your poison: Curly, crinkle cut, waffled, steak/wedge, cheese, disco, shoestring? We took a quick scientific poll around Gothamist HQ, and here are our top picks of where you should pick up fries around the city:<br>
</p><ul><li><strong>Rippers</strong> (the Meat Hook&apos;s stand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002133304/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/your_guide_to_rockaway_beach_this_s.php">in Rockaway</a>): &quot;They&apos;re fucking outrageous&#x2014;they&apos;re coated in flour before frying so they&apos;re almost like tempura-fried fries, and you can get them doused in cheese sauce!&quot;<br>
</li><li><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002133304/http://www.pommesfrites.ws/">Pommes Frites</a></strong>: &quot;Yes, it is hyped. Yes, there is always a line. But damn are those double-fried french fries a tiny piece of heaven. All the frite sauces are good but I&apos;m partial to the wasabi, the Vietnamese pineapple and the sweet mango chutney.&quot;<br>
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002133304/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/a_look_inside_the_breslin_latest_fr.php#photo-1"><strong>The Breslin</strong></a>: The restaurant at the Ace Hotel serves up Thrice Cooked Chips. Extra crispy means extra good for you!<br>
</li><li><strong>Do Or Dine</strong>: The Bed-Stuy restaurant serves up some quirky items, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002133304/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/10/do_or_dine_does_their_doughnuts_wit.php">those foie gras doughnuts</a>, so their fries have to be special right? And they just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002133304/https://twitter.com/#!/Do_or_Dine/status/91185608516575232">Tweeted</a> that if you drop by tonight you&apos;ll get &quot;a free bowl of our twice-fried tubersticks!

<p>Personally, we prefer our fries sitting under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002133304/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php">a lobster roll</a>. How about you?</p>
