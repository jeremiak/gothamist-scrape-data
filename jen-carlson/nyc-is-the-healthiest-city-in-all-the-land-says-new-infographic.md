<p>If you mix the start-up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529111854/http://data.massivehealth.com/">Massive Health</a> in with some findings from their iPhone app the Eatery, you&apos;ll come out with a colorful infographic that declares New Yorkers to be the most healthy urban-dwellers in the United States. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529111854/http://www.psfk.com/2012/04/healthiest-cities.html">PSFK</a>, &quot;statistics were calculated from 7.68 million food ratings of half-a-million foods by Eatery users from over 50 countries over a span of 5 months.&quot; So... maybe New Yorkers <em>who use apps</em> are just particularly healthy. Anyway, shoot down a grain of salt and behold some of their findings:</p><ul><li>New York&apos;s health rating is 83.6% (in comparison to Philly&apos;s, which is under 30%)<br>
</li><li>New Yorkers eat oatmeal 2x more than other cities<br>
</li><li>We also consume more wheat, almonds, and arugula<br>
</li><li>However, on the less healthy side of things, we also consume 6.7x more coffee than other cities</li></ul><br>
But, how are people in Philly eating more bagels than us? The infographic also notes that Sunday is the unhealthiest of eating days, when those in their study were shown to eat 1.4x more croissants, and 1.5x more cupcakes.<p></p>

<p>And if you weren&apos;t already privy to the evils of the Caesar salad, you might want to dig into these stats&#x2014;at the very least, avoid Chili&apos;s (and Cheesecake Factory, if you find yourself on Long Island with a salad craving).</p>
