</div></div><p>On this day back in 1930 the Chrysler Building officially opened in New York City. It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130316004708/http://gothamist.com/2005/04/27/chrysler_building_turns_75_this_spring.php">five years</a> since we last took a look back at the building (then, on its 75th birthday), when the NY Times ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130316004708/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2005/04/22/opinion/20050423_opart.gif">this neat illustration</a> tracing the building&apos;s beginnings. The art deco building ties the New York Times building for the 3rd tallest in the city (they&apos;re both  1,047 feet), but when it first opened it enjoyed an 11th month run as the tallest, until the Empire State Building took that title. Some more fun facts:</p>

<ul><li>The building&apos;s groundbreaking was on September 19th, 1928, and opening ceremonies were on May 28th, 1930.
</li><li>The spire was delivered in four sections, and on October 23rd, 1929 the bottom section was hoisted onto the top of the building&apos;s dome and lowered into the 66th floor. The remaining sections were then brought up and riveted to the first one in sequential order. This took just 90 minutes!
</li><li>The corners of the 61st floor are adorned with eagles, replicas of the 1929 Chrysler hood ornaments; and on the 31st floor, the corner ornamentation are replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps.
</li><li>A private <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130316004708/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Club">Cloud Club</a> lounge and an observation area were once located at the top of the building; it occupied the 66th to 68th floors, but closed in the late 1970s. These days <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130316004708/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/garden/26cloud.html">you&apos;d never know</a> it was there.
</li><li>Ownership of the building changed hands a few times, starting when the Chrysler family sold it in 1947.
</li><li>The building was declared a landmark in 1976.
</li><li>The architect was Brooklynite and Pratt Institute grad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130316004708/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Van_Alen">Wiliam Van Alen</a>.
</li><li>Bonus: no one died during the construction of the building!</li></ul>
