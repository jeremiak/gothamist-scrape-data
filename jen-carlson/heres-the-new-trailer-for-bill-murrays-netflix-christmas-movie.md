<p>&quot;The entire city of New York is shut down,&quot; declares <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428153652/http://gothamist.com/tags/billmurray">Bill Murray</a> in his Netflix movie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428153652/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/14/bill_murray_bill_murray_bill_mu.php"><em>A Very Murray Christmas</em></a>. The first real look at the movie was just released, and shows Murray struggling to host his holiday special during a snowstorm that&apos;s paralyzed the city and shut down production. </p>

<p>The entire thing is set inside of the Carlyle Hotel, and features appearances from George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Michael Cera, and Miley Cyrus. It was written by Sofia Coppola, and Murray has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428153652/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/10/bill-murray-christmas-special">previously noted</a> that, &quot;It won&#x2019;t have a format, but it&#x2019;s going to have music. It will have texture. It will have threads through it that are writing. There will be prose.&quot;</p>
