title: Fort Greene Resident Leaves Hostile Note For Hollywood

                            <p>For whatever reason <em>some</em> New Yorkers absolutely hate it when Hollywood comes in to their neighborhood and turns their streets in to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075832/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/brooklyn_heights_residents_upset_th.php">some sort of magical wonderland</a>. These people probably have fancy automobiles they can&apos;t park when productions take over, and also they are probably no fun at all. And maybe <em>just because</em> they also hate the boost to the city&apos;s economy that filming on location delivers. The latest complaint comes out of Fort Greene, which is sort of surprising since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075832/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/brooklyn_heights_residents_upset_th.php">Brooklyn Heights</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075832/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/massive_movie_production_moves_into.php#photo-1">DUMBO</a> have really cornered this complaint market in the past. This letter was spotted this morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075832/https://twitter.com/thisisjendoll/status/378194131245228032">by Jen Doll</a>:</p>

<p>The note&#x2014;which reads: &quot;This our Neighborhood. We live here. We are real people. With real lives. Please finish your shoot and don&apos;t come back. You&apos;re not welcome here.&quot;&#x2014;is directed at <em>Brooklyn Taxi</em>. This is most likely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075832/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3027506/"><em>Taxi: Brooklyn South</em></a>, an upcoming TV series that&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075832/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/08/22/taxi-brooklyn-south-starring-greys-chyler-leigh-filming-in-nyc/">filming around town this summer</a>, and will feature a crime-solving team made up of an NYPD officer and a cab driver. That is <em>if</em> this eloquent letter doesn&apos;t stop production completely.</p>
