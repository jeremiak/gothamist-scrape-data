title: Kiefer Tackles Tree, Coming to NYC
---

	
										<p>Kiefer Sutherland has taken some time off from being Jack Bauer and has focused a bit on his independent record label act (yeah, we didn&apos;t know either),  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232458/http://www.roccodeluca.com/">Rocco DeLuca &amp; the Burden</a>. Despite the band name, the music actually isn&apos;t bad (take a listen at their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232458/http://myspace.com/roccodeluca">MySpace</a>). </p>

<p>Recently Sutherland went on an international tour with the boys, who are supporting their debut album, <em>I Trust You To Kill Me</em>. The tour was filmed, and has now become a rockumentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232458/http://itrustyoutokillmethemovie.com/">named after the album</a>. Below is a clip from the film. Whiskey + Christmas Trees + Kiefer Sutherland = awesome. </p>

</p><p>We hear the band will be coming through NYC soon and bringing this guy with them. In the meantime, check out the movie (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232458/http://movies.aol.com/movie/i-trust-you-to-kill-me/27211/main">now playing at Sunshine Cinema</a>). </p>
