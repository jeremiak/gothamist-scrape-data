<p>Years ago Courtney Love performed at the top of The Standard High Line <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101416/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/21/courtney_love_1.php">for New Year&apos;s Eve</a>, and since then the hotel has brought acts to the top floor to ring in every new year. And they have just informed us that this year&apos;s act is Icona Pop, who you know from that song you were listening to a lot earlier this year. You know, the one that was in <em>Girls</em>?</p>

<p>In order to watch the Swedish duo perform in the intimate setting you&apos;ll need... money. You&apos;ll basically just need money. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101416/http://standardnyc.myshopify.com/products/stand-for-icona-pop">It costs $250 per person</a> for standing room only, and if you want to sit down that&apos;ll be $750 per person please (update: put your stack of money away, that option is sold out now). You&apos;ll also need to buy some nice threads, as it&apos;s black tie only. OR you can just stand around in Le Bain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101416/http://standardnyc.myshopify.com/products/generalites">for 50 bucks</a>. </p>

<p>Or you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101416/http://phish.com/tours/new-years-run-2013-2014/">try to for a miracle</a> for the ultimate New Year&apos;s Eve experience.</p>
