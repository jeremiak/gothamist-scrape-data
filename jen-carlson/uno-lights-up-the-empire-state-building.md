</div></div>					<p>As you know, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034728/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/09/dogs_will_have_their_days_at_the_we.php">Westminster Kennel Club</a> is holding their 133rd annual All-Breed Dog Show, but did you know that 2008 Best in Show winner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034728/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/13/top_dog_the_num.php">Uno</a>, helped light up the Empire State Building in its honor? His little award-winning paw switched on the purple and yellow lights at 10 this morning. Now he&apos;s not only the first beagle to win Westminster, but also the first beagle to get this ESB honor. Oh Uno, what <em>can&apos;t</em> you do?</p>
