</div></div><p>Graphic designer/urban planner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130310211531/http://www.candychang.com/design/pages/tenant_flashcards.htm">Candy Chang</a> has created a set of flash cards on New York tenants&apos; rights that she tells us, &quot;translates scary legal jargon into a fun and friendly format.&quot; Learn about painting your apartment, privacy, security deposits, rent stabilization, repairs, and all the other fun stuff you get along with being a tenant. </p>

<p>The 30-card set is for purchase, and the $10 goes to the non-profit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130310211531/http://www.tandn.org/">Tenants &amp; Neighbors</a>.</p>
