<p>If you saw some naked people this morning it might be refreshing to know it wasn&apos;t for an ad campaign&#x2014;instead, it was <em>for art</em>. Artist Zefrey Throwell got 50 people together around Wall Street, all to impersonate different occupations in that area&#x2014;and for a few moments, they got naked for their work. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110809/http://gawker.com/5826489/naked-people-descend-on-wall-street">Videos</a> and photos of Throwell&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110809/http://www.zefrey.com/">Ocularpation: Wall Street</a> project have been surfacing (send your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110809/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">our way</a>!), as reports come in that at least a few participants were detained for their roles in it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110809/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/bares-not-bulls-on-wall-street/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">The NY Times</a> reports that just after 7 a.m., police detained three people involved&#x2014;they were dressed (or not dressed) as a dog walker, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110809/http://feathertreephotography.tumblr.com/post/8338300654/cleaning-up-wall-st-with-transparency-zefrey">a janitor</a>, and a stock broker. (At press time, there have been no reports of any participants playing the role of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141228110809/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadpanda">Sad Panda</a>.)</p>

<p>Throwell says he wanted &quot;to expose the realities of working on the nation&#x2019;s financial artery as a commentary on the state of the economy.&quot; Which is definitely where people&apos;s minds naturally go when they see naked ladies.</p>
