<p>Italian illustrator Matteo Pericoli &quot;has executed an intimate collection of drawings &#x2014;&#xA0;glimpses of the city, as seen from the windows of prominent New Yorkers.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101000016/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/whats-the-view-like-from-your-window/">CityRoom</a> takes a look at his new book <em>The City Out My Window: 63 Views of New York</em>, which includes drawings and stories inspired by them. For example, Stephen Colbert says of his view: &quot;Because my studio is directly across from a windowless telecommunications skyscraper whose peak bristles with microwave transmitters, when I think of my view mostly I think about cancer, so I try not to think about it at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, this all sounds very similar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101000016/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/11/announcing-the-view-from-your-window.html">to Andrew Sullivan&apos;s</a> fantastic project titled &quot;The View From My Window&quot;. Inspired by the two, we ask you to now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101000016/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> the view from <em>your NYC window</em> (include location, or at least borough). We&apos;ll compile the best and post as many views from city windows as we can! We&apos;ve started with our office view... as you can see we get to look at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101000016/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/18/verizon.php">Verizon Building</a> all day long.</p>
