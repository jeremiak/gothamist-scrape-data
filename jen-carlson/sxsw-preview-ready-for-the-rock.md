Today kicks off the music portion of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a>. Gothamist heads out before sunrise on Friday morning to the great state of Texas. And we&apos;re totally planning on messing with it, even if that t-shirt in Urban Outfitters says not to. We defy you t-shirt!<br>
Ahem. Anyway, as we said, we&apos;ll be going to Austin to cover the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> music conference for you. We use the term &quot;conference&quot; lightly, as we&apos;ve been told that SXSW is mostly just one giant party with free alcohol and bands playing at all hours of the day and night. All of these factors will make our coverage that much more interesting (we want to let you know that we really do love you, we&apos;ll probably be saying it a lot in our upcoming SXSW posts and we don&apos;t want you to think it&apos;s the drink talking. No, we love you man.) <br>
We&apos;ll also be posting some non-NY related things (gasp!) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://www.austinist.com/">Austinist</a> this week, so be sure to check that out for more in-depth coverage. <br>
As for New York bands, we&apos;re personally psyched to check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://www.theholdsteady.com/">The Hold Steady</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://www.braziliangirls.info/">Brazilian Girls</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://www.ambulancenyc.com/">Ambulance LTD</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://www.plusmin.us/">+/-</a> and whatever else we can cram into our schedules. We don&apos;t plan on sleeping, so feel free to make suggestions...<br>
After our &quot;live from Austin&quot; coverage stay tuned next week for some SXSW tour diaries, we got some of our favorite New York bands to jot down some of their experiences in Austin and we promise not to censor anything. <br>
For those of you not going, or for those who haven&apos;t left yet, check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113606/http://2005.sxsw.com/player/player.php">SXSW player</a> which streams all of the bands playing this year.</p>
