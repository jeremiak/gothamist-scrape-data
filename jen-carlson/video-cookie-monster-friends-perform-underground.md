title: Video: Cookie Monster & Friends Perform Underground
---

	
										<p>The bleak underground recently got a little brighter with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145033/http://www.myspace.com/xylopholks">the Xylopholks</a> (who you&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145033/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/26/early_addition_206.php">seen here before</a>). The ragtime-playin&apos; troupe dons colorful, furry costumes while they play in the subway system, including a Cookie Monster, a chicken, a pink gorilla, and a skunk. They recently talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145033/http://flavorwire.com/17685/exclusive-x-is-for-xylopholks">Flavorpill</a> about the upcoming humid season, and said, &quot;When we first started out, Pinky (Bridget) thought about doing a swimsuit version for the summer.&quot; This might even draw more attention from the cops, however, who have already nabbed them for playing illegally. Check out their style in the video...</p>

<p>An eyewitness to one of their performances tells us, &quot;The funniest thing is what the Cookie Monster does when they aren&apos;t playing. I got on the train, and as the doors were closing, he runs up and is rubbing his mouth all over the doors screaming &apos;Cooookies!&apos;&quot; They&apos;ve got some legal shows coming up (as well as an audition for Music Under New York), including one at National Underground tomorrow, and Rockwood Music Hall on April 30th. Maybe they&apos;ll invite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422145033/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/26/spotted_sad_panda.php">Sad Panda</a> to join the group?
