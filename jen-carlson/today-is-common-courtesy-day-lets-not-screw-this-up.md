<p>Hi, <em>how are you?</em> Today is Common Courtesy Day, which you probably know already because everyone was so accommodating and helpful and sweet during your morning commute. Just like every day in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228102739/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/new_yorkers_always_in_such_a_big_hu.php">slow-paced</a> New York City. Let&apos;s try not to be monsters today, okay? Attempt to give up your coveted seat to someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228102739/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/30/pregnant_women_find_subway_seats_ha.php">who needs it</a> on the subway, or hold the door open for someone, or at least don&apos;t hit the &quot;door close&quot; button when you hear someone approaching the elevator. <em>It is the least you could do.</em> Yes, this Common Courtesy Day is going to be extra challenging, because it&apos;s a rainy Monday, which means we are all in bad moods like Garfield <em>and</em> we even have to be nice to that guy with the giant umbrella taking up the entire sidewalk.</p>

<p>If you need to brush up on your courtesy skills, here are some refreshers:</p>
