<p>Today was a big day for all of us: we found out there are now TWO Ryan Goslings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/video_how_to_look_like_ryan_gosling.php">You know, <em>basically</em></a>. But it was even a bigger day for America&apos;s newest Ryan Gosling, who goes by the name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643/https://twitter.com/#!/joeythompson23">Joey Thompson</a>. Throughout the day the Gosling lookalike&apos;s video explaining &quot;how to look like Ryan Gosling&quot; has made its way around the internet, and now he&apos;s handling the viral after effects like a real pro. We asked him some questions...</p>

<p><strong>Who was the first person to tell you you looked like Ryan Gosling?</strong> I was first told I looked like Ryan Gosling when I was 16.  I was at a Clemson University football tailgate and my friend&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s college roommate told me that (I thought this girl was a smoking college babe at the time).  She was like &#x201C;you look like that guy from &#x201C;The Notebook.&#x201D;  I was like &#x201C;cool&#x201D; then I went back to thinking about Pokemon or whatever dumb thing I did at the time.  I was na&#xEF;ve.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4rygo0212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/4rygo0212.jpeg" width="640" height="369" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Is there a particular Ryan Gosling character you feel you look the most like? Notebook Gosling? Drive Gosling?</strong>  I like the Notebook Gosling because he delivers a powerful love story. (True story, I listen to <em>The Notebook</em> soundtrack when I study or write just because it keeps me cool.)  I don&#x2019;t want to sound sappy but I think it&#x2019;s cool when a guy finds a girl that he is willing to go all out for, maybe even build a house for her. Lately I feel like the Drive Gosling.  I&#x2019;ve started trying to stunt around in my car some.  I&#x2019;ll roll the windows down and blast &#x201C;Song 2&#x201D; by Blur and just floor it on open roads.  It kind of makes me feel like a bad ass.</p>

<p><strong>Your video is getting a lot of attention today, has your day been crazy?</strong> Today has been out of control.  This is not the first viral video I&#x2019;ve been a part of so I kind of have a grip on things, I think.  We had 2 videos get on Comedy Central&#x2019;s Tosh.0 and we had a rap video we made about the University of South Carolina football team do some damage.  Today is certainly the biggest vid explosion ever though.  I&#x2019;m just humbled and excited to see where this goes.  I literally told my mother 2 nights ago that &#x201C;I want to do this kind of stuff for the rest of my life.&#x201D;  I&#x2019;m just blessed.  We&#x2019;re trying to get me on the Ellen Show to meet Ryan.  There&#x2019;s a big push for that.  I know he and I could riff off each other. </p>

<p><strong>Do you want to give her a message?</strong> Ellen needs to know that if she has me and Ryan on her show it&#x2019;s going to be the biggest man hunk explosion of all time.  I think we&#x2019;re both funny guys and could definitely make for an unforgettable segment that would make the ladies faint and the fellas laugh.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2rygo0212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2rygo0212.jpeg" width="640" height="493" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Any marriage proposals?</strong> The funny story is I was really down on my luck about girls.   There was this girl that I had a crush on and I told her ,&#x201C;you are honestly the prettiest girl I&#x2019;ve ever seen in my life and I mean it.&#x201D;  She said, &#x201C;let&#x2019;s be friends.&#x201D;  I was crushed a bit, but now I think I&#x2019;m going to be okay.  Girls keep asking to marry me and father their children.  It&#x2019;s getting nuts.  I&#x2019;m just having fun with it all.  Before I had problems finding a girlfriend.  Now I think it&#x2019;s going to be hard narrowing it down to a winner, but I know she&#x2019;ll come along.</p>

<p><strong>What would you say to the real Ryan Gosling if you met him?</strong> If I ever met the real Ryan Gosling I would ask him to hang out with me then make a video about &#x201C;How to Look/Or Be Like Joey Thompson.&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="3rygo0212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/3rygo0212.jpeg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Who would you rather: Rachel McAdams or Eva Mendez?</strong>  Rachel is a little cutie but she broke his heart.  I gotta go with Eva.  She is bad.  I mean that in a positive way.  She&#x2019;s a total dime.  If I dated her I would need oven mitts because she is one hot mamacita.</p>

<p><strong>If you saw a fight happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/video_ryan_gosling_breaks_up_nyc_st.php">in the streets of New York,</a> what would YOU do?</strong> If I saw a fight happening in the streets of NY I would run full speed and spear the clown guy who was instigating it.  I played football a lot of my life so I think those instincts would come out.  I don&#x2019;t have time for people who start clownery.  This is for certain.</p>

<p><strong>Can you give us a &quot;Hey Girl...&quot; line?</strong> I hope my mom doesn&#x2019;t see this.  &#x201C;Hey Girl&#x2026; Are you into beastiality, because I&#x2019;m an animal.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Bradley Cooper getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/photosvideo_protesters_outside_of_p.php">Sexiest Man Alive</a>?</strong> That was a bogus decision and everyone knows it.  I think Ryan got the better end of that deal though because the outrage behind the decision really stirred up some positive press for him.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, any thoughts on one of Gosling&apos;s fiercest competitors, James Franco?</strong> I co-run <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045643/http://dinobritevideo.com/">a production company</a> for my living so I stay up on films.  I think James Franco is a phenomenal actor.  I think they should team up and do a movie together.  It would be like Redford and Newman in &#x201C;Butch Cassidy.&#x201D; No need to compete.</p>

<p>And incase you missed it this morning, here&apos;s that video again: </p>
