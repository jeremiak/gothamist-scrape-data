<p>To use grating, twenty-something, Shoshanna-speak: it&apos;s simply <em>amazeballs</em> that it has taken this long for someone to attempt a reality version of the hit show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108032646/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>GIRLS</em></a>. Exploiting real people for a real life take on the series just seems so <em>natural</em>, considering the HBO version was wildly popular before the first season was even finished&#x2014;and now someone finally got the ball rolling. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108032646/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tfr/3555337768.html">a Craigslist posting</a>, an Emmy-winning production company is looking for young women who fancy themselves <em>GIRLS</em> girls. They write:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Ever feel like life in the big frantic city is just too much? Are you a twenty-something young woman seeking fame, fortune, love or even a hookup with potential? How do you get from here to there when you can&apos;t even get a seat on the L train! Come to a casting call with our Emmy-winning production company and tell us your dreams and woes, your highs and lows, your tales of *** in the city and the outrageous opportunities that have come your way. Is your circle of friends bound together by not just the parties, fights, and brunches but frequent bouts of commiserating over your struggles? It isn&apos;t easy taking the road less travelled, but making it as a writer, designer, entrepreneur, actress/model or glorified dog walker never is!

<p>The real life television show we are making follows the trials and tribulations of an ensemble of wise-beyond-their-years young ladies. We are with you living the dream in hipster Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. Only well educated and cultured extroverts need apply. Are you thinking about that show <em>GIRLS</em>? Well we didn&apos;t say it but... now that you mention it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Are you a Hannah, Marnie, Jessa, or Shoshanna? Email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108032646/mailto:blinktipcasting@gmail.com">blinktipcasting@gmail.com</a> so they can suck your soul for original $tories, you unique little millennial snowflake you.
