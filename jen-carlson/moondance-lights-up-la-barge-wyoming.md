</div></div>					<p>Cheryl and Vince Pierce, the Wyoming couple who purchased the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723020307/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/11/moondance_diner.php">Moondance Diner in 2007</a>, have finally opened its restored doors in LaBarge. This all went down on January 12th, but new photos have come out showing the establishment in all its circa-1984 splendor. </p>

<p>The Pierces keep locals updated on news of the diner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723020307/http://www.historicmoondancediner.com/news">via their blog</a>, and recently noted their expanded hours&#x2014;so it looks like business is going well. And the diner itself is certainly looking better than it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723020307/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/07/moondance_1.php">when it first arrived</a> at its new home. Meanwhile, its old stomping grounds on 6th Avenue will eventually house a hotel, which is currently set to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723020307/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/02/24/goodnight_moon_sohos_grand_street_hotel_revealed.php">look like this</a>.</p>
