<p>This new timelapse, titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427173446/https://vimeo.com/42650004">The Manhattan Project</a> and created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427173446/http://cameron-michael.tumblr.com/">Cameron Michael</a>, shows the city over about a five and a half month period of time, during which time Michael lugged 120 lbs of gear around capturing the perfect shots. </p>

<p>This week, with the completion of his project, he explained his motivation to us: &quot;As far as I can tell, from all my searching on the internet, I can not find one montage of Manhattan that goes past just tall buildings, cars, and bridges. Now, I of course covered those aspects of the city in my project, but I wanted to show timelapse <em>everything</em>, from the subways of NYC, the Parks, the Cars, the views, and the people living in it.&quot; Check it out:</p>
