<p>Between the NYPL, the MCNY, the Municipal Archives, the Library of Congress, and countless other resources holding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122627/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">images from New York City&apos;s past</a>, you could almost visually recreate an older version of the city on your desktop. That&apos;s pretty much what one man&#x2014;software engineer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122627/https://twitter.com/danvdk">Dan Vanderkam</a>&#x2014;has done, using the NYPL&apos;s massive database of images. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122627/http://www.oldnyc.org/">OldNYC</a> is almost overwhelming in size, placing tens of thousands of historic images over a map of New York City, allowing you to step back to a time when your Chase Bank was shoe cobbler, and your Duane Reade was a speakeasy. Just click on an address or intersection and you&apos;ll see How Things Used To Be. The map doesn&apos;t include modern day images, but you can compare on your own&#x2014;here&apos;s 345 Madison Avenue in 1923, versus today.</p>

<span class="photo_caption">345 Madison Avenue (via NYPL and Google Maps)</span></p>

<p>Most of the photos are from 1924 to the 1940s, culled from the work of photographer Percy Loomis Sperr. Imagine how much more time you&apos;d spend in the past if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122627/http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/changing-new-york#/?tab=about">Berenice Abbott&apos;s photos</a> from the 1930s were added. And maybe we need a separate map that just brings us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122627/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php">back to the 1980s</a>.</p>
