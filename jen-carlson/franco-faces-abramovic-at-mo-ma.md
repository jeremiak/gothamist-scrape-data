<p>The latest famous face to sit in front of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610051441/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovi%C4%87">Marina Abramovi&#x107;</a> at MoMA was none other than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610051441/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a>, who got up bright n&apos; early this morning to be first in line to sit across from the performance artist. (Though we&apos;re guessing that celebrities get to cut the line&#x2014;we hear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610051441/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000614/">Hans Gruber</a> was first yesterday.) Wonder if Franco lasted longer than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610051441/http://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/4479611106/in/set-72157623741486824/">Lou Reed&apos;s 9 minutes</a>...</p>
