Remember when Manet&apos;s <em>Le d&#xE9;jeuner sur l&apos;herbe</em> (aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602024004/http://www.essentialart.com/acatalog/Edouard_Manet_prints_Luncheon_on_the_Grass.html"><em>Luncheon on the Grass</em></a>) was a huge scandal to those prudish art critics back in the 1800s? Well they&apos;d certainly be shielding their eyes and turning their noses up at the 3rd Ward&apos;s latest exhibit&#x2014;the Brooklyn establishment just announced an open call for those upskirt shots you&apos;ve been saving on your cell phone. (<em>You know who you are.</em>) They&apos;re specifically asking for &quot;well-executed, erotic expressions made only with a cell phone.&quot; Videos, photos and texts will all be accepted, and the winner will take home 500 bucks&#x2014;enough to buy a mediocre SLR for a future in less pixelated porn. Meanwhile, the best of the best will be picked for a future group show. While their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602024004/http://www.3rdward.com/sexcells">Sex Cells submission form</a> comes with a disclaimer, nowhere does it say that the subject of your pervy pics need to be made aware of their possible public display. You are all fair game!</p>
