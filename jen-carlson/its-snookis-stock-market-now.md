</div></div><p>This morning the cast of <em>Jersey Shore</em> rang that bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131807/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38431673/ns/business-us_business/"><em>Today</em></a> show says it was &quot;one of the more anticipated opening bell ceremonies in some time.&quot; </p>

<p>Reportedly this was the most crowded it&apos;s been in years; The director of floor operations at Sunrise Securities described the scene, saying: <strong>&quot;It was like a car crash here this morning; people couldn&apos;t help but stare. It was very crowded, but most of the crowd were summer interns. It was like P.T. Barnum&apos;s freak show was in town.</strong>&quot; While some traders weren&apos;t impressed, others were reportedly heard screaming for Snooki. <em>Sigh.</em> As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131807/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/07/27/128795416/-jersey-shore-cast-rings-opening-bell-at-nyse-or-is-nothing-sacred">NPR asked</a>, &quot;Is nothing sacred?&quot; At least J-WOWW classed it up by wearing a suit.</p>
