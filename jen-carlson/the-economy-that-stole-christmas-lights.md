<p>Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145924/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/plug_pulled_on_gct_laser_show_fMJQUSBOlNSJUUvmH9M6CP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">this is</a> <em>almost</em> as depressing as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145924/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/mistletoe_becoming_exctinct.php">the death of mistletoe</a>. Money troubles have put an end to the Grand Central Terminal holiday light show. The show has been going on for three years, but those looking for a little holiday light at the end of the tunnel this year <em>won&apos;t find it</em>. On the upside, this will speed up your hurried and already crazed yuletide exodus from the city, as it&apos;s sure to cut down on upward-pointing tourist cameras.</p>
