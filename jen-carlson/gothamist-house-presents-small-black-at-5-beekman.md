</div></div>					<p>We recently had the chance to check out the amazing, abandoned 5 Beekman building (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728075749/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/16/abandoned_building_to_become_palace.php">you know the one</a>); much of the interior has been shuttered since the 1940s, including the gorgeous atrium on the 9th floor. On a recent, rainy day, we took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728075749/http://www.myspace.com/smallblacksounds">Small Black</a> up the slow, slightly scary elevator to perform some songs up there for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728075749/http://gothamist.com/tags/liveatgothamisthouse">our Gothamist House series</a>. Enjoy the videos, filmed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728075749/http://www.foglightfilms.com/">Foglight Films</a>, below. (And stay tuned for many more photos and details on 5 Beekman, coming up next week.)</p>
