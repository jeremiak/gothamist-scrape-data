<p>Shuffleboard will have been in America for 100 years next year, meaning it&apos;s about damn time that New York City gets a shuffleboard club. Earlier this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070000/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/why_arent_there_any_real_shuffleboa.php">we wondered</a> how someone hadn&apos;t opened one already... and lo and behold, now we&apos;re hearing that a club may be opening early next year. </p>

<p>We don&apos;t have a lot of details right now, but we hear your grandparent&apos;s favorite game could get a proper welcome to the city, with a 17,000-square-foot club in Gowanus. The aim is to offer up food and drinks, and even <em>roof</em> shuffleboard&#x2014;and make no mistake about it, the owners are aiming for a shuffleboard club, not a bar with a shuffleboard court in it.</p>

<p>We&apos;re crossing our fingers that everything goes smoothly and we&apos;ll be sending some biscuits down the courts by Spring 2013. If not, we&apos;re moving to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070000/http://stpeteshuffle.com/">St. Petersburg</a>.</p>
