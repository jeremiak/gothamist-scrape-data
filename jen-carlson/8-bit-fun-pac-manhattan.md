<p>We&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184934/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/08/8_bit_map.php">a few</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184934/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/08/video_5.php">attempts</a> of combining the 8-bit aesthetic with New York City, but this is by far the best. Illustrator Jamie Sneddon and photographer Kevin Rozario-Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184934/http://www.8-bitscapes.com/">joined forces</a> and created a realistic Manhattan setting for Pac-Man (and of course the ghosts forever-chasing him). Can you tell what cross streets they&apos;re on?
