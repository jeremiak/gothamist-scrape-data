We called up the Board of Elections to check in on this very important situation, and they told us they don&apos;t think New York City has <em>ever</em> handed out the little badges of civic duty. When&apos;s the last time you received one? Vote &quot;yes&quot; to bring them back in four years, but for now, you can make your own -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000015/http://www.flickr.com/photos/miscellanea/3002972826/">one Flickr user</a> has provided a Hi-Res photo of her sticker, just print it out and tape it on! Over in DC, each jurisdiction has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000015/http://dcist.com/2008/11/04/who_has_the_best_i_voted_stickers.php">a different design</a>!</p>
