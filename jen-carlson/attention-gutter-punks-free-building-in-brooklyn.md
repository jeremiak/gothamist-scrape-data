										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="freebuilding1009.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/freebuilding1009.jpg" width="90" height="85" class="image-right"> </span>Do you want 14 residential units and 3 commercial units in beautiful Brooklyn for the low low price of: Free? The blogger at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144544/http://www.hawthornestreet.com/2009/10/moses-fried.html">Hawthorne Street</a> points to Prospect Lefferts&apos; 205 Parkside Avenue, &quot;an abandoned rathole&quot; that has been vacant since 1979 and is now being advertised as free (though they doubt it&apos;s <em>really</em> free). There&apos;s even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144544/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/reo/1442834810.html">Craigslist ad</a> backing up the sign on the building. Any takers? <strong>UPDATE:</strong> The new rumor is that this is a prank. We still bet squatters could get in a few months of free rent, however.
