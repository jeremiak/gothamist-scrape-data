<p>The fifth floor of the New Museum will be transformed into a spaceship next month. <em>A simulated interior of a spaceship.</em> For those with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428132226/http://dailyrefill.blogs.com/daily/2006/06/returning_to_sp.html"><em>Space Camp</em> dreams</a> lingering over from the 1980s, this is even better than Carsten H&#xF6;ller&apos;s crazy slide that took over the museum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428132226/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/20/last_chance_to_slide_new_museums_ca.php">last year</a>.</p>

<blockquote>For their presentation &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428132226/http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/report-on-the-construction-of-a-spaceship-module">Museum as Hub: Report on the Construction of a Spaceship Module</a>,&#x201D; tranzit will transform the Fifth Floor gallery of the New Museum into the simulated interior of a spaceship. The spacecraft, specially designed for the exhibition &#x201C;Report on the Construction of a Spaceship Module,&quot; is a composite of shuttles featured in Eastern European science-fiction films from the Cold War period. In its structure and design, it recalls future fantasies from the socialist Eastern Europe side of the Iron Curtain and explores the ideological role outer space played during this time.</blockquote>

<p>Surrounding the spacecraft will be 117 artworks, including video, sculpture, print, and installation, by a bevvy of artists from cities around Eastern Europe, all offering an allegory of &#x201C;anthropological science fiction.&quot; </p>

<p>The exhibition will blast off on January 22nd and run through April 6th, 2014. There will also be public programs throughout that time.</p>
