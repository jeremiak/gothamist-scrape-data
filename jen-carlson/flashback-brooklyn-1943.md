</div></div>					<p>In the past we&apos;ve taken looks back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/06/flashback_prospect_park.php">Prospect Park</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/27/supermarket.php">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> (and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/23/vinegar_hill_mansion.php">Commandant&apos;s House</a>), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/24/flashback_brooklyn_bridge.php?gallery0Pic=2#gallery">Brooklyn Bridge</a>, and the nearby area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/05/flashback_brooklyn_1936.php">in 1936</a>, amongst other corners of the borough.

<p>This is the year the movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/54280/Whistling-in-Brooklyn/overview"><em>Whistling in Brooklyn</em></a> came out and the year the novel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tree_Grows_in_Brooklyn_(novel)"><em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</em></a> hit bookshelves. Over at Ebbets Field, the 1943 Brooklyn Dodgers played 153 games during the regular season, winning 81 and losing 72 games (they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410173353/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/roster.php?y=1943&amp;t=BRO">finished 3rd</a> in position).</p>
