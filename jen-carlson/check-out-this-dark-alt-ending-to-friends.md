<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030842/http://gothamist.com/tags/friends"><em>Friends</em></a> went off the air over a decade ago, one fan fic writer has still been hard at work perfecting an alternate ending, which he delivered via Twitter this week. This is The One Where Things Get DARK. </p>

<p>In Gareth Stranks&apos;s version, the ending reveals that &quot;it was all the meth-addled fantasy of a homeless Phoebe as she stared through the window of Central Perk.&quot; He explains, &quot;Every kooky aside, every episode she made everything about her, every instance of how much an outsider she was... it all makes sense. All 10 seasons were merely a fevered imagination, projecting herself onto the lives of the other 5.&quot; In the real show, Phoebe did have a backstory that included being homeless, and once revealed that she was the one who mugged Ross when they were teenagers and she was living on the street.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how the whole alt ending would play out, according to Stranks:</p>

<p>This is like when <em>Felicity</em> ended and it turned out everything was taking place inside a shoe box or whatever.
