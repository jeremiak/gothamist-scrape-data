The trend began when a character on the Nickelodean series <em>iCarly</em> served up some sauce-coated strings of spaghetti in a hard taco shell... and now it&apos;s made it all the way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111174715/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/dining/06tacos.html?_r=3">the New York Times</a>. Kids who caught the episode have been requesting the dish for months, and moms are giving in nationwide.</p>

<p>Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, told the paper that &#x201C;Spaghetti tacos has made it possible to eat spaghetti in your car. It&#x2019;s a very important technological development. You don&#x2019;t even need a plate.&#x201D; (Uh oh, will we be spotting them<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111174715/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/train_pigs.php"> in the subway</a> soon?) Thompson also likened the pop culture phenomenon to the Festivus episode of <em>Seinfeld</em>.</p>

<p>As for the recipe, some moms are riffing off the original&#x2014;there&apos;s a dessert version, one with guacamole, one with Italian sausage and peppers. But for the purists, here&apos;s how it was done on the show; from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111174715/http://www.icarly.com/iBlogs/entry34.html">iCarly&apos;s website</a>: </p>

<ul><li>Get taco shells.
</li><li>Get spaghetti (with meat sauce).
</li><li>Get a BIG spoon.
</li><li>Use the BIG spoon to put spaghetti into taco shells.
</li><li>Eat.</li></ul>

<p>If you make your own version of the spaghetti taco, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150111174715/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us</a> your recipes and photos! It&apos;s only a matter of time before this dish is being served up in restaurants around town.</p>
