										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="barefootinpark1209.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205456im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/barefootinpark1209.jpg" width="350" height="247" class="image-left"> </span>Every year it&apos;s interesting to see the Smallest, Coolest Apartment contest winners at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205456/http://gothamist.com/tags/apartmenttherapy">Apartment Therapy</a>, but now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205456/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cozy_crazy_couple_makes_tight_studio_R15ToNFTaJE3c17zkw4efP">the NY Post</a> is claiming to have found <em>the</em> smallest apartment in all of the city. Zaarath and Christopher Prokop inhabit a 175-square-foot &quot;microstudio&quot; in Morningside Heights &#x2014; and it all sounds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205456/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQu51lzqb5U">very familiar</a>.</p>

<p>They purchased the apartment for $150,000 and moved in just three months ago, sharing their digs with two cats. How have they managed in the 14.9-foot-long and 10-foot-wide space? They don&apos;t cook, so cabinets in their kitchenette go towards storage space. The only clothes in the apartment seem to be their workout clothes, which they put on in the morning before jogging to their jobs in Midtown &#x2014; on the way they stop by one of the several dry cleaners they use to pick up work clothes. This means their closets are scattered throughout Manhattan, at various dry cleaners as well as their offices. </p>

<p>In two years when their mortgage is paid off, the couple plans to remodel &#x2014; adding a Murphy bed and larger windows. How long do you think the cats will be welcome housemates though?</p>
