</div></div>					<p>With all this rain it may not seem very much like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503102407/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/25/summer_in_the_city_1.php">summer</a> out there lately, but hopefully by the 4th will be all sunshine and fireworks. Here are some old images of New York City on Independence Day, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503102407/http://images.google.com/hosted/life">LIFE&apos;s photo archive</a>. Man, people really packed on to those beaches!</p>
