<p>The Greenwich Village Halloween Parade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180917/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/park_slope_halloween_parade_cancell.php">was canceled</a> last year when Hurricane Sandy hit. It was the first time in 39 years the parade didn&apos;t go on, and now it may not return this year either. You guys, we need to save the parade. If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180917/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/latest_kickstarter_for_grilled_chee.php">a goddamn Grilled Cheezus can be funded</a>, and a historic parade celebrating camaraderie, community, and the weirdness within us all <em>cannot</em>, we&apos;re doing everything wrong in life.</p>

<p>There is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180917/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/729950056/bring-halloween-back-to-nyc">a Kickstarter</a> aimed at raising the $50,000 it needs to go on, and so far they&apos;ve got around $11,000, with thirty days left to go. The organizers write:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Though nothing compares to the tragic loss of life and home caused by Sandy, the last minute cancellation was also a financial disaster for the Parade, putting its future in jeopardy. We fronted money for the parade that we never got the chance to make back. Months and months of work were lost. This is a huge obstacle for our tiny not for profit arts organization, but all of you are not tiny!  All of you together can make it happen. This year, we need to hear from you again. We need all of you who have ever come to watch the Parade or who danced in it. We have never asked before, but this situation is unprecedented.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>In other words: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923180917/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/photos_greenwich_village_halloween.php#photo-18">shit is fucked up and bullshit</a>. Let&apos;s do this New York.</p>
