<p>For those who don&apos;t want their books delivered to their doorstep by drone, Amazon is expanding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022001305/https://www.amazon.com/b?node=13270229011">their brick and mortar business</a> with a store in Manhattan. The (mostly) online retailer will open up a bookstore in the Shops in Columbus Circle in Time Warner Center on 59th Street. There&apos;s no opening date at this time, but they will likely open doors this spring.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022001305/http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14173514/amazon-books-physical-store-new-york-city-columbus-circle-2017">the Verge</a>, the NYC location comes after similar storefronts in Seattle, Portland, and San Diego (and there are also stores coming to Massachusetts and Chicago). The site notes that Amazon Books will &quot;offer equivalent prices to Amazon&apos;s online site for Prime customers, integration of Amazon and Goodreads reviews, and Kindle devices for purchase.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022001305/http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-open-first-manhattan-bookstore-1483580781">The Wall Street Journal</a> reports that the space is 4,000-square-feet store, and that &quot;the company is considering a location in the large shopping center under development in Hudson Yards&quot; to open in 2018.</p>

<p>Until we get this &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022001305/http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Youve_got_mail.html">goddamn piazza where people can mingle and mix and be</a>,&quot; here&apos;s a list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022001305/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/16/best_bookstores_nyc.php">our favorite independent bookstores in NYC</a>. Some still even exist.</p>
