                            <p>Besides literally <em>anything else</em>, what could be more original and unique than debuting your new music video all over Times Square on a Monday morning segment of Good Morning America? That&apos;s what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175001/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> did today, and it just looked kind of depressing? We used to see bigger crowds for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006175001/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/14/time_square_wit.php">TRL</a> and Red Lobster.</p>

<p>Anyway, can someone figure out how much it costs to rent out every single billboard in Times Square? Because that is apparently what she did even though probably no one could hear and it was barely noticeable since this just looks like Regular Times Square.</p>
