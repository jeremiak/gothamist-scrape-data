<p>This year&apos;s biggest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005030/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/miley_cyrus_vmas.php">controversial-but-really-not-controversial</a> star, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005030/http://gothamist.com/tags/mileycyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, will help us ring in 2014 like a wrecking ball, or whatever. Bring yer Molly! (Don&apos;t bring Molly. Or alcohol. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005030/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/new-years-eve/nye-faq/index.aspx#.UqoUg2RDuA0">Or backpacks</a>.) The 21-year-old announced the news on Twitter:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Smilers! There&apos;s been a change in my NYE plans. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005030/https://twitter.com/RyanSeacrest">@RyanSeacrest</a> asked me to perform in Times Square for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005030/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RockinEve&amp;src=hash">#RockinEve</a>!! &#x1F389;</p>&#x2014; Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005030/https://twitter.com/MileyCyrus/statuses/410998058483449856">December 12, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>But Ryan Seacrest was the first to announce Cyrus&apos;s appearance at this year&apos;s &quot;Dick Clark&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Rockin&#x2019; Eve&quot; on Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s show&#x2014;&quot;We just added Miley Cyrus to be in Times Square right before the ball drops. We try to look for the artist that&apos;s created a lot of buzz and had a really big year.&quot; Sorry Kanye, the congregated plebians just wouldn&apos;t have been able to handle your genius.</p>
