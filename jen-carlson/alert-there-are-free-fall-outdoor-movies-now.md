<p>Yesterday, just like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307225059/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/why_dont_we_have_outdoor_movies_in.php">we did</a> two years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307225059/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/29/fall_outdoor_movies_pls.php">we requested that Free Fall Outdoor Movies exist</a>. You know, like the Free Summer Outdoor Movies, but with more tolerable weather. Where you replace your beach towel with a Pendleton blanket. Your bottle of white with a bottle of red. Your boyfriend&apos;s t-shirt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307225059/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/fashion/hobo-chic-from-the-bindle-bros-of-brooklyn.html">and bindle</a> with a flannel and cable knit sweater.</p>

<p>We were ready to bury our dream under a pile of fallen leaves, but then someone from the Parks Department emailed us saying they <em>too</em> wanted Free Fall Outdoor Movies. And then, magically, they appeared. Thank you Parks Department! </p>

<p>The movies will screen in Brooklyn, and a rep for the department tells us, &quot;It&apos;s the first one we&apos;ve done... it is very Halloween themed, there are definitely some good films in the lineup.&quot; Indeed.</p>
