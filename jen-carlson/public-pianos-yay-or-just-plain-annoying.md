										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="pianoplayme.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205120im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/pianoplayme.jpg" width="300" height="291"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo by Luke Jerram</span></i></div> Beginning June 21st, British artist Luke Jerram will have installed 60 pianos throughout city parks and public spaces as part of an interactive public art installation (which has already hit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205120/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/arts/design/11pianos.html?_r=1">London</a>). And before you start plotting out some space for an upright in your studio apartment, yes, they will be chained to 90-lb cinder blocks to deter ambitious thieves.<p></p>

<p>Of his &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205120/http://www.streetpianos.com/nyc2010/">Play Me, I&apos;m Yours</a>&quot; project, Jerram told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728205120/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/21/2010-05-21_public_pianos_will_be_city_parks_forte.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;The pianos act as a blank canvas for others&apos; creativity.&quot; And one man&apos;s creativity is another man&apos;s headache! On top of being in louder areas like Times Square and the Coney Island Boardwalk, more serene spots will also get pianos&#x2014;like Fort Greene Park, McCarren Park and Prospect Park. </p>

<p>Allegedly strangers won&apos;t be the only ones pounding away on the ivories, some famous faces may also drop by for an impromptu concert (Alicia Keys has already been named as one). At the end of the summer the instruments will be donated to schools and community groups.</p>

<p>Speaking of pianos! This must be their year&#x2014;we recently saw a proposal to turn the Pearl Street Triangle in DUMBO into some sort of <em>Big</em>-esque interactive piano (see after the jump).</p>
