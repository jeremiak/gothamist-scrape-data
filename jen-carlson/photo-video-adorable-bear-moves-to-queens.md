<p>The Wildlife Conservation Society&#x2019;s Queens Zoo has welcomed a new Andean bear to their lot. Bouba is a two-year-old male who comes to Queens via France, and is sharing his new home with female Andean named Spangles. Ooh la la!<br>
 <br>
But does the 220-pound Bouba got what it takes to make it in the concrete jungle where dreams are made? Scott Silver, Animal Curator and Director of the Queens Zoo, thinks so! He says &#x201C;Bouba&#x2019;s energy will make him a star.&quot; The bears are also known as &quot;spectacled bears&quot; because some have white markings around their eyes that resemble eyeglasses. Sadly, Bouba doesn&apos;t have the Warby Parker Hipster Gene, but he&apos;s still pretty dope: </p>
