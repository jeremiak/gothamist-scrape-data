<p>Louie goes on hiatus. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204435/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/04/photo_louis_cks_yacht_gets_stuck_in.php">Buys a yacht</a>. Quietly returns to television. </p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204435/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> will be appearing at the Paley Center this Thursday (tickets on sale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204435/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/louis_ck_1.php">at noon today</a>!), we had no idea he was already filming the next season of <em>Louie</em>, set to return in 2014 after a <em>way too long hiatus</em>. Just the news we needed after the <em>forever end</em> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204435/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>.</p>

Looks like C.K. &amp; Co. will be filming tomorrow on both Bowery and Norfolk.</p>

<p>The show won&apos;t return to the air until May, so we&apos;ve got another eight months before we see him climb out of the subway and get a slice of pizza again.</p>
