<p>It&apos;s unclear if this man is trolling us, is participating in a piece of performance art, or if he&apos;s just sincerely transporting pad thai noodles <em>in an open wok</em> on a crowded subway while wearing clothing from Jimmy Buffet&apos;s closet. Does it even matter? </p>

<p>A tipster sent in this video and photo from last night&apos;s crowded rush hour 2 train, telling us this &quot;dude was holding a overflowing wok with a small lid that hardly covered its contents.&quot; The smell: &quot;Pungent.&quot; The scenario: &quot;Ridiculous.&quot; The dude: Real chill, very zen, probably stoned? You decide, and be sure to turn it up to 11 for his mellow announcement upon exiting: &quot;Pad Thai Noodles coming out. Pad Thai Noodles coming out.&quot; We&apos;re told that there was no visible spillage... so well done, sir.</p>

<p>This wasn&apos;t that quick of a trip; he was already on the train when our tipster got on at 34th Street, and he didn&apos;t exit until Chambers. So those noodles showed up at their destination even more chill than the dude carrying them.</p>
