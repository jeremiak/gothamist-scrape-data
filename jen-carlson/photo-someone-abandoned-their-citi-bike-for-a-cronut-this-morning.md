<p>This morning the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070712/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">Cronut</a> line at Dominique Ansel was already down the street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070712/https://twitter.com/moneyries/status/342599112778199041">by 7 a.m.</a> (the bakery, and <em>only purveyor of Cronuts&#x2122; in the universe</em>, doesn&apos;t open until 8 a.m.). And as if waiting on line to get the hottest pastry in town wasn&apos;t <em>enough</em>, one person actually abandoned a brand new precious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070712/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike</a> in order to get in on the sweet action.</p>

<p>The most &quot;on trend&quot; person in New York was spotted entering the bakery just before 9 a.m., when the line was still going strong, and our tipster tells us they used around 20 minutes of their &quot;free&quot; Citi Bike time to get the Cronuts. (The most you get at a time is 45 minutes, and that&apos;s only if you have an annual membership, otherwise it&apos;s 30 minutes.) If the bike, which you can see in this photo was left totally unattended, was stolen, this Cronut run would have cost over $1,000. (Totally worth it.)</p>
