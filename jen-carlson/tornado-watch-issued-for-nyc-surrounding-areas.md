<p>And Governor Cuomo has issued a statement, urging New Yorkers to exercise caution and &quot;prepare for severe thunderstorms, that could produce tornados, frequent cloud to ground lightning strikes and large hail as a cold front moves throughout the state that will produce severe weather.&quot; Cuomo noted that &quot;severe thunderstorms can occur very quickly and create extremely dangerous situations for communities in their path.&quot;</p>

<p>Additionally, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner John P. Melville said, &quot;We are monitoring the weather and are in constant contact with the National Weather Service as well as emergency managers in the affected areas.&quot; </p>

<p>Tornado Watches have been issued by the National Weather Service until 10 p.m. for Albany; Bronx; Broome; Chenango; Columbia; Delaware; Dutchess; Fulton; Greene; Hamilton; Herkimer; Kings; Madison; Montgomery; Nassau; New York; Oneida; Orange; Otsego; Putnam; Queens; Rensselaer; Richmond; Rockland; Saratoga; Schenectady; Schoharie; Sullivan; Ulster; Warren; Washington; and Westchester counties.</p>

<p>Cuomo&apos;s release included these tips: </p>

<p>Before the storm hits:<br>
</p><ul><li>Tie down or bring inside lawn furniture, trash cans, tools and hanging plants that could be projectiles during the storm.<br>
</li><li>If you have a basement, check sump pumps to ensure they are operating and be prepared to use a backup system.<br>
</li><li>Have a standby generator or alternative source of power available.<br>
</li><li>Check on neighbors, especially the elderly and disabled.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>As the storm approaches:<br>
</p><ul><li>Stay inside, away from windows and glass doors.<br>
</li><li>Charge your cellphones and important electronic devices<br>
</li><li>Stay off roads. If you are traveling, find safe shelter immediately.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>If you must travel:<br>
</p><ul><li>Do not attempt to drive over flooded roads turn around and go another way. Water moving at two miles per hour can sweep cars off a road or bridge.<br>
</li><li>Watch for areas where rivers or streams may suddenly rise and flood, such as highway dips, bridges, and low areas.<br>
</li><li>If you are in your car and water begins to rise rapidly around you, abandon the vehicle immediately.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>If you are at home or at work:<br>
</p><ul><li>Stay at home unless you have been ordered to leave. <br>
</li><li>Turn refrigerator to maximum cold and open only when necessary.<br>
</li><li>Turn off utilities if told to do so by authorities.<br>
</li><li>Turn off propane tanks.<br>
</li><li>Unplug major appliances.<br>
</li><li>Fill large containers with water.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>If winds become strong:<br>
</p><ul><li>Stay away from windows and doors even if they are covered.<br>
</li><li>Close all interior doors.<br>
</li><li>Secure and brace external doors.<br>
</li><li>If you are in a two or multiple-story house, go to an interior lower-floor room.<br>
</li><li>Remain indoors during a severe thunder storm. If warned of a tornado, go to a basement or other low area in your home or business or in a room with no windows.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>If you lose electrical service:<br>
</p><ul><li>Call your utility first to determine area repair schedules. Turn off or unplug lights and appliances to prevent a circuit overload when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate power has been restored.<br>
</li><li>Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to help reduce food spoilage.<br>
</li><li>If you have space in your refrigerator or freezer, fill plastic containers with water, leaving an inch of space inside each one. This will help keep food cold.</li></ul><p></p>
