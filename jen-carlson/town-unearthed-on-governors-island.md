<p>Ah, remember the good &apos;ol sock hop days of Governors Island? Jukeboxes blaring the latest tunes as teens gathered round milkshakes and cheeseburgers; the city skyline just off in the distance providing the perfect backdrop to the 50s soundtrack. No? You mean you don&apos;t remember the snow factory that manufactured snow year round? What an uneducated lot!</p>

<p>Or perhaps you&apos;re just not so easily tricked. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194123/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=1026">Scouting NY</a> had fun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194123/http://kottke.org/09/09/buried-city-on-governors-island">with some folks</a> this week by reporting on an archaeological dig on the island, but leaving out the fact that it&apos;s really just an art project. &quot;Since January, Belgian archaeologists have been working strenuously to excavate the ruins of a former Governors Island hamlet called Goverthing (a bastardization of a Dutch word). With a 400 year history dating back to Manhattan&#x2019;s first settlements, the hamlet was the last civilian colony on Governors Island by the 1950&#x2019;s. In 1954, the town was forcibly evacuated by the city of New York, who had deemed it a safety hazard for a variety of reasons, and effectively had it condemned. As demolition was not an option at the time, the hamlet was simply buried under tens of feet of soil and forgotten.&quot; </p>

<p>Check out the island&apos;s faux past for yourself; the installation is open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194123/http://archdig.wordpress.com/2009/07/19/open-from-september-10/">through October 11th</a>, and the massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194123/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/11/new_island_festival_opens_on_govern.php">New Island Festival</a> of art and performance continues on Governors Island through Sunday.</p>
