Hopefully you&apos;re washing down a St-Viateur bagel with a Tim Hortons coffee right about now in celebration. Now, let&apos;s get down to business... earlier this week when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035458/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/29/canada_day_tips_from_pat_kiernan.php">Pat Kiernan gave us tips</a> on how to properly pay homage to his homeland, we mentioned we&apos;d be running a little contest. Consider this your heads up! </p>

<p>Sometime after noon we&apos;ll be posting a trivia question on our Twitter feed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035458/http://twitter.com/gothamist">@Gothamist</a>), and so will Pat Kiernan (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035458/http://twitter.com/patkiernan">@PatKiernan</a>). If you know the answer, @ reply it to the respective Twitter handle, and you could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035458/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/20/ny1s_pat_kiernan_takes_gothamist_re.php">win a chance to eat poutine</a> at Mile End in Brooklyn with Pat (and us)! We&apos;ve reserved the place on July 15th, so make sure you&apos;re available that evening. And if you miss out on the Twitter contest, we&apos;ll also be picking another winner from our newsletter contest, so be sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035458/http://gothamist.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1ff83f6bd9b5621949725cf98&amp;id=b4f8dc6148">sign up</a> to get another shot.
