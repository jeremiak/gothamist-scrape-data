<p>PETA has dipped their toes in the porn business before, getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222020412/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/peta_is_basically_a_porn_site_now.php">Sasha Grey</a> to strip down for kittens and puppies or whatever. And now the animal rights organization wants to launch a porn website (www.PETA.xxx) to promote veganism... which sounds like maybe you&apos;d be seeing a bunch of cute guys and gals enjoying a naked tickle fight in a pool of tofu cubes, right? Think again! PETA plans to mix pornography with graphic footage of animal suffering.</p>

<p>Lindsay Rajt, PETA&#x2019;s associate director of campaigns, said in a statement, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re hoping to reach a whole new audience of people, some of whom will be shocked by graphic images that maybe they didn&#x2019;t anticipate seeing when they went to the PETA triple-X site.&quot; So it&apos;s like, a trick? Or perhaps PETA is just up to their old tricks again...</p>

<p>Jennifer Pozner, executive director of the New York-based advocacy group Women In Media &amp; News, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222020412/http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/09/19/peta-porn-site-will-raise-veganism-awareness-peta-says/">called the non-profit out</a>, saying, &quot;They have consistently used active sexism as their marketing strategy to garner attention. Their use of sexism has gotten more extreme and more degrading.&quot;</p>
