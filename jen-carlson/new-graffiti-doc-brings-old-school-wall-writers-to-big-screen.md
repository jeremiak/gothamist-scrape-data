<p>The producer of <em>Exit Through The Gift Shop</em>, Roger Gastman, is going back to the 1960s and &apos;70s for his new documentary, <em>Wall Writers: Graffiti In It&apos;s Innocence</em>. While the original taggers he documents were merely vandals back then, they (Taki 183, Cornbread, Coco 144, et al) are now the pioneers of graffiti, often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115756/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/arts/design/early-graffiti-artist-taki-183-still-lives.html">celebrated as artists</a>. The doc is narrated by John Waters, and the creators, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115756/http://hypebeast.com/2012/04/wall-writers-documentary-trailer/">just released</a> the below trailer, write:</p>

<blockquote>Through unprecedented access to TAKI 183, CORNBREAD, and a host of other legendary writers, Wall Writers tells the story of a time when underprivileged city kids refused to keep lurking in the shadows, when the streets were so wild that fame and infamy became indistinct, when art became a democracy and self-promotion became an art.</blockquote>
