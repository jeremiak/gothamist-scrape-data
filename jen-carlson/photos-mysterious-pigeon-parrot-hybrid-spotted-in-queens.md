<p>Over the weekend a couple of peculiar looking pigeons were spotted near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121639/http://gothamist.com/tags/5pointz">5Pointz</a>. Or are they parrots? Or are they both? <a href="flickr.com/photos/bytegirl">Our tipster</a> tells us she saw them on Jackson Avenue in Long Island City on Sunday, adding, &quot;I have never seen birds with this marking and have not been able to find anything about them online.  Maybe nature&apos;s protest against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121639/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/09/5_pointz_supporters_drape_building.php">the whitewashing of 5Pointz</a>?&quot; Or maybe a teenage pigeon got mad at mom and dad and rebelled by Manic Panic-ing her feathers? Or maybe these pigeons are just naturally cooler than the other pigeons? Or maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121639/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/05/23/are-parrots-actually-pigeons/">pigeons ARE parrots</a>? Or maybe someone is breeding parrots with pigeons and one day our streets will be so colorful? Or maybe a human dyed them for an art project (which happened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121639/http://www.designboom.com/art/colorful-pigeons-amongst-a-flock-of-grey-at-the-venice-biennale/">once in Venice</a>).</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to a local bird expert, as well as the Audubon Society for answers, and will update when we know more.</p>
