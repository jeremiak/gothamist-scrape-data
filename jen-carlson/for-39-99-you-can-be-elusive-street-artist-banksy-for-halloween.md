<p>Forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101006/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/28/how_to_be_dumb_new_york_things_for.php">our recommendations</a> on how to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101006/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> for Halloween... Ricky&apos;s NAILED IT. They nailed the Banksy Halloween costume. It&apos;s so accurate it&apos;s almost like Banksy designed it <em>himself</em>. Is Ricky&apos;s Banksy? Let&apos;s take a closer look:</p>

<p>First you&apos;ve got a t-shirt with photos of Banksy&apos;s artwork on it. How do you know Banksy doesn&apos;t wear t-shirts with photos of his own artwork on it? You&apos;ve never seen him. Besides, that kind of unexpected move would really fuck with people&#x2014;and that&apos;s <em>so Banksy</em>. &quot;Banksy would never wear his own artwork on a t-shirt, <em>are you sure about that</em>?&quot; You will convince at least one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101006/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/24/be_controversial_performer_miley_cy.php">Slutty Cyrus</a> at the party that you are Banksy.</p>

<p>But that&apos;s not all, Ricky&apos;s EXCLUSIVE $39.95 costume also includes a standard issue black eye mask, nothing fancy. Banksy wants people to know he&apos;s mysterious, but not in a flashy way. </p>

<p>The final touch? A spray can. For this, we had to reach out to Ricky&apos;s to find out what was actually in it. &quot;The can is full with temporary hair and body spray,&quot; a rep told us. Perfect for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306101006/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/08/the_guy_who_keeps_tagging_the_banks.php">OMAR-ing yourself</a> with.</p>
