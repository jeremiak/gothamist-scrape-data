Their eco, and sometimes expensive, demands are a product of everything from their education to pop culture--and they&apos;re spouting out phrases like, &quot;Every day is Earth Day&quot; whenever they hear the car idling for too long (good thing Santa runs on reindeer power!). One parent thinks his son &quot;takes it too far,&quot; as he&apos;s even foregone using his precious night lights! Will these miniature eco-troops grow out of their militant standards, or will they keep going until they save the world, one parent at a time?</p>
