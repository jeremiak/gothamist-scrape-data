<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033655/http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/directors/spike-lee-net-worth/">this website</a> that figures out celebrity net worths, Spike Lee is worth about $40 million. Even if that&apos;s off by tens of millions, it&apos;s safe to say that established filmmaker Spike Lee has a lot of money, and possibly even more connections. Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033655/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/spike_lee.php">corporate synergy</a>. And even without all of that, he managed to bring his first films to life on on tight budgets, presumably in a way that didn&apos;t take away from his vision. So why does Spike Lee need <em>your</em> $1.25 million to make his new film? Well, because other famous people did it <em>so why not</em>&#x2014;he explains in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033655/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spikelee/the-newest-hottest-spike-lee-joint">his Kickstarter video</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Last week one of my [NYU] students told me about two big developments with Kickstarter. There was a tv show called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033655/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/holy_crap_the_veronica_mars_movie_i.php"><em>Veronica Mars</em></a> that was cancelled, they raised FIVE MILLION DOLLARS on Kickstarter... And then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033655/http://laist.com/2013/04/24/zach_braff_launches_kickstarter_for.php">Zach Braff</a> from <em>Scrub</em>s, he raised THREE MILLION DOLLARS for his film. So I heard about that, I said, &apos;Oh snap.&apos; It&apos;s a very different climate now, the only way to ensure as an independent filmmaker that your vision gets on screen is if you bring the money to the table.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Below, you can watch his pitch&#x2014;towards the end you can see him pointing out the long list of films he&apos;s successfully created without our help, on a huge plaque that&apos;s outside of his tony Fort Greene offices. </p>

<p>Here, again, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420033655/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/kevin_smith_says_no_to_kickstarter.php">is Kevin Smith&apos;s &quot;PSA&quot;</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;As for funding the flick&#x2014;we nearly Kickstarted the budget back in November (talked about at great length here). But now I&apos;m feeling like that&apos;s not fair to real indie filmmakers who need the help. Unlike back when I made CLERKS in &apos;91, I&apos;ve GOT access to money now&#x2014;so I should use that money and not suck any loot out of the crowd-funding marketplace that might otherwise go to some first-timer who can really use it. So if I can get away with it, I&apos;m gonna try to pay for CLERKS III myself. As much as I love the crowd-funding model, that&apos;s an advancement in indie film that belongs to the next generation of artists. I started on my own dime, and if I&apos;m allowed, I should finish on my own dime.&quot;</blockquote>Spike, why not use the money to fund one of your student&apos;s projects?<p></p>
