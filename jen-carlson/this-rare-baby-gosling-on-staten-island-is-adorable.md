<p>There&apos;s a rare attraction worth taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204907/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/28/bloomberg_wont_shut_up_about_how_th.php">the world&apos;s most romantic ferry ride</a> to&#x2014;the Staten Island Zoo has just welcomed a rare Cape Barren baby gosling. This is one of the rarest goose species in the world, and only surpassed in cuteness by the Ryan species. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204907/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130220/west-brighton/baby-goose-one-of-rarest-attractions-at-staten-island-zoo">to DNAInfo</a> the gosling was born on January 25th at the Livingston Ripley Waterfowl Conservancy in Connecticut, and was then transported to New York.</p>

<p>This adorable puffball&apos;s name is Toolka, which is the Australian aboriginal word for her species, which almost became extinct in the 1950s. She&apos;s still in the nursery, but will be walking around the zoo once we enter warmer weather days.</p>
