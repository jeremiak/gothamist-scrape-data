<p>Earlier today we did a casual scroll through our Facebook news feed, and saw the above photos which were either showing two gentlemen drinking soup, or downing a noodle-heavy Bloody Mary. We investigated, and <em>of course</em> it was the latter. And since we like to be servicey here, we asked creator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109123550/https://twitter.com/Matt_ThChThr">Matt Cook</a> more about this Thing, which he calls a Spaghetti Mary&#x2014;it comes with noodles, a meatball garnish, and seems sort of perfect for a Halloween party.</p>

<p>Cook (who created this for a Bloody Mary Takedown in Brooklyn over the weekend) was kind enough to share his recipe. Be warned, however, that &quot;one of the testers barfed at the end.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>SPAGHETTI MEATBALL BLOODY MARY</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mix:</strong><br>
Juiced tomatoes<br>
White Wine Vinegar<br>
Frank&apos;s Red Hot<br>
Celery Salt<br>
Oregano<br>
Basil<br>
Bay Leaf<br>
Sugar</p>

<p>Horrifyingly, Cook added that &quot;We ran out of vodka so we spiked it with white whiskey.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Meatball:</strong><br>
Ground beef<br>
Diced onion<br>
Frank&apos;s Red hot<br>
Worcestershire sauce<br>
Grated parmesan<br>
Oregano<br>
Red pepper flakes<br>
Garlic salt</p>

<p>Cook notes, &quot;I don&apos;t really measure, but there it is by descending quantity.&quot; But hey, you&apos;re making a Bloody Mary with spaghetti and meatballs so you can&apos;t really fuck this up beyond the concept itself.</p>
