The LAPD confirms the 38-year-old was found unresponsive in his Oakwood, California apartment, where his mother was also staying&#x2014;he was pronounced dead at Providence St. Joseph&apos;s Medical Center in Burbank. The LAPD believe the death was accidental. Haim battled drug addiction for much of his life, a subject that was touched upon in &quot;The Two Coreys,&quot; the A&amp;E; reality show he co-starred in with longtime friend Corey Feldman in 2007 and 2008. The show allegedly ended because Feldman refused to work with Haim until he got help. (Some clips of Haim after the jump.)</p>
