And that other West Elm.) it was a rugged little waterfront neighborhood where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014082427/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/28/1980s_brooklyn_bananarama.php">Bananarama did cocaine</a> with local dockworkers in a bar under the bridge. It&apos;s the spirit of that DUMBO that Tom Clancy&apos;s &quot;The Division&quot; video game brings us back to, albeit by way of apocalyptic measures. </p>

<p>The third-person shooter game was released on March 8th, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014082427/http://dumbonyc.com/blog/2016/03/22/tom-clancys-the-division-video-game-dumbo-brooklyn/">DUMBO NYC</a>, &quot;a rare opportunity: to stroll around Dumbo armed to the teeth, in the middle of an apocalypse&quot; caused by a smallpox pandemic. Here&apos;s what those iconic views from the cobblestone streets&#x2014;often filled with Instagrammers&#x2014;looks like as an agent of the Strategic Homeland Division tries to restore order.</p>

<p>Of course, the game expands outside of DUMBO, featuring many recognizable areas of the city, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014082427/http://www.redbrick.me/gaming/review-tom-clancys-division-beta/">one reviewer noted</a> it offers &quot;a genuinely impressive rendering of NYC... I need to make a point about how beautiful this game is. You&apos;re given swathes of to-scale New York City to delve into, and a huge amount of effort has gone into map construction.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the <em>very dramatic</em> trailer, showing more of NYC: </p>
