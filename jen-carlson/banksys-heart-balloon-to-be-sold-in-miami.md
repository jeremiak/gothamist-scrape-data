<p>So what will happen to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> pieces that remain in the city, since we can&apos;t just <em>enjoy them</em>? While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/new_banksy_is_in_queens.php#photo-1">the balloons</a> that went up for the street artist&apos;s grand finale remain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/banksy_balloon_being_processed_as_a.php">in police custody</a>, gallery owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://www.keszlergallery.com/">Stephan Keszler</a> has purchased the other balloon: the one painted on a wall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/07/photos_banksys_broken_heart_balloon.php#photo-1">in Red Hook</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/nyregion/balloons-a-gift-to-new-york-from-banksy-are-held-by-the-police.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">the NY Times</a>, the gallery owner&#x2014;who has purchased and resold Banksy&apos;s work before&#x2014;said he &quot;was contacted by half a dozen building owners who inadvertently ended up with Banksy originals on their properties [and] reached an agreement to buy the heart-shaped balloon dotted with bandages in Red Hook.&quot; The section the piece is on (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/red_hook_banksy_has_a_night_watchma.php">heavily guarded</a>) has now be taken out of the wall, and will be put on sale at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://www.art-miami.com/">Art Miami </a>next month. Even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/08/the_guy_who_keeps_tagging_the_banks.php">Omar got to it</a> with his spray paint first, he still expects it to sell for up to $400,000. </p>

<p>As for the real balloons being held by the NYPD, they could be worth about as much, but unless someone claims them it&apos;s unclear what will happen to them. Keszler believes the building owner has the rights to them, so it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if they ended up on the auction block.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152804/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/04/these_banksys_are_still_here_for_yo.php">still a few Banksys up</a> around town that you can see, and five are protected by plexiglass and gates.</p>
