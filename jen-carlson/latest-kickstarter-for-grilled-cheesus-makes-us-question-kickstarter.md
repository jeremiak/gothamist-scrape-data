title: Latest Kickstarter For "Grilled Cheesus" Makes Us Question Kickstarter

<p>Kickstarter is a really great idea, one that has helped many worthwhile projects get off the ground. However, lately it seems like everyone is asking for money, and the projects&apos; quality is becoming questionable. Case in point: a Brooklyn couple wants $25,000 to fund their &quot;Grilled Cheesus&quot; sandwich maker. A grilled cheese maker that burns Jesus on to your bread&#x2014;an idea that basically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602111618/http://www.amazon.com/Daily-Bread-Toaster-Company-jesus247/dp/B0042QRYO8">already exists</a> in many forms.</p>

<p>Anyway, Rob Corso and Meg Sheehan want you to fund their very important electronic grilled cheese sandwich press. They have somehow (a miracle?) already raised over $5,000 towards their project, which essentially they need funded so they can make more money by selling the novelty machine.  </p>

<p>It seemed like when it started, Kickstarter was a great place for creative projects to launch and worthwhile goals to be reached, but mass-producing a &quot;Grilled Cheesus&quot; sandwich press seems a little QVC to us. Should Kickstarter be more selective in choosing projects, or should we really be throwing money at a sandwich machine?:</p>
