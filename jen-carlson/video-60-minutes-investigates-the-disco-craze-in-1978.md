<p>In the late &apos;70s disco was as popular as it was ever going to get, and in 1978, <em>60 Minutes</em> was ON IT. Below is a 15-minute segment from Dan Rather, who goes deep into the dance world. He doesn&apos;t just visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095746/http://gothamist.com/tags/studio54">Studio 54</a>, but he explores the music genre through its demographic, the music industry, and conversations with Billboard magazine, as well as with folks at the record labels producing the genre&apos;s hits. You&apos;ll get a full scope of the disco machine and how it ran... and yes, you will also get shots of a young Rather reporting straight-faced from the colorful disco clubs of New York City.</p>
