                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="MALCOLMBREAKBAD.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061637im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/MALCOLMBREAKBAD.jpg" width="350" height="323"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Spoiler: Breaking Bad did not end where Malcolm in the Middle began</i></div> Most of the Gothamist staff doesn&apos;t have television&#x2014;many of our recaps are written in the early morning hours after a show airs and is made available on iTunes&#x2014;which means we&apos;re <em>pretty sensitive to spoilers</em>. Because of that, we do our best not to spoil anything in our main images, our headlines, or our ledes&#x2014;a standard we kept to during our <em>Breaking Bad</em> finale recap posted today. But we can&apos;t really do much about personally stopping you from clicking through&#x2014;if you didn&apos;t watch the finale yet, don&apos;t click on a recap. This seems to be common sense. But on occasion a reader does click through, and then goes Full Heisenberg on us. From the inbox this afternoon:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;Would you PLEASE stop printing recaps that spoil shows like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061637/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/breaking_bad_series_finale_recap.php"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061637/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/breaking_bad_series_finale_recap.php"><em>Homeland</em></a>?  You know not everyone is watching that shit live right?  I know you think you write clever headlines that don&apos;t really spoil it, but THEY DO.  Some of us are still on season 3 for fuck&apos;s sake.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Here are some fairly obvious tips for those who easily cry spoiler:</p><ul><li>Avoid Twitter, Facebook, or RSS feeds of any kind if you know an episode you haven&apos;t watched, but plan to, has just aired (or is in the midst of airing).<br>
</li><li>Wear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061637/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va6nRaZ9eRg">earmuffs</a>?<br>
</li><li>If you really don&apos;t want to have a show spoiled for you (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061637/http://theweek.com/article/index/239614/why-we-need-to-do-away-with-spoiler-alerts">some say</a> this is impossible these days), then watch it in a timely manner. Even if you don&apos;t have TV, these shows are all easily available online within hours of them airing. <br>
</li><li>If you are catching up on a show that started (or ended) years ago, then you will undoubtedly, one day, when you least expect it, run in to a spoiler. Become okay with this.</li></ul>There&apos;s a shelf-life on sympathy for spoilers, and if you&apos;re going to cry about finding out <em>Newhart</em> was all just a dream decades after its series finale aired, then you need to either re-prioritize things you get upset about, or watch TV more frequently. We recommend the former.<p></p>

<p>It is worth noting here that neither DCist&apos;s <em>Homeland</em> nor our <em>Breaking Bad</em> headlines today spoiled anything, even if you haven&apos;t started watching those shows at all. But God forbid you glanced at a Daily News cover this morning (we have redacted their major spoilers, but you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061637/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/breaking-bad-spoiler-daily-news-cover.html">savor the real deal here</a>). As you can see, they also spoiled the final score of a football match:</p>
