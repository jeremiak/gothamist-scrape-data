title: Gothamist Music Picks: The "Please Excuse Our Appearance As We Undergo Renovations" Edition
---

	
										<p>We hope you like change, because there&apos;s sure a lot of it when it comes to who&apos;s writing the music picks. Now, on to the picks...while we&apos;ll be down in Austin for SXSW this week, we aren&apos;t taking <em>every</em> band with us. There will be plenty to rock out to in the city, and as an added bonus, it&apos;s St. Patrick&apos;s Day this weekend...so your rock will be mixed with green beer. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2006_03_arts_isobel.jpg"><img alt="2006_03_arts_isobel.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420im_/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2006_03_arts_isobel-thumb.jpg" width="175" height="265" align="right" hspace="5"></a>Tonight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.thepresets.com/">the Presets</a> are playing the brand new(ish) south of Delancey club Fontana&apos;s. It&apos;s pop noir set to a tight beat that&apos;ll make you think about dancing. Of course you won&apos;t <em>actually</em> dance, because you never do, do you? We&apos;ll be enjoying a much more mellow tone at Joe&apos;s Pub for ex-Belle &amp; Sebastian singer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.isobelcampbell.com/">Isobel Campbell</a> [at right]. If you can&apos;t check her out tonight, she&apos;ll be at Southpaw on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The publisher of this site once told us he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.jamesblunt.com/">James Blunt</a>&apos;s song from <em>Smallville</em> stuck in his head, we never actually heard that song - but we&apos;re sure Blunt will play it this week at his Webster Hall shows (with the Boy Least Likely To). The shows are sold out, so as an alternative we offer you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.myspace.com/areweapons">A.R.E. Weapons</a> at Don Hill&apos;s Tuesday night. Heh, just kidding, we wouldn&apos;t suggest that. </p>

<p>This Thursday bring your ear plugs to the Cake Shop for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.craigwedren.com/">Craig Wedren</a> (ex-Shudder to Think, former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.gothamist.com/interview/archives/2004/08/13/craig_wedren_musician.php">Gothamist interviewee</a>), Don Zientara and Joe Lally (Fugazi). If you prefer free beer over a layered cake of rock then head to Fat Baby for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://MyOpenBar.com/">MyOpenBar.com</a>&apos;s party. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.thisisivyleague.com/">Ivy League</a>, among others, will be playing - and there&apos;s free beer at 9:30. </p>

<p>If you missed out on tickets for the Silver Jews show on Friday, there are alternatives. Don&apos;t you fret. You can head to Northsix for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.myspace.com/rispaulric">Ris Paul Ric</a> (ex-Q and Not U) - if his solo stuff is as good as his old bands, then this show will be one you don&apos;t want to miss. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.stereolab.co.uk/">Stereolab</a> is also in town that night, playing Town Hall, and tickets still appear to be on sale. So if you like their spaced out pop, then go to this show - Town Hall has perfect acoustics. </p>

<p>The Hook is hosting the No Fun Fest this Saturday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.wolfeyes.net/">Wolf Eyes</a> is playing, and since any band with the name Wolf in it tends to generate buzz by default - we&apos;re sure this will be a packed show. Check it out if you aren&apos;t swaying to the songs crafted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225013420/http://www.jennylewis.com/">Jenny Lewis</a> at Irving Plaza. </p>

<p>That&apos;s it for now kids, sorry to be brief, but we&apos;ve got to pack for Austin! </p>
