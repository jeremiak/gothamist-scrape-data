Amongst them are CBS CEO Les Moonves&apos;s son (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406140329/http://www.myspace.com/chieftheband">Chief</a>), Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbin&apos;s son (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406140329/http://www.myspace.com/thetangentsnyc">The Tangents</a>), Michael Keaton&apos;s son (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406140329/http://www.myspace.com/thehatchmusic">The Hatch</a>), Jann Wenner&apos;s son (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406140329/http://www.myspace.com/theellisunit">The Ellis Unit</a>), Ellen Barkin and Gabriel Byrne&apos;s son (also in the Ellis Unit), and...you get the picture.</p>

<p>Susan Sarandon, who makes an attempt at attending all of her son&apos;s shows (apparently they&apos;re often at Bowery Poetry Club), told W about the soccer mom vibe at shows, saying that &#x201C;all the mothers are really close. I think it&#x2019;s a great outlet.&quot;</p>

<p>Will Jann Wenner&apos;s son ever make it onto the cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em>? Probably not; Zach Waldman, booker at Pianos, says the almost-famous bands aren&apos;t getting any special favors. W reports that &quot;he booked Moonves&#x2019;s band there a few times this year based on talent alone. The same goes for a month long residency last year that he gave the Hatch, a band fronted by Michael Keaton&#x2019;s 25-year-old son, Sean Douglas.&quot; Douglas also tries to <em>keep it real</em> by living in a barely furnished pad in Bushwick, just like his fellow struggling musicians. </p>
