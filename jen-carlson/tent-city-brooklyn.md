For $100 each per month the men get their own 5-by-8 plot of land where they&apos;ve set up tents. They say it&apos;s not only financially practical, but it&apos;s a &quot;badass thing to do.&quot; Keeping their expensive belongings (aside from the Tempurpedic mattresses) in a hallway in the 2-bedroom apartment which houses six others, they say &quot;the most challenging aspect of their living situation is not sleeping outside as much as sharing a single shower among nine people.&quot; Overall they seem to be enjoying the adventure, even if the rain can be a downer at times. Note to outdoorsy ladies: they&apos;re single! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604044842/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/09/boat_1.php">Houseboat living</a>, tent living...what will these crazy kids think of next? And will we all be knocking on their tent flaps when the economy finishes imploding?</p>
