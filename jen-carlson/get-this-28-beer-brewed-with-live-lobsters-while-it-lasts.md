<p>Obviously if a beer has lobster in it, it&apos;s going to be more expensive. </p>

<p><em>Should</em> a beer have lobster in it? Probably not? At least not without butter. Beer with lobster in it exists, though, and it will cost you anywhere from $18 to $32, while it lasts. Whether or not Harry here knows it, $28 for 16.9 oz. of lobster beer is a pretty fair price&#x2014;other bars in New York sell that amount for $35.</p>

<p>The beer is Oxbow&apos;s Saison Dell&apos;Aragosta Saison, which is brewed with LIVE Maine lobster. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184950/http://modernfarmer.com/2015/07/lobster-infused-beer-oxbow-brewing/">Modern Farmer</a>, this is how the magic happens:</p>

<blockquote>The ale made by boiling whole Maine lobsters in &#x201C;sweet wort,&#x201D; a mixture of water, malt and grain, made before adding the hops. After the lobsters are cooked, they&#x2019;re hauled out of the sweet wort. After the crustaceans are picked clean, their shells, which still retain a great deal of lobster flavor, are added back to the sweet wort, along with some Maine sea salt. After a bit more time, the shells are removed, hops are added and brewing proceeds as usual. The beer itself is a saison, a Belgian-style pale ale that&#x2019;s made in the winter and drunk in the summer.</blockquote>
