<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223025124/http://www.bicyclefilmfestival.com/dev/index.html">The Bicycle Film Festival</a> is back for it&apos;s fifth year of celebrating bikes (and the lifestyle of those upon them) through art, film, music and performance. The Opening Night Biker Party is tonight and features a live performance by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223025124/http://www.blonde-redhead.com/ ">Blonde Redhead</a>(!), as well as the opening of the &quot;Street&quot; art exhibit. <br>
Details: Tonight // 6pm // Courthouse Gallery [32 Second Avenue at 2nd]. </p>

<p>The first night of films also starts tonight. Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223025124/http://www.bicyclefilmfestival.com/dev/schedule.html">full schedule</a> here. We&apos;d like to catch <em>Still We Ride</em>, the 40 minute short film about Critical Mass focusing on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223025124/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/08/28/bike_protest_takes_to_the_streets.php">264 people that were arrested</a> prior to the RNC on charges of disorderly conduct and parading without a permit. The August crackdown in NYC was the beginning of an ongoing effort to supress free assembly for group rides. The monthly cycle of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223025124/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/05/01/critical_mass_riders_arrested_again.php">arrests and bicycle seizures</a> has forced the bike community into a legal battle with the city and politicized the very act of riding a bike.
