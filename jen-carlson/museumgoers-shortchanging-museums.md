                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0309MUSEUMTIX.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102165214im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0309MUSEUMTIX.jpg" width="145" height="80" class="image-right"> </span>With the Met Museum announcing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102165214/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/13/met.php">series of layoffs</a>, it&apos;s not surprising to hear that visitors of the establishment aren&apos;t paying the full recommended admission fee. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102165214/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03162009/news/regionalnews/price_less_works_of_art_159743.htm">The NY Post</a> reports that folks aren&apos;t willing to fork over the dough during the tough economic times, and many are just giving $1 (of the suggested $20) for their visit. For the Met and other NYC museums that have long shunned a set admission price, there&apos;s probably nothing they can do if they don&apos;t want to see a decrease in visitors. One recently laid off art lover told the paper, &quot;If they didn&apos;t do it, I&apos;m not sure I would come. I really appreciate that they allow me to pay on a sliding scale.&quot; There is one museum that hasn&apos;t taken a hit yet, the Museum of Natural History is still getting their $15 suggested price from visitors. A spokesman confirmed, &quot;For the time being...people are paying the suggested donation.&quot; Survival of the fittest?</p>
