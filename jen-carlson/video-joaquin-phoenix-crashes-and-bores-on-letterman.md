										<p>Actor and possible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175257/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/12/2489610.htm?section=entertainment">future rap superstar</a> Joaquin Phoenix took a seat across from David Letterman last night (to &quot;promote&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175257/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1103275/"><em>Two Lovers</em></a>), finally pushing Farrah Fawcett out of the top slot for all time most incoherent interview subject (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175257/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUmojv8Ui9g">Farrah video</a>!). Incase you missed it, here&apos;s the five minutes of teeth pulling:</p>

<p>Viewers are now left questioning the appearance&#x2014;is Phoenix trying to channel Andy Kaufman, or is he battling a substance abuse problem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175257/http://www.katu.com/entertainment/3627786.html">again</a>? Either way, only time will tell if he can rise from the ashes left on the Late Show studio floor. He promised to come back to perform a song, if invited&#x2014;and hopefully he&apos;ll study up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175257/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47Xl4A98OU">how Andy did it</a> before taking the mic.</p>
