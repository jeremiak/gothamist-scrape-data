<p>Approximately 365 times a year Jared Leto proves to us that his musical career should have ended when Frozen Embryos broke up. This time around he has decided to give his <em>very timely</em> critique of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510142647/http://gothamist.com/tags/taylorswift">Taylor Swift</a> and her album <em>1989</em>, which was released over one year ago. He didn&apos;t really &quot;decide&quot; to do this publicly, so much as TMZ has obtained video of him doing this, but sometimes it&apos;s hard to even tell where TMZ ends and Jared Leto begins. What we do know is that there is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510142647/http://www.tmz.com/2015/12/07/jared-leto-taylor-swift/">video on TMZ</a> showing Jared Leto listening to <em>1989</em> with one of his 30 Seconds to Mars bandmates, apparently for the first time, and saying the following: </p>

<ul><li>On &quot;Welcome to New York&quot;: &quot;Oh I don&apos;t like this at all, next...&quot;
</li><li>On &quot;Blank Space&quot;: &quot;Starbucks lovers?&quot;
</li><li>On all of it: &quot;I mean fuck her, I don&apos;t give a fuck about her.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>The two were allegedly trying to get some inspiration for their own album, which they are likely trying to promote by leaking this &quot;controversial footage&quot;?</p>

<p>Anyway, here is the last time Leto was relevant in the music world.</p>
