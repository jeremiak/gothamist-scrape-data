                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="barcadecemetery.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090144im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/barcadecemetery.jpg" width="350" height="249" class="image-left"> </span>Well this is positively Poltergeisty: Williamsburg arcade game/beer haven, Barcade, was built on a cemetery! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090144/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=779">ScoutingNY</a> researched the the area&apos;s history a little while ago &#x2014; after spotting the burial ground on an 1849 map of Brooklyn &#x2014; and we&apos;re here to resurrect the haunted history!</p>

<p>The cemetery was known as the Old Methodist Burying Ground which serviced the Attorney Street Methodist Church and the First Methodist Protestant Church of Williamsburg. When the church closed in 1856, the bodies were allegedly moved to Cyprus Hills Cemetery, but the Scout wonders if a few bodies may remain.</p>

<p>We asked the owner of Barcade, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090144/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/08/paul_kermizian.php">Paul Kermizian</a>, if he&apos;s seen anything supernatural; he told us, &quot;The only ghosts we&apos;ve seen have been in our Ms Pac Man game!&quot;</p>
