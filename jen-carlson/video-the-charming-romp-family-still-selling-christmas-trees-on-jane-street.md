<p>In 2010 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151104022134/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/07/the_view_from_the_streets_3_henry_r.php#photo-1">we met the Romps</a>, a charming family from Vermont who come down one month out of every year to sell Christmas trees in Greenwich Village. The family has expert tree man Billy at its core (he&apos;s got a great Jazzy Beatnick Santa look), and young Henry will deliver your purchase in his red Porsche. Meanwhile, mom Patti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151104022134/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/nyregion/14treepeople.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">has <em>branch</em>ed off</a> and is selling trees with son Tim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151104022134/http://www.yelp.com/biz/patti-romps-christmas-trees-new-york">on Montague Street</a> in Brooklyn Heights.</p>

<p>Lee Leshen filmed the family at their Jane Street location recently (Henry got a haircut!) and tells us he met Billy Romp &quot;after I read his book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151104022134/http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Jane-Street-Paperback-Urbanska/dp/B00EB0NLGK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387819839&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=billy+romp"><em>Christmas on Jane Street</em></a>, about five years ago.  As soon as I finished, I needed to experience this magic for myself, so I ran out the door and sprinted to Jane and 8th to meet Billy for the first time on Christmas Eve just before he rolled out in his camper with his family back to Vermont. Billy and I became fast friends and I decided to pick up a camera (first time since about 1997!) to showcase his stand, and how he makes his corner into a little magical Christmas Tree village, one month out of the year.&quot;</p>

<p>Meet the Romps, again or for the first time... and you&apos;ve still got time for a last minute impulse tree purchase!</p>
