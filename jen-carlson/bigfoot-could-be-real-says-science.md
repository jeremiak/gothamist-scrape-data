<span class="photo_caption">This means more (and more realistic) Bigfoot buddy comedies!</span></p>

<p>If Aaron Sorkin didn&apos;t convince you that Bigfoot was real during the first season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912064603/http://gothamist.com/tags/thenewsroom"><em>The Newsroom</em></a>, perhaps a new DNA finding will. After all, as Dev Patel&apos;s character pointed out on that show, even &quot;pandas were thought to be a myth until 1869.&quot;</p>

<p>But back to REALITY, a team of scientists (experts in genetics, forensics, imaging and pathology) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912064603/http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2012/11/prweb10166775.htm">have verified</a> that their 5-year long DNA study &quot;confirms the existence of a novel hominin hybrid species, commonly called &apos;Bigfoot&apos; or &apos;Sasquatch,&apos; living in North America.&quot; While the study is still under peer review, they believe that the Sasquatch is a &quot;human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago as a hybrid cross of modern Homo sapiens with an unknown primate species.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Melba S. Ketchum, who headed up the study, says, &quot;Our study has sequenced 20 whole mitochondrial genomes and utilized next generation sequencing to obtain 3 whole nuclear genomes from purported Sasquatch samples. The genome sequencing shows that Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens, but Sasquatch nuDNA is a novel, unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate species. Our data indicate that the North American Sasquatch is a hybrid species, the result of males of an unknown hominin species crossing with female Homo sapiens.&quot; If you can translate any of that, please do so in the comments. </p>

<p>And while NY State <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912064603/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/21/ny_state_claims_theres_no_bigfoot_s.php">refuses to ban bigfoot hunting</a> (or believe a bigfoot could exist), Ketchum declares: &quot;Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a &#x2018;license&#x2019; to hunt, trap, or kill them.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, as Neil Gaiman put it, &quot;I do not care if this is true or not. It makes the world a cooler place &amp; it delights me.&quot;</p>
