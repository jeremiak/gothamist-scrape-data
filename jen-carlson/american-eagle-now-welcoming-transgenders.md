Crew for discriminating against transgenders, after testing a number of retailers. Oddly, American Eagle wasn&apos;t on the list of stores they sent us at the time, but today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162109/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2010/05/12/2010-05-12_transgenders_win_discriminmation_tiff_with_american_eagle_outfitters_.html">the Daily News</a> reports that the organization has had a hand in impacting change at the retailer.<p></p>

<p>Through their findings, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has now forced the company to make changes, and they&apos;ve signed a settlement deal promising to hold to them. Most notably, a rule that banned men from wearing women&apos;s clothing and women from dressing like a man has now been erased from their employee handbook. </p>

<p>As for American Eagle, they said in a statement that agreeing to the settlement does not mean they are admitting to the findings the group presented to Cuomo; a rep said, &quot;We wholeheartedly believe that transgender individuals should be treated equally.&quot; A member of Make The Road NY told the paper, &quot;This shows me that there&apos;s faith and hope. There might be a domino effect, that&apos;s what I&apos;m hoping for.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the organization for an update on J. Crew (as well as other stores they found instances of discrimination at), and will update when we hear back.</p>
