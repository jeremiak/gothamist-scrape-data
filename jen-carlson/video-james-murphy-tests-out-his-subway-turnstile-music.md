<p>A couple of years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211212/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/james_murphy_has_big_plans_for_nyc.php">James Murphy proposed</a> that we get rid of that high-pitched tone that sounds off whenever a MetroCard is swiped through a subway turnstile, and replace it with something more pleasant sounding. Turns out this was more than just a fleeting suggestion&#x2014;Murphy started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211212/http://www.subwaysymphony.org/">a website</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211212/http://www.subwaysymphony.org/petition/">petition</a> to help make this &quot;subway symphony&quot; a reality. He explains that &quot;with the imminent change announced by the MTA from the MetroCard to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211212/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/farewell_metrocard_mta_plans_to_kil.php">a tap and ride system</a>, i feel the time is right to get some help with my little idea.&quot;</p>

<p>Acknowledging there are bigger problems in New York than this &quot;dissonant rubbing-styrofoam-on-glass squeak&quot; that the turnstiles make, Murphy goes on the explain that the solution would be an inexpensive one.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;What i propose to do is to create a series of 3 to 5 note sequences, all unique, one for each station in the subway system.  These sequences will be part of an intersecting larger piece of music, which would run from station to station, and cross one another as, say, the 4, 5, 6 line (one musical piece) intersects with the L, N, R, Q and W (another musical piece) at Union Square.  At each turnstile in Union Square, as you tap your new tap and ride card, a pleasant bell tone will sound, in one of a set of possible notes, all related to that station&apos;s note sequence.  The effect would be that at the busiest times, like rush hour, what was once cacophony would now be music.  

<p>It&apos;s financially and technically a pretty simple project, but over the past long while i&apos;ve found that this doesn&apos;t mean it will be easy to make happen.  The city has big things to deal with, and the MTA is busy getting me an millions of other New Yorkers to work and school every day.  Still, someone&apos;s going to make a chip that beeps on the next system&#x2026; that&apos;s a given.  All I&apos;m asking for is the chance to help make that beep something memorable.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>He previewed this idea in a video for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211212/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303973704579352971265881570">the Wall Street Journal</a>&#x2014;listen below:</p>

<p>Years ago the MTA suggested to us that, &quot;while the idea sounds good... Mr. Murphy should consider auditioning for our Music Under New York program.&quot; But maybe they&apos;ve <em>changed their tune</em>? Not quite. The MTA&apos;s Adam Lisberg told us this morning, &quot;It&#x2019;s a very cool idea. But given the cost, the inconvenience to our customers of taking turnstiles out of service, the questions about how this would affect visually impaired customers who need the tones, and the staff time that would be diverted from all the other projects they could be working on... I just don&#x2019;t see it happening.&quot;</p>
