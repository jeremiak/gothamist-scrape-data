										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="bettydraperpigeons.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911035355im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/bettydraperpigeons.jpg" width="365" height="251" class="image-right"> </span>Yesterday a young lady from Greenpoint, Brooklyn&#x2014;Quiana Stokes&#x2014;was nearly burned at the cyber-stake after publishing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911035355/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/22/stay_at_home_significant_others.php">some mid-century tips</a> on how to treat the hardworking man that is supporting you. What read like Betty Draper fan fiction was actually non-fiction, and presumably an accurate account of how Stokes&apos;s daily routine plays out. Now an Illinois native&#x2014;Megan Joy&#x2014;who has a blog called Stay At Home Girlfriend (<em>it&apos;s a thing</em>!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911035355/http://stayathomegirlfriend.blogspot.com/2011/02/feminism-schmeminism.html">has responded</a> in a post titled: feminism schmeminism. While her response is a little bit more modern-minded and less &quot;always be ready for sex even when you don&apos;t want it&quot;... there&apos;s also this:</p>

<blockquote><strong>I guess my main point is that I feel like women these days have done themselves a bit of a disservice by being SO focused on being independent and liberated from the traditional roles we once held.</strong>  In my ideal world I would be totally happy as a stay at home wife and mom for a few years. But I feel like that&apos;s some sort of shameful thing in our society now. 

<p>If you&apos;re the type of woman who&apos;s super driven to be out there in the workforce and to be a high roller [ed. note: high roller?!], then great.  But don&apos;t push your agenda on those of us who don&apos;t mind making other people happy once in a while. So here&apos;s to Quiana Stokes and her happiness as she stays at home and focuses on pleasing her man.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Are these women headed toward repressed anger and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911035355/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wGCjMYB1Kk">pigeon shooting</a>?</p>
