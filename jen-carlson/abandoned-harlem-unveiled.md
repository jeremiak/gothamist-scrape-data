</div></div>					<p>Our very own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406165438/http://bluejake.com/">Jake Dobkin</a> braved some disintegrating buildings in Harlem this past weekend. Both the ballroom (in the first photo) and the school (shown in all other photos) are located in Central Harlem about 10 blocks apart from each other, and are clearly abandoned now. He notes of the former: &quot;This building looked like it had been empty for twenty years. Trees were growing out of the floors and poking out of dozens of holes in the roof. All the windows were gone, and the floors that weren&apos;t covered with snow were thick with dust and the skeletons of dead pigeons. There wasn&apos;t any evidence of human habitation-- no footprints, homeless encampments, or graffiti.&quot;</p>
