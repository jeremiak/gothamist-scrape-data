<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160225115610/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2008/03/councilman_goes.php">The Village Voice</a> reports that one Queens Councilman, Hiram Monserrate, is ready for that to change. Monserrate wants us to officially stake claim on the &quot;Gotham City&quot; title, and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160225115610/http://webdocs.nyccouncil.info/textfiles/Res%201285-2008.htm?CFID=691015&amp;CFTOKEN=23691022">pushing the City Council</a> to designate it as our chief nickname (preferably before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160225115610/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/19/video_of_the_da_140.php"><em>The Dark Knight</em></a> is released this summer). He says, &#x201C;I see that as a marketing tool, &#x2018;Come visit the real Gotham City,&#x2019; taking advantage of this movie which will be one of those gate-breaking, record-selling movies like it always is.&#x201D; </p>

<p>While the Gotham we know from Batman is corrupt and gritty, Monserrate says, &#x201C;When we talk about Gotham we talk about tremendous, tremendous nightlife, restaurants, lounges, clubs and cafes, frappuccinos...&quot;. Pretty sure Batman was never spotted sipping a Starbucks frappuccino (though perhaps Bruce Wayne could be imagined in such a scenario). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160225115610/http://www.barrypopik.com/">Barry Popik</a> points out that Harlem&apos;s 1934 &quot;Big Apple&quot; night club&apos;s iconic sign was never landmarked, and instead destroyed in 2006 in order to put up a Popeye&apos;s fast food restaurant. Yet Monserrate says our Gotham City is all about &quot;the rich architecture,&quot; something that Batman&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160225115610/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City#Name_and_New_York_City_connection">Gotham was inspired by</a>; hopefully there will be some left by the time we get the official title. </p>
