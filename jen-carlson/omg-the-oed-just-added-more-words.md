<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="jamesmurrayoed.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116135809im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jamesmurrayoed.jpg" width="365" height="341"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">The OED&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116135809/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murray_%28lexicographer%29">James Murray</a></span></i></div> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116135809/http://gothamist.com/tags/miltonglaser">Milton Glaser</a> would be so proud. The designer of the &quot;I &#x2665; NY&quot; logo has had his work on bumper stickers and t-shirts, but now the &#x2665; symbol at the center of it has made its way into the Oxford English Dictionary. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116135809/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1369420/OED-grows-heart-graphic-symbol-love-added-latest-edition-dictionary.html#ixzz1HXrrFms3">the Daily Mail</a>, the &#x2665; symbol will be found will be found alongside the word &quot;heart&quot; and listed as a verb, meaning &quot;to love.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Joining the symbol&#x2014;and the other 600,000 words already in the dictionary&#x2014;will be the words Muffin Top, OMG, Dotbomb, Ego Surfing, and Banh Mi. The Philological Society&#x2014;which issued a grand statement of purpose in 1857, prior to the First Edition being published 22 year later&#x2014;is probably rolling in its collective grave.</p>

<p>The resource has been going through an updating process since 1989, when the Second Edition was published... when they&apos;re done will it read like a murder mystery revolving around the death of the English language? (Spoiler: the Internet did it!)</p>
