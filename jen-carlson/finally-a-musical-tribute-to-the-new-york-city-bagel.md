<p>Now that we&apos;ve heard this tribute&#x2014;titled &quot;Cream Cheese, Butter, Jelly&quot;&#x2014;it&apos;s hard to imagine a world in which no anthem to the New York City bagel exists, but that world was one we were living in not long ago. The below song (which seems to have been released around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403055128/http://www.hiphoppress.com/2010/05/nsr-cream-cheese-butter-jelly-official-music-video">2010</a> but is now getting some new life) comes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403055128/https://twitter.com/iamnsr">Noah Souder-Russo</a>, who praises the city&apos;s bagels&#x2014;specifically Lenny&apos;s on 98th Street&#x2014;giving nods to sesame, to poppy, to everything, to cinnamon raisin... to any bagel worth its weight in dough. With lyrics like: &quot;My spread game proper, dead aim onto my bagel&quot;... how can you <em>not</em> click play?</p>
