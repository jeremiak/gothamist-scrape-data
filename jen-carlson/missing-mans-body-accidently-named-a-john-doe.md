Back in 2002 a 27-year-old named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194036/http://www.richardmassey.com/blogger.html">Richard Massey</a> disappeared in New York. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194036/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/tragic_body_id_bungle_rTVwpPCbuEZXUvJMk0YlAI">the NY Post</a>, the computer programmer had just moved here from England, reportedly started acting &quot;bizarrely&quot; and was taken to St. Vincent&apos;s Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194036/http://www.websleuths.com/forums/showthread.php?t=69634">Allegedly</a>, in prior weeks, he was scared someone was going to hurt him. He checked himself out of the hospital on December 19th, and was never seen again. </p>

<p>Three months later his body was found floating in the East River, but the ME&apos;s office didn&apos;t inform his family, who had put out a search for him. Instead, they buried his body at a potter&apos;s field on Hart Island, and didn&apos;t inform Massey&apos;s family until October 2008. For some reason, upon discovering his body he was marked a John Doe &#x2014; despite there being a missing persons report filed.</p>

<p>The family has now filed a lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages and accusing the city, police and medical examiners of negligence. Their lawyer states, &quot;There was a breakdown in communication between the ME and the NYPD.&quot; Indeed.</p>
