<p>This weekend we looked at an old traffic congestion solution that involved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730030306/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/16/1924_traffic_congestion_solution_dr.php">draining the East River</a> in 1924. Turns out that about 10 years later, a similar plan to pave over the Hudson River was proposed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730030306/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/04/14/filling-in-the-hudson-to-rebuild-new-york/?Qwd=./ModernMechanix/3-1934/filling_hudson&amp;Qif=filling_hudson_0.jpg&amp;Qiv=thumbs&amp;Qis=XL#qdig">Modern Mechanix</a> has an article detailing the $1 billion project, which would have involved plugging up the Hudson at both ends of Manhattan and diverting the water into the Harlem River &quot;so that it might flow out into the East River and down to the Atlantic Ocean.&quot; The drained portion would be filled, connecting the Island of Manhattan with... New Jersey!</p>

<p>The ten square miles of land would provide for thousands of additional buildings, as well as roadways that would relieve traffic congestion. With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730030306/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/20/2level_streets.php">subterranean tubes and tunnels</a> constructed, a secondary fill would then &quot;bring the level up to within twenty-five feet of the Manhattan street level. Upon this level would rest the foundations and basements of the buildings that would make up the new city above.&quot; It was noted that the underground levels would also &quot;serve as a great military defense against gas attack in case of war, for in it would be room for practically the entire population of the city.&quot;</p>
