										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phprEIrDWPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011224152im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phprEIrDWPM.jpg" width="240" height="275" class="image-left"> </span>Infamous graffiti gal Danielle Bremner (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011224152/http://gothamist.com/tags/utah">aka UTAH</a>) is a free woman after serving out 6 months on Rikers and 6 months in a Boston facility. She was busted after a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-esque 3-month tagging spree in Europe with her boyfriend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011224152/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/21/tagging_couple_arrested.php">in 2008</a>. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old admits to tagging surfaces worldwide for the past 10 years, and now she&apos;s taggin&apos; up the world wide web! (Sorry.) Bremner was recently interviewed over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011224152/http://blogue.us/2010/02/10/utah-the-interview/">Blogue</a>, where she announced her new project: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011224152/http://www.utahoner.com/">a blog</a>. Her first post last month simply read: &quot;I&#x2019;m a free bitch baby!!!&quot;</p>

<p>In the interview she discussed what that time behind bars was like, saying, &quot;It&#x2019;s just the biggest waste of time ever. It&#x2019;s like hitting a giant pause button on your life ... It wasn&#x2019;t cliquey like how its portrayed in movies or television dramas. Basically, its a bunch of grown women hanging out all day in their pajamas, reading Cosmo and watching <em>Law &amp; Order SVU</em>.&quot; </p>

<p>Aside from watching television, she says she also slept a lot, learned how to make a lighter out of a double A battery and a piece of wire... and has no regrets.</p>
