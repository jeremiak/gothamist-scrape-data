title: Colbert On Pizza Rat: "It's Really Not That Big Of A Deal"
---

	
										<p>It&apos;s Day 3 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160202145943/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">#PizzaRat Fever</a> here on the Land of Make Believe that is the Internet, which means we are now in the midst of the Backlash Phase. Let Stephen Colbert ease you in with his indifferent attitude towards the viral star of yesteryear. &quot;It&apos;s Really Not That Big Of A Deal,&quot; Colbert shrugged from behind his desk last night, noting that the video &quot;shocked the tourists, but for those of us living in New York&quot; we&apos;re used to this. &quot;Pizza Rat get over yourself, you&apos;re not that special.&quot; Amen. </p>
