<p>Five long years ago we asked Blue Marble Ice Cream owners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501052812/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/07/jennie_and_alexis_blue_marble_ice_c.php">Jennie and Alexis</a> if they would ever make &quot;burnt sugar&quot; flavored ice cream, which is <em>everywhere</em> in Boston, but nowhere to be found in New York City. Alexis told us at the time, &quot;Burnt sugar is one of my favorite flavors of all time! I used to live in Boston and would make regular treks across the Charles to Christina&apos;s (in Cambridge) for it. They made a great burnt sugar. We have definitely considered it, among other great flavor ideas, and hope to have it up on the menu someday soon.&quot; Well the time has come. The shop just introduced the flavor to their menu, and we tried it yesterday. Here were the reactions heard around Gothamist HQ:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="icecreamscoop0513.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501052812im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/icecreamscoop0513.jpg" width="325" height="340" class="image-right"> </span>&quot;Overwhelming at first, but definitely reminds one of ice cream&apos;s essential elements, not buried beneath mounds of sugar. Something that feels home-made about it, like something your fictional midwestern grandmother whipped up.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501052812/https://twitter.com/MaxRivlinNadler">Max Rivlin-Nadler</a></p>

<p>&quot;Upon first taste may seem unpleasant, aggressive&#x2014;you just have to keep eating and your tastebuds will acclimate and you will enjoy it very much. Doesn&apos;t exactly taste burnt to me, lightly charred maybe! And, like all ice cream, it needed rainbow sprinkles.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501052812/https://twitter.com/marc_yearsley">Marc Yearsley</a></p>

<p>&quot;Burnt sugar tasted bitter at first, which was a bit of a shock. But the ice cream&apos;s consistency kept a good balance between creamy and grainy, and after a while the taste grew on me.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501052812/https://twitter.com/bfishbfish">Rebecca Fishbein</a></p>

<p>&quot;Definitely tastes authentically burnt! Reminds me of a super strong espresso.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501052812/https://twitter.com/jenchung">Jen Chung</a></p>

<p>&quot;Creme brulee! But like, when you get one with a sort of overburnt edge and that bite only tastes awesome when you pair it with a giant scoop of the custard itself. And I thought it tasted pretty awesome with Kahlua and would probably enjoy it in a mudslide, because they are overly sweet.&quot; &#x2014; Monica Schmelzer</p>

<p>There you have it&#x2014;even if you don&apos;t like the first bite, you will be <em>in love</em> by the 2nd or 3rd. Blue Marble has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501052812/http://www.bluemarbleicecream.com/find/scoop-shops/">a couple of scoop shops</a>, just call ahead to make sure they have burnt sugar before you head out&#x2014;they were nearly sold out when we picked some up yesterday.</p>
