	<p>Chrissy Amphlett, the frontwoman of &apos;90s band The Divinyls, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061415/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chrissy-amphlett-i-touch-myself-singer-dead-at-53-20130422">died at her home</a> in New York City yesterday at the age of 53.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, and her musician husband, Charley Drayton, said in a statement that she &quot;succumbed to the effects of breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, diseases she vigorously fought with exceptional bravery and dignity.&quot; He added, &quot;Chrissy&apos;s light burns so very brightly. Hers was a life of passion and creativity. She always lived it to the fullest. With her force of character and vocal strength, she paved the way for strong, sexy, outspoken women.&quot;</p>

<p>Amphlett&apos;s band released six albums between 1982 and 1986, but they were best known to the masses for their hit song &quot;I Touch Myself,&quot; which dominated the airwaves and MTV in the early 1990s. But Amphlett &quot;was an icon of Australian music,&quot; the AP notes&#x2014;and fellow Aussie Russell Crowe Tweeted this morning: &quot;Dear Chrissie, The last time I saw you was in the Botanic Gardens, loving life and reciting verse. That&apos;s how I&apos;ll remember you, your boy, R.&quot;</p>
