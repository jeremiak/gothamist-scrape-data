</div></div><p>These may all be familiar sights, but you&apos;ve probably never seen them like this before. Christopher Thomas&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215225342/http://www.stevenkasher.com/html/exhibinfo.asp?exnum=1070">New York Sleeps exhibit</a> opens tomorrow (running through January 9th) at the Steven Kasher Gallery. Thomas takes the distractions away from the city, removing those pesky crowds, giving everything an &quot;I Am Legend&quot; spin. Or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215225342/http://www.curators.de/en/artists/christopher-thomas">the foreword</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215225342/http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Sleeps-Christopher-Thomas/dp/3791342347">his book</a> reads: &quot;This is New York! Or are they dream worlds, chimeras, inventions, or perhaps testimony to a past era? Viewers are astonished, recognizing the places and getting lost in memories. A city of silence, beyond the turbulence of everyday life, a metropolis with no people, as if a spell had been cast on it: Grand Central Station, Fifth Avenue, the Flatiron Building, Katz&#x2019;s Restaurant, the Brooklyn Bridge&#x2014;familiar, but never seen this way before.&quot;</p>
