</div></div>					<p>Last Friday morning we were lucky enough to spend some time in the New York Public Library&apos;s main branch, which opened up in 1911, before the doors were unlocked to the public. Librarian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007083620/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/06/dave_smith_nypls_librarian_to_the_s.php">David Smith</a> and some of the other NYPL staff took us around on a tour of the massive structure, from the remains of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007083620/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET SCENES/Croton/croton.html">Croton Reservoir</a>, to the Allen Room (reserved for writers with book contracts) to the room where Charles Dickens&apos;s dead cat&apos;s paw resides (seriously), we saw it all! Well, except for the miles of books in the stacks that are housed under Bryant Park, that&apos;s top secret. Stay tuned for some interviews with more of the folks behind the books, and until then, we highly recommend you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007083620/http://www.support.nypl.org/">show some support</a> (or at least get your library card)!</p>
