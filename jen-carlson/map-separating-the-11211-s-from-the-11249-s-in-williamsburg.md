<p>Last week the USPS announced that parts of Williamsburg would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225717/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/02/williamsburg_residents_riled_up_ove.php">stripped of the hip 11211 zip code</a>, only to be given a less palindromic one: 11249. The USPS has now sent us (in the mail!) a map of the breakdown, pictured above, where a green line separates the old from the new. As you can see, the (let&apos;s face facts) ugly zip code is being given to residents who live between Bedford Avenue and the waterfront, meaning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225717/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/cue_tiny_violins_for_williamsburg_l.php"><em>another</em> nightmare</a> for luxury condo dwellers! They won&apos;t be getting their own new fancy post office, either.</p>

<p>The 11211 graffiti that&apos;s long been tagged on a storefront in the neighborhood just missed the cut-off, and will still be in the 11211 zone (<em>phew</em>)&#x2014;it&apos;s located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225717/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=141+Broadway+brooklyn&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62,New+York,+NY&amp;cid=0,0,6261619025113017276&amp;ll=40.708816,-73.961313&amp;spn=0.011093,0.032337&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.710379,-73.963563&amp;panoid=NCePjAqxzFF9M6g2_Lkppw&amp;cbp=12,17.02,,0,5.64">141 Broadway</a>. What side are you on?</p>
