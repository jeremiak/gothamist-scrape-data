<p>Brooklyn-bred folk legend Richie Havens passed away today at the age of 72. His reps at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105033236/http://www.therootsagency.com/artist-roster/richie-havens">The Roots Agency</a> made this statement: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Richie Havens was gifted with one of the most recognizable voices in popular music. His fiery, poignant, soulful singing style has remained unique and ageless since his historic appearance at Woodstock in 1969. For four decades, Havens used his music to convey passionate messages of brotherhood and personal freedom. Billboard Magazine writes, &apos;This acoustic soul giant truly seems to be getting more inspiring and graceful with age.&apos; 

<p>From Woodstock to The Isle of Wight to Glastonbury to the Fillmore Auditorium to Royal Albert Hall to Carnegie Hall, Richie played the most legendary music festivals that ever were, and most of the world&#x2019;s greatest concert venues. But even when performing in a Greenwich Village coffeehouse or a small club or regional theater, he was eternally grateful that people in any number turned up each time to hear him sing. More than anything, he feels incredibly blessed to have met so many of you along the way.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Havens is universally known for many things, but perhaps his most indelible performance was opening up Woodstock in 1969.</p>

<p>There aren&apos;t many details now on Havens&apos;s death, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131105033236/http://www.jambase.com/Articles/118431/Richie-Havens-Dies-at-Age-72">Jambase</a> notes that he &quot;toured and recorded for decades until complications from kidney surgery left him unable to tour after 45 years in 2012.&quot; A public memorial will be planned.</p>

<p>Here he is performing &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; in 2009: </p>
