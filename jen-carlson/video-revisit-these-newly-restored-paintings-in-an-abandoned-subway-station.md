<p>In 1980, a moving image installation called the Masstransiscope was installed in the abandoned Myrtle Avenue subway station in Brooklyn. Since then it&apos;s been seen by millions of commuters for over 30 years. The piece, made of 228 hand-painted panels courtesy of artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112543/http://www.bboptics.com/masstransiscope.html">Bill Brand</a>, was based on the principle of the Zoetrope, a 19th century optical toy. When you pass by it in the subway (which you can do on the Manhattan-bound B and Q trains, just past the DeKalb Avenue stop) it resembles a moving picture. We revisited the piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112543/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/19/video_of_the_day_the_restored_masst.php">in 2008</a> when it was restored, which just happened again this year&#x2014;here&apos;s Brand discussing the latest restoration:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s what a great collection of news clips showing what straphangers thought about it when it debuted in 1980:</p>
