<p>Important Simpsons Update: From now until forever, Nitehawk Cinema will be hosting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152017/http://nitehawkhatched.com/simpsons-club/">Monday night Simpsons Club</a>, from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. They declare:</p><blockquote>&quot;From hereon in, Monday nights will become an impromptu treehouse of Simpsons adoration. We will be screening every episode of the greatest televised sitcom from the beginning, along with all 48 Tracey Ullman shorts, DVD extras, ads from the original air dates spliced into episodes and whatever other bits of nerdery we can dig up to give this beloved pop culture institution a renewed sense of history and context.&quot;</blockquote>We&apos;d say this is the most comprehensive and all-encompassing Simpsons series ever, but there&apos;s no mention of Krusty burgers, doughnuts, Flaming Moe&apos;s, or Guatemalan Insanity Peppers. Worst club <em>EVER?</em><p></p>
