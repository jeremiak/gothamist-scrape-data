<p>Not so long ago, major music festivals struggled to succeed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/festival_fail.php">in the NYC area</a>, with many attempts lasting just one or two years. But with the success of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://gothamist.com/tags/governorsball">Governors Ball</a>, it looks like NYC is becoming attractive to festival organizers once again. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/exclusive-coachella-producers-eye-unisphere-music-fest-article-1.2379255">the Daily News</a>, &quot;Coachella could be coming to Queens.&quot; </p>

<p>That&apos;s not exactly true&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://laist.com/tags/coachella">Coachella</a> <em>organizers</em> AEG are eyeing Flushing Meadows Corona Park for a new festival, called (tentatively) Panorma. If deals with the city go through, the inaugural event could take place as early as next June. Two weeks after Governors Ball. And they&apos;re reportedly already booking headliners. RIP Governors Ball.</p>

<p>Tom Russell, of Governors Ball, told us today, &quot;New York City is big enough for two music festivals but the proposed timing of this sets up an unnecessary rivalry. We&apos;re a small, local promoter up against a big corporate machine. We know how those fights typically work out.&quot;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the AEG&apos;s Panorama festival could bring more attention to a park that has been left <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/27/what_is_to_be_done_with_the_new_yor.php">to deteriorate</a> over the years. This would be that area&apos;s biggest event since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://gothamist.com/tags/World&apos;sFair">the &apos;64/&apos;65 Worlds Fair</a>... and maybe AEG would spring to help rehabilitate some of the Fair&apos;s remains? We&apos;ve reached out to them for clarification on their plans, and the exact location they&apos;re considering, and will update when we know more.</p>

<p>AEG&apos;s previous dip into the festival waters here was back in 2008, when they held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://gothamist.com/tags/allpointswest">All Points West</a> in Liberty State Park, NJ. The fest ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032128/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/24/all_points_west_2.php">for two years</a>.</p>
