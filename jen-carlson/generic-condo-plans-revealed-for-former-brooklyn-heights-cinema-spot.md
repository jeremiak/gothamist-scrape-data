<p>Brooklyn Heights has been losing some of its most beloved businesses over this past year, namely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904084941/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/12/rip_brooklyn_heights_cinema.php">Brooklyn Heights Cinema</a>, which closed last August, and Siggy&apos;s, which shut its doors rather unexpectedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904084941/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/05/siggys_say_it_aint_so.php">earlier this year</a>. </p>

<p>The Cinema, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904084941/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/27/save_nycs_oldest_independent_cinema.php">white-knuckling</a> onto its Henry Street space for as long as it could, was a particularly great loss. That single-story white brick building, the small screens, the signage, the FONT! It looked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904084941/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/12/rip_brooklyn_heights_cinema.php">44 years old,</a> and that totally fit with the neighborhood, which is, after all, America&apos;s First Suburb. Anyway, it really tied the... community together.</p>

<p>So it&apos;s especially dispiriting to see that the most generic, ugly set of condos will seize its soul. While the cinema&apos;s bones will technically still be there, they will be unrecognizable.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904084941/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/06/17/finally_meet_the_condos_replacing_brooklyn_heights_cinema.php">Curbed sounds optimistic</a> about this beast, noting that the &quot;five-story apartment building proposed for 70 Henry Street earned approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission yesterday. Morris Adjmi, whose work is on the whole respectable, is designing; the LPC rejected rejected earlier iterations twice. Adjmi&apos;s revised plans preserves the exterior of the existing building&#x2014;in fact, it calls for the restoration of its original brick facade&#x2014;while splitting its interior into two stories and adding three more levels on top of it.&quot; </p>

<p>Apparently a few minor changes will be made to what you see here, like the roof railing won&apos;t be so shiny. Oh, well that changes <em>everything</em>.</p>
