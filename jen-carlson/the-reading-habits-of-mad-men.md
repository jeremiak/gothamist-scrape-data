The Battery Park City Library has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150151/http://twitter.com/#!/BatteryParkCity/status/27165034611">Tweeting links</a> to books that have been making cameos on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150151/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, from Frank O&apos;Hara&apos;s <em>Meditations in an Emergency</em> to <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> to F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s <em>Babylon Revisited</em>&#x2014;and now they&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150151/http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/09/13/mad-men-reading-list">added a photo gallery</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the books spotted in Don Draper&apos;s office have included, <em>The Hidden Persuaders</em> by Vance Packard, <em>The Lonely Crowd</em> by David Riesman, <em>The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America</em> by David Boorstin, and <em>The Hucksters</em> by Frederick Wakeman. And of course, there was the scandalous book <em>Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover</em>, which appeared in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150151/http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/episode3">season 3</a> when &quot;Joan returns a tattered copy to Marge, one of the switchboard ladies. The book, a 1928 novel that was banned for its explicit sex scenes and four-letter words, sparks Peggy&apos;s interest. With some prodding, she borrows it.&quot; (Ladies, you can apply for your library card <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150151/http://www.nypl.org/help/library-card">here</a>!)</p>
