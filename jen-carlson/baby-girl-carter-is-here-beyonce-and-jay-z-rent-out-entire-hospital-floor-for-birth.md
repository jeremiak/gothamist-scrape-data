										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="beyonce0112sm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727061710im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/beyonce0112sm.jpg" width="325" height="281" class="image-right"> </span>This weekend rumors were swirling that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727061710/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonc&#xE9;</a> had checked in to Lenox Hill Hospital on Friday night, under the name &quot;Ingrid Jackson,&quot; with husband Jay-Z by her side. And alas, it turns out the power couple was there for B&apos;s planned c-section, which took place sometime last night. So <em>finally</em>, after months of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727061710/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/beyonce_responds_to_stupid_fake_bab.php">fake bump rumors</a>, the couple has welcomed a baby girl into the world&#x2014;the same world she will likely take over one day. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140727061710/http://www.eonline.com/news/happy_bday_beyonceacute_jay-z_welcome/284730">E! News</a> reports that her name is Blue Ivy Carter, or at least &quot;that&apos;s what Jay-Z is telling pals.&quot;</p>

<p>The couple rented out the entire fourth floor of the hospital to create a private wing for themselves (to the tune of $1.3 million), so presumably any commoners giving labor at Lenox Hill this weekend were in tighter quarters. E! notes that &quot;after 11 p.m., even doctors and nurses were barred from entering the fourth floor, prompting one doc to complain that he had patients to see.&quot; The private wing presumably turned into party central last night, with people seen &quot;bringing bags of takeout and a dozen bottles of red wine onto the heavily guarded hospital wing.&quot;</p>

<p>While there may be some rumors leaking about the details of The Most Important Birth Of Our Time, don&apos;t expect to see any photos. The floor was guarded, with hospital staff forced to give up their phones upon checking in for their shifts, and even security cameras had tape placed over them.</p>
