<p><img alt="200709ehm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110025220im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/200709ehm.jpg" width="350" height="158" class="right">Barry Manilow, who is out promoting his <em>Greatest Songs of the Seventies</em>, has refused to share a stage with Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who was barely walking in the 70s. The crooner left a little message on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110025220/http://www.manilow.com/">his website</a> yesterday for his fans letting them know he wouldn&apos;t be on <em>The View</em> today, saying &quot;I had made a request that I be interviewed by Joy, Barbara or Whoopi, but not Elisabeth Hasselback.  Unfortunately, the show was not willing to accommodate this simple request so I bowed out. It&#x2019;s really too bad because I&apos;ve always been a big supporter of the show, but I cannot compromise my beliefs.&quot;</p>

<p>Manilow vs Hasselbeck, it&apos;s on! The reason for his request is that Manilow is a major Democratic fundraiser, and Hasselbeck is a conservative (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110025220/http://www.tmz.com/2007/09/17/barry-to-elisabeth-your-view-is-dangerous">as Manilow put it</a> &quot;dangerous and offensive&quot;). Clearly the producers of the show wanted to get a heated interview with the two, and when he refused -- they refused to accommodate him. Daytime television and easy listening have never been so edgy!</p>

<p>Last night on Barbara Walters&apos;s Sirius radio show, she and her producer Bill Geddie discussed the situation, which went something like this...</p>

<p><strong>BG:</strong> I wouldn&#x2019;t even be talking about this except that he called up TMZ. So, now, what are we going to do? Last Friday we got the word that he&#x2019;s very close to Rosie, and he doesn&#x2019;t want to appear.</p>

<p><strong>BW:</strong> Well also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110025220/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/25/rosie_odonnell_3.php">Elisabeth Hasselbeck is not an enemy of Rosie&#x2019;s</a>. None of us are. If Elisabeth disagrees with Rosie, and Rosie disagrees with Elisabeth&#x2026;.nobody is to my knowledge is taking sides. All I can think of is that wonderful song (Walters breaks into rendition of &#x2018;I Write the Songs That Make the Whole Sing&#x2019;&#x2026;adding her own lyrics) Provided They Happen to Be Liberals.&#x2019;</p>

<p><strong>BG:</strong> It got me thinking. You know, I&#x2019;ve never heard Jane Fonda say &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t sit with Elisabeth Hasselbeck.&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve never heard Susan Sarandon say that. If someone was conservative and said &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t sit with Joy Behar&#x2019; I&#x2019;d react the exact same way.  I don&#x2019;t understand this when this became an issue for him, and why would you go off and then call TMZ and make a big column item. Is it all about publicity? Is this all it is?</p>

<p>Interesting how a few lines on TMZ can get someone more publicity than a network television show these days. </p>
