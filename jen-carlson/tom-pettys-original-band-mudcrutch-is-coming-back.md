<p>If you&apos;ve ever watched that epic documentary on Tom Petty, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530065711/http://www.amazon.com/Tom-Petty-Heartbreakers-Runnin-Dream/dp/B003A3X24A/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458922683&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tom+petty"><em>Running Down A Dream</em></a>, you are familiar with Mudcrutch. The four hour cinematic dip into Petty&apos;s life begins in Gainesville, Florida, where the musician joins forces with Mike Campbell (one of the most important meetings in music history), Benmont Tench (a Schroeder-esque character on keys), Jim Lenehan, Tom Leadon, and Randall Marsh. </p>

<p>Regarding that name, in the documentary the band members explain: &quot;We picked this really terrible name: Mudcrutch... We all liked it because it sounded kind of dirty and decrepit.&quot;</p>

<p>That was 1971, and the band never really made it to the &apos;80s, thanks to Petty&apos;s success with the Heartbreakers (only Tench and Campbell made that crossover&#x2014;&quot;two of the best musicians in the world walked right into my life,&quot; Petty said of them). </p>

<p>While Mudcrutch released a couple of singles in the &apos;70s (they were signed in &apos;74 and moved to Los Angeles at the time), they didn&apos;t put out their first full length album until 2008, and now they&apos;re about to put out a second, entitled <em>2</em>, which will coincide with a tour. The album comes out on May 20th, and the tour kicks off in May (head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530065711/http://MudcrutchMusic.com/">MudcrutchMusic.com</a> for more). From today&apos;s press release:</p><blockquote>Mudcrutch announced their second album entitled &quot;2&quot; will be released by Reprise Records on May 20th. The album is the follow up to the band&apos;s 2008 eponymous debut which Rolling Stone called &quot;a country-rock instant classic&quot; in a rave four star review. The new album, produced by band members Tom Petty and Mike Campbell with Ryan Ulyate. <br>
 <br>
All members of Mudcrutch contribute songs on their new album &quot;2.&quot; The album includes seven originals written by Tom Petty, with band members Mike Campbell, Tom Leadon, Randall Marsh and Benmont Tench composing one each.<br>
 <br>
Mudcrutch has also announced their first national tour. Tom Petty (bass/vocals), Tom Leadon (guitar/vocals), Benmont Tench (keyboards/vocals), Mike Campbell (guitar/vocals), and Randall Marsh (drums/vocals) make up the band&apos;s current line up.</blockquote><p></p>
