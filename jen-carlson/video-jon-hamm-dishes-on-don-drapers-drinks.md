										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="draperdon0511.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165933im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/draperdon0511.jpg" width="300" height="198" class="image-right"> </span>Jon Hamm was on Conan last night, talking about poop-scooping etiquette, Jack McBrayer, and Donald Trump (who he says didn&apos;t take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165933/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/obama_takes_on_trump_at_white_house.php#photo-1">those jokes</a> at the White House Correspondents Dinner too well). </p>

<p>But what happens to Hamm when he&apos;s out at a bar? People think he drinks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165933/http://gothamist.com/tags/dondraper">Don Draper</a>. He told the host, &quot;I get sent over bourbon... in these tankers... which, human beings can&apos;t drink that much bourbon. I don&apos;t think they realize what I&apos;m drinking on the show is... not bourbon. It&apos;s tea, or water with food coloring in it.&quot; </p>

<p>If you run into him in real life and can&apos;t resist the urge to buy him a drink... Hamm goes with &quot;a nice frothy midori sour, usually. I feel the real men go for any drink that&apos;s in the neon family.&quot;</p>
