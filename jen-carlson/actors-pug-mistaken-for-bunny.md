title: Actor's Pug Mistaken for Bunny?

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_08_punny.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014555im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_08_punny.jpg" width="270" height="224" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s hard to win when you are accused by a 60-something-year-old couple of abusing their dog. But alas, that is the situation actor Gerard Butler is currently in. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014555/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/26/couple_claims_actor_attacked_dog_in.php">Yesterday</a> news came out that a greyhound belonging to the couple encountered Butler and his pug on the street. The pug was unleashed, and the greyhound was leashed. </p>

<p>The couple, Maria and Fred Vareckas, admit their dog growled upon the encounter, but say they had &quot;complete control&quot; the entire time. While Butler spent the evening at the vet getting his pug patched up, the couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014555/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08272009/news/regionalnews/harebrained_186692.htm">told the Post</a> that their greyhound &quot;didn&apos;t touch the dog.&quot; But if he did, Butler&apos;s friends say that the vet noted how such attacks were &quot;common when [greyhounds] retired because these dogs are trained on small animals,&quot; and it&apos;s possible because the pug looks like ... a &quot;fat bunny&quot;?</p>

<p>In the end, the couple maintains that Butler threw their dog against a fence, and Mrs. Vareckas told the paper, &quot;<strong>He&apos;s not a nice person. I want people to know he&apos;s an ass. I don&apos;t want anything from him. Maybe he could make a donation to Grateful Greyhounds</strong>,&quot; a charity where she and her husband both work.</p>
