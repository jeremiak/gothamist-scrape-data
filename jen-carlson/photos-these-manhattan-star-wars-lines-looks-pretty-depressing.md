										<p>Ah, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030907/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/1980s_star_wars_nyc_line.php">remember the &apos;80s</a>, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030907/http://gothamist.com/tags/starwars"><em>Star Wars</em></a> movies were released in May, a month that provides perfect weather for waiting on line? Well those days are over&#x2014;J.J. Abrams is in charge now, and you will wait in the cold December rain to see his work of cinematic art, <em>The Force Awake</em> UP SHEEPLE, they just want to sell you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030907/http://www.ibtimes.com/star-wars-mania-awakens-sales-force-here-are-movies-weirdest-brand-cross-promotions-2226511">some lipstick</a>. </p>

<p>These photos were taken around 2:30 p.m. today outside of the Regal Cinemas Union Square, where things looked pretty dismal. Our correspondent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030907/https://twitter.com/scoboco">Scott Lynch</a> told us, &quot;Unless you bought tickets for the all-day marathon, Regal is making people wait outside for the 7 p.m. show. A manager came out and tried to upsell the marathon&#x2014;the final two movies, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, plus admittance to <em>Force Awakens</em>&#x2014;for $50, but no one took the bait, not even to get out of the rain.&quot; The first guy on line got there at 10 a.m.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inside they&apos;re selling T-shirts and hoodies for $20 to $50.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Meanwhile, at the 86th Street Loews on the Upper East Side, a larger crowd of 110 is stationed outside. Correspondent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030907/https://twitter.com/scottheins">Scott Heins</a> tells us up there &quot;they&apos;re letting people seeing the 7 p.m. screening in at 5:30.&quot; The four people in the front of the line are in possession of tickets to the 7 p.m. AND the 10 p.m. screenings, because they are that stoked.</p>
