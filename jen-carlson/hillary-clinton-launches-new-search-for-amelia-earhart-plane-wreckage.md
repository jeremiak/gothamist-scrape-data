<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="earhart0312.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120321103812im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/earhart0312.jpeg" width="350" height="297" class="image-left"> </span>Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120321103812/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/03/186072.htm">is launching a new search</a> for Amelia Earhart&apos;s plane wreckage, as the 75th anniversary of the pilot&apos;s disappearance approaches. On July 2nd, 1937, Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared while flying from New Guinea to Howland Island, and searches at that time were fruitless. Since then, a number of conspiracy theories have been formed, including one from an episode of National Geographic&apos;s Undiscovered History in 2006, which claimed Earhart survived the flight, moved to New Jersey, changed her name, remarried and became Irene Craigmile Bolam.  </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120321103812/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/clinton-helps-launch-search-amelia-earhart-plane-article-1.1047419">the Daily News</a>, Clinton will meet with historians and scientists from The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery today, and together they will launch a new search in June for the wreckage of the plane off the remote island of Nikumaroro. The group believes Earhart and Noonan landed on the island and survived for a short time. Previous visits to the island have turned up artifacts that could have belonged to Earhart and Noonan, and now a U.S. official has stated that analysis of a contemporary photo of the island shows what could be the strut and wheel of the plane.</p>

<p>In a statement, the department noted that the expedition &quot;will underscore America&#x2019;s spirit of adventure and courage, as embodied by Amelia Earhart, and our commitment to seizing new opportunities for cooperation with Pacific neighbors founded on the United States&#x2019; long history of engagement in the Asia-Pacific region.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the last footage of Earhart and Noonan before their disappearance: </p>
