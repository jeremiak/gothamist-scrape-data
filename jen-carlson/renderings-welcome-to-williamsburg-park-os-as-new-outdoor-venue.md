<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142830/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/osa_looking_for_design_proposals_fo.php">Earlier this month</a> the Open Space Alliance was looking for design proposals for the 50 Kent space, which will now host the concerts that used to be held a few blocks over, on the Williamsburg Waterfront by The Edge (and at McCarren Park Pool before that). Now they&apos;ve started up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142830/https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsburgParkBK">a Facebook page</a>, and earlier today posted a few renderings of what the space will look like come summer. Needless to say, the neighbors complaining about the new location have lost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142830/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/williamsburg_waterfront_concerts_to.php">this battle</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142830/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/video_nitrous_oxide_fueled_fans_ter.php">expect more</a> come summer.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="wburgparkrend.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142830im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/wburgparkrend.jpg" width="640" height="271" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>They&apos;ve also announced that this new location will be called Williamsburg Park, and delivered <em>this</em> good news: &quot;the main thing we are happy about is there is no more beer garden. You can walk anywhere on site with your beverage.&quot; No more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142830/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/pool_parties_1.php#photo-1">beer pen</a>! On top of that, there will still be local food, beverages and craft vendors throughout the venue, which will be about the same size as the previous waterfront space (capacity of around 7000 people).</p>

<p>As for booking announcements, they&apos;ll be hosting paid and free shows again this summer, today announcing the return of Swedish punk band Refused, who will play there on July 18th&#x2014;stay tuned for more announcements coming up shortly.</p>
