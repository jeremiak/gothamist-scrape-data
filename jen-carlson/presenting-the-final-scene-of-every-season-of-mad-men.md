---

	
										<p>The final scene of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064340/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> is now behind us. Showrunner Matthew Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064340/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/the-mad-men-season-finale-series-creator-matthew-weiner-discusses-the-phantom/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">has said</a> in the past that he always has a last visual image in mind when writing a new season, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064340/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/19/share_a_coke_with_jon_hamm.php">Jon Hamm</a> just told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064340/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/mad-men-finale-jon-hamm-interview/?_r=2">the NY Times</a>: &quot;We had talked about this ending for a long time and that was Matt [Weiner]&apos;s image. I was struck by the poetry of it. I didn&#x2019;t know what his plans were, to get Don to this meditative, contemplative place. I just knew that he had this final image in mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Below, a look at all of Weiner&apos;s season ending images, including the final scene that ended it all.</p>

<p><strong>Season 1: The Wheel</strong><br>
Don comes home to think he&apos;ll find his family in time to go away for Thanksgiving with them, but they&apos;ve already left, leaving him alone. As Don sits alone, the camera moves away from him as &quot;Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s All Right&quot; by Bob Dylan plays.</p>

<p><strong>Season 3: Shut The Door. Have A Seat.</strong><br>
Betty and Don decide to get a divorce, and as Betty flies away with her new husband Henry, Don is seen in Manhattan, getting dropped off in a cab at his new apartment. As he walks up the stoop, &quot;Shahadaroba&quot; by Roy Orbison is playing. Some of the lyrics are: &quot;Face the future and forget about the past... In the future you will find a love that lasts&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Season 4: Tomorrowland</strong><br>
After he has a parting drink with Betty in their old home, Don is back in Manhattan and awake in bed with Megan, who is sleeping. He looks out the window and &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; starts to play.</p>

<p><strong>Season 5: The Phantom</strong><br>
Don has just left Megan at a commercial shoot he landed for her, and is sitting at a bar alone. Weiner says: &quot;I envisioned.. that Don would be in that bar. That was the last image, always, that someone would come up and say, &apos;Are you alone?&apos; And we wouldn&#x2019;t know what he answers.&quot; Nancy Sinatra singing the theme to &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (a 1967 James Bond film) is playing.</p>

<p><strong>Season 6: In Care Of</strong><br>
Don pulls up to a run-down home. His kids are with him in his car, saying, &quot;This is a bad neighborhood.&quot; They all get out and stand in front of the house, and Don tells them, &quot;This is where I grew up.&quot; Judy Collins&apos;s rendition of &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; begins to play.</p>

<p><strong>Season 7.1: Waterloo</strong><br>
As Roger Sterling is making an announcement to the staff regarding Burt Cooper&apos;s death, Don heads downstairs, where he hears, &quot;Don my boy...&quot; Cooper then busts out into a song and dance. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064340/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/robert-morse-on-his-big-mad-men-number/">Matthew Weiner said</a>, &quot;As for &apos;The Best Things in Life Are Free,&apos; it is a very simple song with a very simple message: Life is bigger than business.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Season 7.2: Person to Person</strong><br>
In the final scene of the series, we see every character move on to their next step&#x2014;Peggy&apos;s in love with Stan, Joan is the head of her own company, the Campbells are moving to Wichita, Roger is with Marie Calvet, and Don is finding his inner &quot;om&quot; at a hippie retreat in Big Sur. Or rather, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818064340/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/19/share_a_coke_with_jon_hamm.php">finding his inner ad man again</a>. The last song we hear in a series that has delivered on great music moments... is a jingle for Coca-Cola. </p>
