</div></div>					<p>Last year Will Smith was widely lampooned over his luxury &quot;star&quot; trailer, named The Heat, which was taking up valuable street space in SoHo during the filming of <em>Men in Black III</em>. The 1,150 square-foot monstrous mobile home was one of 25 trucks (including one housing Smith&apos;s personal gym) on location during filming, and it eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220123/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/12/will_smiths_massive_trailer_evicted.php">got evicted</a>. Today Smith&apos;s new film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220123/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837709/"><em>Winter&apos;s Tale</em></a> is filming in the DUMBO neighborhood in Brooklyn, and this morning we passed this luxury trailer on Front Street, part of another similarly massive fleet of trucks and generators. We were unable to confirm if this is Smith&apos;s trailer (Jennifer Connelly, Colin Farrell, and Russell Crowe are also in the film), but it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220123/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/13/inside_the_heat_will_smiths_banishe.php#photo-1">seems like his style</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="trailer1112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220123im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/trailer1112.jpeg" width="640" height="184" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220123/http://www.lightnin.com/trilogy-triple-slide-out.html">The 42&#x2019; &quot;triple slide-out&quot; trailer</a> features a kitchen; entertainment area (with &quot;plenty of seating&quot; and a 42&#x201D; flat screen and satellite TV); split bath with full-sized shower and private water closet; a spacious bedroom with Queen-sized bed, 20&#x201D; flat screen with satellite programming and large walk-in closet.</p>

<p>Perhaps he can donate it to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220123/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> victims still without heat and electric while he&apos;s off set?</p>
