</div></div>					<p>The 11-bedroom/18-room Brooklyn Heights mansion that Truman Capote called home for ten years (writing <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s</em> and <em>In Cold Blood</em> there) is now on the market for a record $18 million. The house has only changed hands a few times, and in the 1950s was owned by Broadway art director Oliver Smith. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174700/http://www.nydailynews.com/real_estate/2010/05/10/2010-05-10_breakfast_nook_18m_capotes_luxurious_bklyn_digs_for_sale.html#ixzz0nXVLJHP0">the Daily News</a>, &quot;Capote said he got Smith blitzed on martinis to persuade his friend to rent him the house&apos;s garden apartment from 1955 to 1965.&quot; Once he got his foot in the door, he allegedly bragged about owning the place while throwing parties when Smith was out of town. The current listing includes this quote from Capote: &quot;I live in Brooklyn. By choice.&quot; Though not included by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174700/http://www.sothebyshomes.com/nyc/sales/0135204">Sotheby&apos;s</a>, it went on to say, &quot;Those ignorant of its allures are entitled to wonder why.&quot;</p>

<p>Fun fact: Author Arthur Miller also lived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174700/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/arts/03expl.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=arthur%20miller%20brooklyn%20heights&amp;st=cse">on Willow Street</a> for a time, as well as at 102 Pierrepoint Street, and 62 Montague Street... though never with Marilyn Monroe (as is sometimes rumored).</p>
