title: Lil' Kim's Lil' Visit from the Repo Man
---

	
										<p>The repo man says business is booming in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175914/http://cw11.trb.com/news/local/wpix-ff-repo-man,0,1722308.story">Channel 11</a> news report about the rise and tide of auto repossession -- the segment even features <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175914/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05022008/news/regionalnews/repo_raps_up_lil_kims_car_109079.htm">a cameo by Lil&apos; Kim</a>! Seems the rapper fell behind on at least four payments and when she refused to give up the keys to the $250K car, it was loaded onto a flatbed truck. She gave the repo men (who say the car is &quot;not hers&quot;) about the same respect she gave the reporters on her doorstep, who she told to &quot;get the f--- outta here. You are so f---ing ridiculous.&quot;  </p>

<p>Lil&apos; Kim has had car trouble in the past; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175914/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/31/lil_kim_license.php">last year</a> she was pulled over in <em>another car</em>, her new Lamborghini, when police noticed her license plate was missing (turns out she didn&apos;t have her license, either).  That car was allegedly a gift, as Kim&apos;s publicist claims the Bentley also was. </p>
