</div></div><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515101934/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/12/the_gutter.php">The Gutter</a>&#x2014;Williamsburg&apos;s favorite retro bowling alley&#x2014;has expanded its space and will be opening up their venue tonight, housed within the same building as the bar and bowling alley. (There&apos;s even a new bar just for the space!) Consider it a one stop shop for your drinking, bowling and music needs... of course, if you&apos;re more in the mood for strobe lights, pins on strings, and fancy leather couches,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515101934/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/22/brooklyn_bowl_readies_for_opening.php"> Brooklyn Bowl</a> is always right down the street.</p>
