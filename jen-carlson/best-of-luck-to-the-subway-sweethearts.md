The Subway Cyrano met up with his mystery lady last night for dinner, where they said they &quot;clicked.&quot; Hayton suggests the subway moment was serendipitous because she wouldn&apos;t have been on it (going to a friend&apos;s place) if her house hadn&apos;t just burned down. </p>

<p>Moberg is compared to a Hollywood leading man, willing to do anything to &quot;get the girl,&quot; this is prequeled and followed by a montage of movie moments (<em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>, <em>South Pacific</em>, <em>Princess Bride</em>). To the cynical haters: Moberg <em>didn&apos;t</em> mention his job, Vimeo or Jakob Lodwick. Also, Camille is adorable, totally wore a flower in her fancy-braided hair, but <em>did</em> mention Blackbook! Sawyer ended the segment sending them out of the spotlight to continue their adventure, but we bet we&apos;ll see them on the small screen again once Ann Curry comes callin&apos;. (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064240/http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3843059&amp;affil=wabc">video of the two on GMA</a>.

Land Grant, for those who don&apos;t know, is a Brooklyn publication whose latest issue includes stories from Daniel Wallace (author of <em>Big Fish</em>) and artwork by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064240/http://www.stevekeene.com/skbio.html">Steve Keene</a> (who has created album covers for bands like Pavement). Below is their dark take on the outcome of this story.</p><blockquote><em>Best of Luck</em> <br>
by Dave Schuman, Josh Melrod and Dave Koch<p></p>

<p>In front of the press, Patrick pops the question. They are always in front of the press, it seems. From their very first meeting in the coffee shop on Bedford, the press has been with them. With the flashbulbs going off he notices things about her face, the kind of things you can only notice about a face when it&#x2019;s lit brightly for an instant. Later, in his bed alone, Patrick will try to forget them, he will try to remember her as she first appeared on the train, writing in her little book, the flower in her hair slightly wilted, which is what made it sweet.</p></blockquote> <p></p>
