<p>Following each ticket frenzy in New York, there&apos;s chatter about creating some new system that allows fans to see bands without paying high fees or scalper prices. <em>Dream on, people</em>. Or not? Enter City Council Member Dan Garodnick.</p>

<p>The chair of the Consumer Affairs Committee announced earlier today that his committee &quot;would hold an oversight hearing on business practices that may hinder fans from getting a fair shot at buying in-demand tickets at their original, face value.  The committee will also explore fan-friendly measures to give greater flexibility to ticket buyers and bring transparency on the actual number of tickets available for sale at a given event.&quot; The first hearing is Friday morning; and if this all pans out, can we call it the Radiohead Law?</p>

<p>He was inspired, as many are, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142927/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/27/what_are_radiohead_fans_offering_fo.php">by Radiohead</a>. The band played two shows at Roseland Ballroom this summer, each selling out in seconds. Fans reported that tickets showed up on secondary-sale website Tickets Now (operated by Ticketmaster&#x2019;s parent company) minutes before the public sale began, and at a higher rate. In the past, everyone from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142927/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/20/katy_perry_comes_to_new_york_next_m.php">Katy Perry</a> to Taylor Swift to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142927/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/21/lcd_soundsystem_ticketgeddon_now_wi.php">James Murphy</a> to venues like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142927/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/25/who_really_screwed_over_lcd_soundsy.php">Bowery Presents</a> have been accused of holding tickets back for the purpose of selling them above face value via secondary markets.</p>

<p>Garodnick says, &#x201C;Fans deserve to buy tickets in a marketplace that is fair and transparent. It&#x2019;s no secret that events sell out in a matter of minutes and that not everyone will get the ticket they want&#x2014;we all know that.  But there may be ways to level the playing field, let fans know what they&#x2019;re up against, and restore some of the rights of transfer that ticket buyers always had.&quot; Good luck, and godspeed Garodnick... you&apos;re going up against a very sneaky music industry.</p>
