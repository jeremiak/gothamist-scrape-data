</div></div>					<p>On April 25th, 1947, David and Sigrid Fleay arrived at the Bronx Zoo with platypuses named Cecil, Penelope and Betty, who were accommodated in a new platypusary built to the Fleay&apos;s specifications. Below is some great old newsreel documenting the event.</p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SUt3w7mrwC4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222835oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/SUt3w7mrwC4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>Sadly, Betty died of a cold, but Cecil and Penelope adjusted to their new home and there were hopes they would create a family there. In 1957 an article in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222835/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809719,00.html">TIME</a> was published, telling their story:</p>

<blockquote>Penelope Platypus was one of those saucy females who like to keep a male on a string. Cecil Platypus is one of those males. They lived mid the pleasures of their own platypusary in New York&apos;s Bronx Zoo, where each had its own little swimming pool and private burrows. Back in 1953 Penelope <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927222835/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,819263,00.html">fooled everybody with a false pregnancy</a>. But the zoo never gave up hope. Neither did Cecil. Last month platypus observers noted that something was up in the platypusary... Cecil began to court Penelope.</blockquote>

<p>Then one day in 1957, Cecil couldn&apos;t find his Penelope. She escaped the platypusary, and was never to be seen again; Cecil died two years later. The platypus is no longer in any American zoos.</p>
