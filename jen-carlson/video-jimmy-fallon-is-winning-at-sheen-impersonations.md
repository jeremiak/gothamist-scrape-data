<p>Previously we saw Jimmy Fallon unveil his new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013926/http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/">Late Night Snack</a> ice cream with Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s, but the real reason the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013926/http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/">late night host</a> is winning today is because of this spot-on impersonation of Charlie &quot;Tiger Blood&quot; Sheen, packaged up parody-style in a commercial for &quot;Winning (For Men)&quot; cologne.
