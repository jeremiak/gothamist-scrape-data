A classic pick is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902131133/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/06/sixth_borough_stealing_nyc_resident.php">Philadelphia</a>, and more recently there&apos;s been CRAZY TALK of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902131133/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/01/new_trend_moving_to_cleveland.php">Cleveland, Ohio</a> becoming a destination for priced-out New Yorkers. In fact, we received many personal messages from ex-New Yorkers living over there, singing its praises as the nation&apos;s &quot;best kept secret.&quot;</p>

<p>Before Cleveland, there was talk of Jersey City, Atlanta, and even <em>Yonkers</em> as being contenders for the coveted title&#x2014;they&apos;ve all garnered press as <em>the</em> latest migration trend (as have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902131133/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/01/the_atlantic_is.php">the suburbs</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902131133/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/19/new_york_love_it_or_leave_it.php">Kansas City</a>). So, if we&apos;re going to extend a prestigious 6th Borough title upon one of them, which should it be?</p>
