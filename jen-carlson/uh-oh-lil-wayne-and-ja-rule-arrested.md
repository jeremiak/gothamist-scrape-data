The separate incidents both took place in the city.</p>

<p>Lil Wayne, fresh off the Beacon Theater stage following his Sunday night show there, was found smoking pot by his tour bus on 61st and Columbus Avenue at 11:30pm. What not to do while smoking an illegal substance, on the street, in the city? Carry a firearm. Lil Wayne had a .40-caliber pistol, and he and his friend were charged with criminal possession of a weapon and marijuana. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, one hour earlier, Ja Rule was arrested on West End Avenue. His luxury sedan was speeding when the cops pulled it over. Then they arrested him as well as other occupants of the car after finding a .40-caliber pistol. Guess it&apos;s the handgun of choice these days!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113112/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/jukebox/?p=678">Lil Wayne collaborated with Ja Rule</a> on a new track called &quot;Uh Oh.&quot; Though it&apos;s unclear if Ja Rule was at Beacon Theater performing with him last night, both arrests took place fairly close to the venue.<br>
