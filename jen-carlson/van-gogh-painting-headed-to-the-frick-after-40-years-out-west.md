From October 30th through January 20th, 2013, The Frick Collection will proudly display the painting, which van Gogh painted in August 1888. They say:<p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;The painting has not left its home institution, the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California, in nearly forty years, making this a rare and exciting viewing opportunity for East Coast audiences. The modern masterpiece will be shown in the Frick&apos;s Oval Room... accompanied by lectures, a seminar, and gallery talks. In the nearby Multimedia Room, a brief video presentation will discuss the results of new research and the painting&apos;s examination, while an introductory video will be shown in the Music Room.&quot;</blockquote>The real masterpiece at The Frick, however, is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505133342/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/29/inside_the_fricks_secret_rooms.php#photo-1">bowling alley they keep hidden away</a>.<p></p>
