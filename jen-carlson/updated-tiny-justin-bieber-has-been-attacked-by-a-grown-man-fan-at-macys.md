<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> Justin Bieber&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231842/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/biebers_minions_already_taking_over.php">Macy&apos;s appearance</a> got off to a rough start today when the pop star was attacked by a man who jumped over the barricades! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231842/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8208674">ABC Local</a>, the Biebs was knocked to the ground while greeting fans outside of the Herald Square store. The unidentified man knocked Bieber to the ground after jumping over a barrier. But don&apos;t worry, he&apos;s going to be okay, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231842/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/justin-bieber-injured-by-fan-20110623-lgf">Fox reports</a> he has &quot;minor&quot; injuries, other outlets are saying he&apos;s just a little shaken up.</p>

<p>It would be shocking if this were the only injury at the event today&#x2014;Women&apos;s Wear Daily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231842/https://twitter.com/#!/womensweardaily/status/83980113628250112">Tweeted</a> from the scene, saying, &quot;Fifty frenzied photographers on ladders are frantically trying to get shots of Justin Bieber at Macy&apos;s. Elbows are being thrown.&quot;</p>

<p>The man was apprehended by police, and security has gotten tighter around the pop star. We&apos;ll update when there are more details, and more photos of the carnage. For now, bask in these screams:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Turns out the man who attacked Bieber was just trying to help him! An undercover NYPD officer was trying to help out when Bieber stepped into an unruly crowd of fans outside of Macy&apos;s. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231842/http://www.tmz.com/2011/06/23/justin-bieber-undercover-police-clash-cops-nypd-macys-security-team-disorderly-conduct/">TMZ reports</a> that &quot;Bieber didn&apos;t know the guy was a cop&#x2014;so when the cop got close to Justin... Bieber got defensive thinking he was a crazy fan.  A member of Bieber&apos;s security team immediately grabbed the cop and tried to pull him away. The cop quickly identified himself&#x2014;and cited the security team member for disorderly conduct.&quot; And EVERYTHING IS FINE NOW. In fact, as of 5 p.m. Bieber was still inside Macy&apos;s signing autographs for fans. What a little trooper.</p>
