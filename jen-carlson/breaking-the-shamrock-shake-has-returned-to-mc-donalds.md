<p>Every year we celebrate the return of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://gothamist.com/tags/shamrockshake">Shamrock Shake</a>, but every year our enthusiasm dwindles. The seasonal McDonald&apos;s shake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/13/shamrock_shake_still_not_sold_in_ne.php">was absent</a> from New York City until 2010&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/shamrock_shake_back_in_nyc_confirme.php">when it returned</a> with much fanfare. Our inability to attain the minty shake had made us all need it that much more, and things were going great for a while...</p>

<p>Soon the shake was celebrated on television&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/18/we_have_jimmy_fallon_to_blame_for_s.php">Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</a>, and people everywhere were panicking about a rumored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/24/youll_recall_how_outraged_we.php">shortage</a>. But then in 2011, around the time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/21/shamrock_shake_at_the_rainbows_end.php">it was prominently displayed</a> that the shake contained 680 calories, people seemed apathetic. We can&apos;t even remember if we had one that year. </p>

<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/shamrock_shakes.php">the shake went National</a>, but again, no one seemed to care. So what could possibly bring back the magic of the 2010 Shamrock Shake Riots? This year it seems someone in the McDonald&apos;s Meme &amp; Virality Division heard about the Harlem Shake thing everyone is talking about, and now this exists:</p>

<p>But what really needs to be honed in on is the nostalgia angle! Back when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195552/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOVKdvkVAqQ">the commercial featured Grimace and Ronald McDonald</a> and calorie counts didn&apos;t exist. Anyway, the shake is available now, for a limited time... until next year.</p>
