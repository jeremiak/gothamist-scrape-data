<p>From the cookbook: <em>&quot;For informal get-togethers with their friends, Simon and Garfunkel have adapted an old-time New York favorite, Potato Pancakes, as an appetizer. The basic recipe is the same; only the size is different. For bite-sized appetizers, spoon the mixture with a teaspoon. As a main course, use this recipe.&quot;</em></p>

<p><u><strong>POTATO PANCAKES</strong></u><br>
(serves 4)</p>

<p>4 large potatoes<br>
1/4 cup milk<br>
1 onion<br>
2 tablespoons flour<br>
1 teaspoon salt</p>

<p><em>Grate potatoes into the milk. Grate the onion into the mixture. Add flour and salt and mix well. Spoon mixture one tablespoon at a time into hot oil. Brown on one side, then turn. Drain on a paper towel, and serve piping hot with apple sauce or sour cream.</em> </p>
