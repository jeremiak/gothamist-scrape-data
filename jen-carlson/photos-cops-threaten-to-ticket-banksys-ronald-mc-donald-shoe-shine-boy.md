<p>Sean Shapiro witnessed the scene and tells us, &quot;About five police cars showed up with ten officers.&quot; Well, that seems extreme! But the NYPD has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001900/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/nypd_intent_on_bringing_banksy_to_j.php">actively seeking Banksy</a>, the NY Post bleated for his capture on their front cover, and officers have been asking building owners where Banksy has hit to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001900/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/nypd_vs_banksy.php">file charges</a>. Shapiro told us:</p><blockquote>&quot;The two in the photos approached him asking questions... one of the other officers nearby had his ticket pad out ready to go and I overheard him say that they could give him a disorderly conduct, as he was blocking sidewalk traffic and a crowd formed. The same officer was pretty knowledgeable on the meaning of the piece as he was explaining it to another officer.<p></p>

<p>The officers stood by for a while as the actor was texting and calling one of the other members of the crew and it took about five minutes before a guy [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001900/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php#photo-10">Steve Zissou-sky</a>!] showed up to carry away the statue into a dark van.&quot;</p></blockquote>If only the NYPD caught <em>two</em> of the movable Banksy installations together in Greenwich Village yesterday, just sitting there like a double rainbow: <p></p>
