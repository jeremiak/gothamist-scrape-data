<p>Brooklyn Bridge Park has announced their free outdoor movie series lineup for the summer. Appropriately titled Movies with a View, the screenings take place every Thursday night on the Harbor View Lawn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155239/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/park/pier-1">in Pier 1</a>, overlooking the East River and Lower Manhattan. There are a lot of outdoor movie venues around the city, and this one is arguably the sweetest of them all (though it&apos;s a bummer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155239/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/22/squibb_bridge_lawsuit.php">the pedestrian bridge</a> won&apos;t be able to get you there this time around).</p>

<p>In the past the series has had a summer-long theme, and this year&apos;s is &quot;This American Life.&quot; The selection of films is meant to reflect the cross-section of American experiences. (The third film in the series, <em>Purple Rain</em>, was actually selected before Prince&apos;s passing.)</p>

<p><strong>July 7th</strong>: Singing in the Rain<br>
<strong>July 14th</strong>: Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle<br>
<strong>July 21st</strong>: Purple Rain<br>
<strong>July 28th</strong>: It Happened One Night<br>
<strong>August 4th</strong>: American Graffiti<br>
<strong>August 11th</strong>: Selma<br>
<strong>August 18th</strong>: A League of Their Own<br>
<strong>August 25th</strong>: This evening&apos;s movie will be chosen by the masses&#x2014;options have not yet been announced</p>

<p>All of the movies are free, and you are welcome to bring food and blankets to sit on. (No hard chairs though.) </p>

<p>Each film is preceded by shorts curated by BAMcinematek, with pre-show music provided by DJs from Brooklyn Radio. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016155239/http://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a> will also be providing bike valet services.</p>

<p><em>Disclosure: Gothamist is a media sponsor of this year&apos;s series.</em></p>
