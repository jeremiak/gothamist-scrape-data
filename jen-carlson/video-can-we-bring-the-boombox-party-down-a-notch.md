<span class="photo_caption">Maybe next year it can be more like this?</span></p>

<p>Over the weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065630/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/boombox_party_coming_to_nyc_this_mo.php">the Boombox Party</a> took to our city, basically bringing people (some in suits, <em>none</em> in Lloyd Dobler trench coats) to the streets with boomboxes, which were all blasting a mix tape filled with what sounds like mostly predictable songs. To be honest, it looked kind of annoying, but you know, we&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065630/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/12/its_time_for_santacon_to_stop.php">waging war</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065630/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/no_more_no_pants_subway_ride_please.php#photo-1">against &quot;fun&quot;</a> lately... just see (and listen) for yourself in this below video documentation. </p>

<p>Masses of young people blasting mostly terrible techo-based music you&apos;d likely find on Snooki&apos;s iPod, crowding the sidewalks and subways? No thank you! Idea: next year can we do this but with only Elliott Smith songs? Just something a little more sullen, you know? It may help us embrace this group activity.</p>
