<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145620/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/mad_men_10.php">Last night episode of <em>Mad Men</em></a> included a lengthy scene soundtracked by The Beatles <em>Revolver</em>-era psychedelic song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; (The scene directly contrasts an earlier scene where an advertiser <em>can&apos;t</em> afford to use a real Beatles song in his commercial.) The entire song plays, bringing the viewer from Don Draper&apos;s arm chair all the way to the end of the credits. So how much did that cost Matthew Weiner &amp; Co.? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145620/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/05/07/that-beatles-moment-on-mad-men-cost-a-cool-quarter-million/">Forbes</a> around $250,000 (about $150,000 more than a song by another band would normally cost).</p>

<p>They remind that the show was delayed after a contract stand-off between Weiner and the network, which revolved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145620/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/16/did_mad_men_kill_every_other_amc_sh.php">around money</a>. They also note that you almost never hear The Beatles in movies or television shows because &quot;it&#x2019;s prohibitively expensive to license them, and even then they&#x2019;re not always for sale.&quot; Weiner reportedly got to use the song after making a personal appeal, and because Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are &quot;huge fans of the show.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145620/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/how-mad-men-landed-the-beatles-all-you-need-is-love-and-250000/?src=tp">ArtsBeat</a> talked to Weiner today, who told them, &#x201C;It was always my feeling that the show lacked a certain authenticity because we never could have an actual master recording of the Beatles performing... It always felt to me like a flaw. Because they are the band, probably, of the 20th century.&#x201D; Weiner says <em>Mad Men</em>&apos;s budget wasn&apos;t broken by the Beatles moment, adding that creatively, &quot;I never, ever think... &#x2018;Oh, let&#x2019;s not have a song here so I can save some money.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
