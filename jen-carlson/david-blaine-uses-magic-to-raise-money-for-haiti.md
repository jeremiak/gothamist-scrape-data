Word on the street is that the magician will be performing 72-hours of non-stop magic in Times Square to raise money for the victims of the earthquake. He&apos;s working with the Red Cross, and will start his magical marathon tomorrow at 9 a.m. (at West 43rd Street and Broadway). Every little bit helps.
