<p>Did you know you can still find chestnuts roasting on an open fire right on the streets of New York, despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083544/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/chestnut-tradition-toast-n-y-vendors-offer-treat-article-1.473997">the Daily News obit in 2010</a>? There are street carts hidden right before your very eyes that deliver on the seasonal fare, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083544/http://agendanyc.com/holiday/">one website</a> is tracking down those still partaking in what they say is a &quot;shrinking tradition&quot; (Smorgasburg&apos;s artisanal entrepreneurs, get on this!). So far they&apos;ve found twelve, all located on 6th Avenue between 53rd and 56th&#x2014;which will now be referred to as the Roasted Chestnut District&#x2014;but it&apos;s worth checking out any carts in the Midtown area during the winter months, as you&apos;ll probably stumble upon more. And the Roasted Chestnut Cart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083544/http://www.yelp.com/biz/roasted-chestnut-cart-flushing">in Flushing, Queens</a> is still going strong! </p>

<p>These holiday treats are even Bloomberg-approved, as one vendor says: &quot;Nothing is added to it&#x2014;no sugar, no salt, nothing.&quot; Bring it home, Bieber:</p>
