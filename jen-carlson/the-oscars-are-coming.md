Well, at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171933/http://www.nysun.com/article/71719?page_no=1">some 8-foot Oscar statues</a> for the official New York Oscar night celebration at the Carlyle hotel, where east coast industry folk will come together Sunday night as the show goes down in Hollywood. </p>

<p>Nominees were announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171933/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/22/oscars.php">on January 22nd</a> with Best Picture nods going to <em>Michael Clayton</em>, <em>Atonement</em>, <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, <em>No Country For Old Men</em> and <em>Juno</em>. The love and buzz continues to surround the latter, but will the indie take home the golden prize?  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171933/http://villagevoice.com/">Village Voice</a> film critic J. Hoberman told Gothamist he agrees with the predictions about <em>Juno</em> winning Best Picture because <em>No Country For Old Men</em> and <em>There Will Be Blood</em> voters will cancel each other out. He added that the Academy voters always love a good Hollywood &quot;underdog&quot; story, something <em>Juno</em> represents as the little indie that could.</p>

<p>As for <em>Michael Clayton</em>, George Clooney has declared himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171933/http://gawker.com/5003292/george-clooneys-hillary-clinton-attack-brilliant">the Hillary of the Oscars</a>, telling Time &quot;there is no way Daniel Day Lewis won&apos;t win. For me, it&apos;s like being Hillary Clinton. If it weren&#x2019;t for Barack Obama, it would have been a very good year. If [Michael Clayton], has a shot at anything, it&apos;s best supporting actress with Tilda Swinton.&quot; All of Clooney&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171933/http://www.time.com/time/2008/clooney">picks are here</a>; the NY Times&apos; David Carr (aka The Carpetbagger) has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171933/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/movies/awardsseason/22osca.html?ref=movies">his thoughts about who will win here</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven&apos;t seen <em>any</em> of these movies, free up your day tomorrow and buy a $30 ticket to see them all consecutively <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171933/http://www.amctheatres.com/promos/showcase">at AMC Theaters</a>.
