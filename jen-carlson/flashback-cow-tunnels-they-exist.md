</div></div>					<p>Is there a &quot;Cow Tunnel&quot; somewhere beneath 12th Avenue <em>right now</em>, just waiting for landmark designation? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000251/http://www.ediblegeography.com/cow-tunnels/">Edible Geography</a>, historian Betty Fussel discovered that cattle traffic was so heavy in the 1870s that a tunnel was built to increase the flow to slaughterhouses along 12th Avenue and 34th Street.

A laborer went into the hole with a torch and came out saying it was an oak-vaulted tunnel ten feet wide by eight feet high that trailed off an undetermined distance in either direction. <strong>It was then that an old man from the neighborhood stepped up to the trench and said, &apos;Why, I see you found the cattle tunnel.&apos;&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>With little proof of their existence via a quick check of the Google Machine, and the DoT and NYCT pointing us towards dead ends... we still <em>wanted to believe</em>. So after some more digging, we found a PDF from 2004 showing a correspondence from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation&#x2014;the two agencies allegedly assessing the architectural and cultural uniqueness of the cattle tunnel. On page 73 it says:</p>
