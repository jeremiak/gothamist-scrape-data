Most recently, they&apos;ve been working on The Environmental Education Center and an annex of the Brooklyn Children&apos;s Museum all the way on the DUMBO side; and at the other end, Pier 6 has been given some new plant life in the form of a flora-filled field. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108074358/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/12/when_is_squibb_bridge_opening.php">Squibb Park Bridge remains closed</a>, a new bridge has been installed near John Street. This bridge&#x2014;which isn&apos;t open to the public yet&#x2014;is meant to &quot;show visitors how the tides come in and out through the day.&quot; Click through for a look at these latest features in the park; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108074358/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/27/brooklyn_bridge_park_before_after.php">proceed here</a> to see some before and after shots of how the BBPC Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation has transformed the area.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108074358/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/nyregion/brooklyn-bridge-park-opening-new-vistas.html">the NY Times</a>, the Pier 6 additions include &quot;profusions of swamp milkweed, rose mallows and cardinal flowers,&quot; and red and purple flora &quot;which stretches for 1.3 miles along the East River.&quot; Regina Myer, president of the BBPC, pointed out that the natural beauty now on display is on top of &quot;a concrete deck in the middle of the East River&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108074358/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/26/14_photos_of_dumbo_before_it_was_du.php#photo-1">SEE IT</a>).</p>
