<p>Remember H9Z4? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114955/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/31/photo_marked_canada_goose_spotted_i.php">How could you forget this face</a>! He&apos;s been given a new name, Pierre, and today unofficial resident wildlife rehabilitator of Prospect Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114955/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/04/anne-katrin_titze_prospect_parks_un.php">Anne-Katrin Titze</a>, tells us that the Canada goose (who migrated from Quebec recently) is still alive! </p>

<p>He&apos;s pictured here with six resident Mute Swans, and Titze tells us, &quot;A great reason to come to Prospect Park now is to see the four cygnets, hatched from a nest on Prospect Park Lake on May 21st last year, flying around the partially unfrozen lake with their parents.&quot; Just don&apos;t bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301114955/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/nyc_andrea_peyser_wants_to_kill_you.php">Andrea Peyser</a>, okay?</p>
