</div></div>					<p>The last time we saw The National they were rubbing elbows with the likes of Julia Stiles in a fancy bank vault after their epic 20-song set <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135752/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/the_national_celebrate_high_violet.php">at BAM</a> (filmed by <em>the</em> DA Pennebaker)&#x2014;but last night they were amongst the trees playing to the masses in Prospect Park. And everything was right in the world once again. </p>

<p>The band has legitimately blown up, so there&apos;s no need to retrace their career here&#x2014;if you don&apos;t know <em>Alligator</em>, <em>Boxer</em> or their most recent release, <em>High Violet</em>, then <em>get thee to a record shop</em> (and pick up their other 2 LPs and EPs while you&apos;re there). They&apos;ll be playing a sold out show at Terminal 5 tomorrow night, and then depart the city for quite some time&#x2014;your next shot at catching them is September 24th at the Wellmont Theater in New Jersey (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135752/http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/TicketPurchase?pid=6787325&amp;agency=WELL_PLAGENCY">tickets still available</a>). Here&apos;s some video of &quot;Bloodbuzz, Ohio&quot; from last night&apos;s show:</p>

<p>This is the same band whose drummer, Bryan Devendorf, kept a tour diary for us on their trip to SXSW in 2005&#x2014;in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135752/http://gothamist.com/2005/03/25/dear_sxsw_diarypart_2.php">he wrote</a>: &quot;This party is in an office park several miles out of town. It&apos;s sparsely attended. Our set is good, too. A tree falls in the forest. There&apos;s so many bands here. So many. It&apos;s like the infinite number of monkeys with typewriters only we are the monkeys, we rock-and-rollers, we suckers.&quot;</p>
