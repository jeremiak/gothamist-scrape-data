<p>If you hated <em>Gangs of New York</em> the movie, it was probably at the very least <em>in part</em> because of Cameron Diaz, so maybe you&apos;ll like the TV series better? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013712/http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/miramax-martin-scorsese-developing-gangs-of-new-york-tv-series/">Deadline</a> reports that Miramax and Martin Scorsese are developing a series based on the 2002 film. </p>

<p>The show &quot;will draw from the events surrounding organized gangs at the turn of the century and shortly thereafter in America, not only in New York but in other cities such as Chicago and New Orleans and the birth of organized crime in America.&quot; Scorsese feels that &quot;we could not fully explore&quot; the full scope of the 19th-century world in the two-hour movie&#x2014;&#x201C;A television series allows us the time and creative freedom to bring this colorful world, and all the implications it had and still does on our society, to life.&#x201D; (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013712/http://www.avclub.com/articles/gangs-of-new-york-might-be-a-tv-show-now,95823/">AV Club</a> jokes, &apos;And no, I don&#x2019;t watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013712/http://gothamist.com/tags/copper"><em>Copper</em></a>,&apos; Scorsese did not add, obviously.&quot;)</p>

<p>There are scarce details otherwise regarding the series, but hopefully it will run on cable so we can experience the full grit and bawdiness of old New York.</p>
