										<p>We&apos;re not that in to the whole Fashion Week scene, and it&apos;s been pretty easy to ignore its existence in this city. We even missed the whole Fashion Rocks show on tv last week. Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161826/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHl0l9sJSMg">Arcade Fire and David Bowie performed</a> at it together, this year Jared Leto&apos;s band 30 Seconds to Mars did. Not the same. We feel we don&apos;t give enough opportunity for you to comment on what happened to the artist formerly known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161826/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Etd_CYI_k">Jordan Catalano</a>, so here  you go:<br>

Related: For those that missed the Fashion Rocks tv broadcast, we&apos;re pretty sure you didn&apos;t miss much, but you can still catch it. Tonight at 7 pm AT&amp;T; will be airing a one-time-only exclusive webcast of the Fashion Rocks concert and the Elton John pre-party. <a href=" http://blueroom.att.com/fashionrocks/">Watch it here</a>.  </p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161826/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPAdvwTEBRI">here&apos;s a great video</a> from a 1970&apos;s tv show which included a DIY &quot;punk rock fashion show&quot;. Definitely worth checking out, though we&apos;re pretty sure punk rockers did not &quot;boogie&quot; like that. </p>
