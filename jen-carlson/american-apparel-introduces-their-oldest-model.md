</div></div>					<p>It wasn&apos;t long ago that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015951/http://gothamist.com/tags/americanapparel">American Apparel</a> was receiving criticism for not including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015951/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/06/american_apparels_little_white_deep.php">&quot;real people&quot;</a>&#x2014;well Dov Charney has fired back with his latest model: Jacky. She is introduced on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015951/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150184949609979.65009.5677674978&amp;type=1">their Facebook page</a> with a nice meet-cute story that took place in NYC:</p><blockquote>&quot;There was something so compelling about Jacky&apos;s look and energy when we first spotted her in a New York restaurant this winter, we introduced ourselves and pulled up a chair. During a long discussion that touched on everything from career choices and nutrition to insights on relationships, age and beauty, we asked if she would consider being photographed by us. We were thrilled when she agreed.&quot;</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015951/http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/american-apparels-newest-model-is-also-their-olde">Buzzfeed Shift</a> has been tracking the comments on the page, which are split between immature and welcoming, noting, &quot;If I had to wager a guess on what, exactly, ruffled so many feathers I would put my money on&quot; the classic AA spread eagle pose.<p></p>

<p>We, for one, welcome American Apparel&apos;s newest and oldest (and classiest) model, and hope she gets to grace one of the company&apos;s billboards.</p>
