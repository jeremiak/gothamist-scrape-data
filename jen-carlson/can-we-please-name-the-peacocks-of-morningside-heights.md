</div></div>					<p>You don&apos;t see this in Manhattan every day... unless you frequent Saint John the Divine, that is. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524071801/http://outwalkingthedog.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/great-white-peacock-of-morningside-heights/">blogger in Morningside Heights</a> spotted the white peacock on the grounds recently, complementing the more colorful ones that have been there for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524071801/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/10/nyregion/neighborhood-report-morningside-heights-real-city-bird-cathedral-s-peacock.html">over two decades</a>. This &quot;sole white peacock&quot; has been on the grounds for some years as well, and sometimes he even explores the city... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524071801/http://onbooksandbiblios.blogspot.com/2011/01/cathedral-peacock-and-books.html">earlier this year</a> he was spotted strutting his stuff down Amsterdam Avenue!</p>

<p>Seems like these guys should have names by now (allegedly none of them do!), sort of like how the wild turkey of Battery Park was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524071801/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/zelda_still_kickin_in_battery_park.php">named after Zelda</a> Fitzgerald (and her habit of disappearing in that area during her breakdowns). Any ideas?</p>
