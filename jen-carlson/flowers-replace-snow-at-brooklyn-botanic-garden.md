<p>Signs of spring are showing up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140414/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/08/early_flash_of_spring.php">in our forecast</a>, but check out what&apos;s showing up at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. They took the above photo of their Crocus Field today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140414/http://twitter.com/bklynbotanic/status/10181946239">and Twittered</a>: &quot;Wow. Amazing what some sunshine can do to a once snow covered field near the Rock Garden.&quot; While crocuses typically thrive in late winter and early spring, it&apos;s still nice to see some flowers on the ground in place of snow. The Garden just suffered through a tough winter, even losing their century-old Cedar of Lebanon tree.</p>
