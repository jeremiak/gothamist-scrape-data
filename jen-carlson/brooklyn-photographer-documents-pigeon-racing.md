<p>What does pigeon racing look like up close and personal? Well, we already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131221180554/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/12/video_3.php">sort of know</a>, but now Brooklynite photographer Aaron Wojack has documented the subculture in still photographs. Check out all of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131221180554/http://www.aaronwojack.com/pigeon.html">pictures here</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131221180554/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/10/pigeon-flying-in-new-york-city/">Animal</a> offers up this amazing quote from pigeon-racer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131221180554/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/22/peta_takes_on_tyson.php">Mike Tyson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>One morning I woke up and found my favorite pigeon, Julius, had died. I was devastated and was gonna use his crate as my stickball bat to honor him. I left the crate on my stoop and went in to get something and I returned to see the sanitation man put the crate into the crusher. I rushed him and caught him flush on the temple with a titanic right hand and he was out cold, convulsing on the floor like an infantile retard.</blockquote>

<p>[Insert blank stare.] Yeah, so, here&apos;s a tour of his pigeon coop in Harlem:</p>
