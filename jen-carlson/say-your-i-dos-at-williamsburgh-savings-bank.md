<p>What once housed the Williamsburgh Savings Bank, a slew of dentist offices, and now luxury condos, will take on yet another purpose: wedding hall. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140327043021/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/26/32_26_mm_wsb_room.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that &quot;the landmark ground floor of the Williamsburgh Savings Bank building will open in September as a sumptuous catering hall for weddings.&quot; Mmm sumptuous. They&apos;ll also host your bar mitzvahs, corporate Christmas party, or any other high-end special events. Prices start at $15,000 to book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140327043021/http://www.bluejake.com/archives/2009/06/30/night_at_the_williamsburgh_savings_bank.php#more">the beautiful space</a> in Fort Greene, which will be called the Clocktower at One Hanson (despite being many floors below the clocktower); the booker called that figure &quot;Brooklyn-sensitive pricing.&quot; </p>

<p>Since the building is landmarked, the interior won&apos;t be undergoing any renovations; &quot;the vaulted ceilings with images of the night sky, a mosaic of colonial New York on the wall, wooden bank teller stations and marble tables will be untouched.&quot;</p>
