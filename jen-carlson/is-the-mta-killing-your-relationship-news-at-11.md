<p>Last year we delved into the idea of dating outside of one&apos;s borough&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322201029/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/14/do_you_date_outside_your_borough.php">there were even <em>graphs and charts</em></a>&#x2014;and found that some people will only stay with geographically desirable partners. (We are a cold-hearted and lazy people!) Now with the recent news of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322201029/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/pols_circumcising_the_g_train_exten.php">the G train extension getting cut</a>, cross-borough relationships are at risk of fizzling out, according to some &quot;lovebirds&quot; who spoke to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322201029/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/12/dtg_gtrainlove_2012_03_23_bk.html">The Brooklyn Paper</a>.</p>

<p>One woman in Greenwood Heights says that cutting the five stops in Park Slope, Windsor Terrace and Kensington would make it &quot;almost impossible&quot; to see her boyfriend in Greenpoint, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322201029/https://twitter.com/#!/LincolnRestler/status/177441707506401280">others confirm</a> they&apos;d simply end things if the G cuts went through. If not now, then eventually&#x2014;as a recent study found, couples who commute more than 45 minutes are 40% more likely to break up.</p>

<p>It&apos;s probably better to just stay inside, alone, anyway. You won&apos;t have to shell out the big bucks for the unlimited MetroCard anymore, and you can stop delaying the inevitable&#x2014;let&apos;s not forget what Charles Bukowski once said, &quot;There&apos;s no chance at all: we are all trapped by a singular fate. Nobody ever finds the one.&quot;</p>
