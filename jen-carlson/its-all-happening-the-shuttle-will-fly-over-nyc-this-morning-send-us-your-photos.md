<p><b>[UPDATE: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050458/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/27/photos_the_space_shuttle_enterprise.php">We haves photographs now!</a>]</b> Last April, after <em>a lot</em> of lobbying, New York City was granted one of NASA&apos;s retired Space Shuttles. Sure, it&apos;s the shuttle that performed test flights in the atmosphere and never actually orbited space, but it&apos;s <em>our shuttle</em>. Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050458/http://gothamist.com/tags/spaceshuttle">the Enterprise</a> will finally come (to its new) home&#x2014;flying over Hudson River, the Statue of Liberty and the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum. (The arrival was already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050458/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/20/space_shuttle_arrival_postponed_no.php">delayed once</a> due to unfavorable weather.) </p>

<p>Expect to spot it between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m., after which it will land at JFK. We&apos;re told the shuttle (attached to a Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft) will be flying at a low 1,500 feet, so you&apos;ll be able to capture some great photos of the event (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050458/http://dcist.com/2012/04/spacegasm_yep_that_was_a_space_shut.php#photo-1">the Discovery flying over D.C.</a>). There will also be two T-38&apos;s serving as photo support flying alongside of it.</p>

<p>If you get some good shots, send them along to us at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050458/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">photos@gothamist.com</a>, tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr, or hashtag them #Gothamist on Instagram. Our photographer Katie Sokoler is on the ground at JFK, and later today we&apos;ll have her photos of the shuttle&apos;s arrival there.</p>
