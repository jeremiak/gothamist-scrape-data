The actor, who portrayed the former meth kingpin on <em>Breaking Bad</em>, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324113618/http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/breaking-bads-giancarlo-esposito-and-healing-power-gus-fring-44131?page=0,1">The Wrap</a> that recently he was stopped and frisked by NYPD officers while walking out of a theater where he was rehearsing for a play. Officers were allegedly screaming at Esposito with their guns drawn for minutes before realizing they had the wrong guy. Reportedly one officer recognized him from ABC&apos;s &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (c&apos;mon, NYPD... not from <em>Breaking Bad</em> or <em>Do The Right Thing</em>?).</p>

<p>Esposito didn&apos;t go too into detail about the incident, telling the Wrap, &quot;I refuse to walk around, carrying that sack of racist crap.&quot; 87% of the 684,330 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324113618/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/13/nypd_on_track_to_shatter_stop-and-f.php">NYPD stops</a> in 2011 were black or Hispanic; and now the NYCLU has made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324113618/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/06/take_a_look_at_the_nyclus_new_stop.php">an app</a> for reporting such interactions.</p>

<p>The play Esposito was rehearsing for is &quot;Storefront Church,&quot; which is currently running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324113618/http://www.entertainment-link.com/other-theater/off-broadway/plays/storefront-church.asp">off-Broadway</a> at the Atlantic Theater Company Linda Gross Theater.</p>
