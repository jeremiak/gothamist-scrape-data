<p>We like Loehmann&apos;s! You can get discounted designer-y things to wear there. And we like the song &quot;Hold On&quot;! Before it was even featured in <em>Bridesmaids</em>. But that does not mean the two should be paired up. Wilson Phillips, <em>you are better than this!</em></p>

<p>The ladies played the store on 16th Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602110556/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/wilson_phillips_playing_free_show_n.php">yesterday evening</a>.
