										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="goathead1010.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316043219im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/goathead1010.jpg" width="175" height="247" class="image-right"> </span>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316043219/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/20/slaughtered_animals_found_in_prospe.php">bags containing animal parts</a> were discovered in Prospect Park, upping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316043219/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/07/prospect_park_2.php">the body count</a> of slaughtered animals discovered there this year. But then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316043219/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/22/albino_squirrel_spotted_in_prospect.php">an albino squirrel</a> was spotted in the park, alive and well, and we forgot all about the gruesome discoveries... until now. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316043219/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/44/dtg_butcherfolo_2010_10_29_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> (they have photos), a goat head believed to belong to one of the dismembered bodies found last week, has now been found.</p>

<p>The paper reports that the head was covered in orange wax, about 100 feet away from the parts found last week. The unlucky man who spotted it told them, &#x201C;I was walking my dog, sending texts on my Blackberry, and then I saw it. I thought, &#x2018;Man, is that the head?&#x2019; It&#x2019;s gross.&#x201D; Nearby were two plates, which were also both covered in wax, as well as food scraps, indicating a Santeria offering.</p>

<p>Be careful out there, albino squirrel.</p>
