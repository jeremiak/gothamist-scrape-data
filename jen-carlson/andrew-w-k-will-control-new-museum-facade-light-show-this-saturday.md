<p>This Saturday the facade of the New Museum will change from boring, unchanging silver to a tripping-your-face-off multi-colored light-based installation. For four hours on Saturday (8 p.m. to midnight, split into sound and silent portions) the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035003/http://www.changeofstate.org/">Change Of State</a> installation will light up Bowery as part of the Ideas City Festival.</p>

<p>&quot;Change of State features notable artists and architects casting building-scale projections onto the museum&#x2019;s 174-foot facade,&quot; and to make things more raucous, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035003/http://gothamist.com/tags/andrewwk">Andrew W.K.</a> will kick off the entire event with a live performance &quot;using his keyboard to activate and control world renowned French artist Agathe de Bailliencourt&#x2019;s multicolored light-based installation, inspired by the UFO musical dialogue scene from the 1977 sci-fi classic, <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>. Each key of W.K.&#x2019;s synthesizer will be connected to a different group of vibrantly colored rhomboids projected onto the entire front of the internationally renowned contemporary art museum. W.K. will improvise using the shapes and sounds as he performs live, right on the street in front of the museum.&quot;</p>
