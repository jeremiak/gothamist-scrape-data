<p><strong>[UPDATED BELOW]</strong> An artist was shot and killed in Red Hook yesterday evening around 5:45 p.m., found with one bullet to the head and one to the chest, according to police. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151856/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/year_old_artist_shot_dead_in_red_elawKlgXObe9JOdVMZ6PTO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">The NY Post</a> reports that &quot;he was gunned down inside the ground-floor apartment on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151856/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=summit+street+and+hamilton+avenue+brooklyn&amp;sll=40.679399,-74.003593&amp;sspn=0.020211,0.043473&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Hamilton+Ave+%26+Summit+St,+Brooklyn,+Kings,+New+York+11231&amp;ll=40.68266,-74.004174&amp;spn=0.002526,0.005434&amp;t=h&amp;z=18">Summit Street near Hamilton Avenue</a>... the victim used the apartment as both a studio and living space.&quot; Neighbors say the entire block is filled with creative types, and none of them heard a gun shot. Police haven&apos;t released the name of the victim yet.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151856/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/01/11/2011-01-11_slay_victim_is_found_in_bklyn_art_gallery.html">The Daily News</a> is now reporting that the man was shot at a New Age art gallery, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151856/http://www.spaceageherbalist.org/">Lotus Temple of Visions Gallery</a>, where he was watching television at the time. The gallery also serves as a crash pad for traveling artists. There were no signs of a forced entry, and police believe he may have known the killer. A neighbor told the paper, &quot;There&apos;s all kinds of people coming in and out,&quot; but &quot;nothing like this has ever happened over here.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151856/http://carrollgardens.patch.com/articles/summit-street-shooting-details-emerge">Carroll Gardens Patch</a> reports that the victim was 31-year-old Tajeme Sylvester. This afternoon his sister Najila was outside of the gallery, and said she &quot;came to see [where it happened]. I still can&apos;t believe it.&quot; She says her brother lived in Bed-Stuy, but was doing renovations at the Red Hook space, and he &quot;knew the guy who lived there.&quot; </p>

<p>Sylvester&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151856/http://www.facebook.com/tajeme#!/tajeme?sk=wall">Facebook wall</a> is already filling up with messages from those who knew him&#x2014;all in response to his last status update, which read, in part: &quot;full of wanderlust for life and living.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114151856/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/man_killed_killer_brooklyn_art_gallery_bq5LS4hwWN87AoLHBsq2LJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">The NY Post</a> is also confirming that the victim was Sylvester, a native of Jamaica and a Fordham University graduate. They report that the owner of the gallery was out of town, and Sylvester was staying there while working on the space.</p>
