<p>From 2004 to 2011, the number of people who have died or were injured while walking and wearing headphones rose from 16 to 47. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040731/http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/16/headphones-can-endanger-life-study">The Guardian</a> points us to a new U.S. study, published by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040731/http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2012/01/03/injuryprev-2011-040161.short?g=w_injuryprevention_ahead_tab">Injury Prevention</a> journal, which notes that most victims were men under the age of 30 (around 68% in both cases). 89% of the 116 total incidents occurred in urban areas, with 55% being struck by a train. Looks like these numbers are pointing directly at us, NYC!</p>

<p>In the cases, of which 70% were fatal, headphones were always involved, and playing &quot;a direct part in the incident, as the users could not hear warnings that they were in danger,&quot; even in the cases where sirens were used. Researchers say the link between headphone use and pedestrian injury is either distraction or environmental isolation. They added, &quot;The use of headphones with handheld devices may pose a safety risk to pedestrians, especially in environments with moving vehicles. Further research is needed to determine if and how headphone use compromises pedestrian safety.&quot;</p>
