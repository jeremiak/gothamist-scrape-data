<p>Is the Catpack the new Bugaboo? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045653/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/this-just-happened-a-catpack.html">Erica at FIPS</a> spotted what she calls a Catpack in Park Slope earlier today. Basically, a cat owner places their feline friend in a semi-transparent cage-bag hybrid. On their back. Like a baby carrier. Yes, perhaps these two pals were simply going to the vet... but this is Park Slope we&apos;re talking about, so odds are they were going to enjoy some locally brewed beer at a nearby bar, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522045653/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/park_slope_parents_still_bringing_b.php">with some babies</a>. It&apos;s actually nice to see that cat people are becoming more social.</p>
