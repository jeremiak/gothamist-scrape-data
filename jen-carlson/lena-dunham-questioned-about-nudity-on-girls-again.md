<p>Last night at a Television Critics Association panel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012919/http://www.thewrap.com/judd-apatow-lena-dunham-get-mad-asking-shes-naked-much-girls/">The Wrap&apos;s Tim Molloy</a> asked Lena Dunham about nudity on her show <em>Girls</em>. He addressed her, and the panel (which included Judd Apatow and Jenni Konner), saying: &quot;I don&apos;t get the purpose of all the nudity on the show. By you particularly. I feel like I&apos;m walking into a trap where you say no one complains about the nudity on <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but I get why they&apos;re doing it. They&apos;re doing it to be salacious. To titillate people. And your character is often naked at random times for no reason.&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, if Molloy&#x2014;who probably should have dug a little deeper for a new topic&#x2014;stopped before that <em>Game of Thrones</em> comparison maybe this would not have happened, but at the foundation he was asking why Dunham has written herself into the show naked so many times. And this did not go over well with the trio on stage, who are probably pretty much over being asked about this.</p>

<p>Dunham started out, replying: &quot;It&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s a realistic expression of what it&#x2019;s like to be alive, I think, and I totally get it. If you are not into me, that&#x2019;s your problem.&quot; Fair enough! But then Apatow spoke, using some classic defensive bro-speak: &quot;Do you have a girlfriend? &quot;Does she like you? Let&apos;s see how she likes you when you quote that with your question and just write the whole question... and tell me how it goes tonight.&quot; In other words, in a Judd Apatow Production of this panel, Molloy (played by Seth Rogen) would not be getting laid that night.</p>

<p>But Molloy said his girlfriend <em>is</em> curious about the frequent use of nudity on the show&#x2014;&quot;<em>Girls</em> has more nudity by its lead character than any show, well, ever. But my girlfriend and I don&#x2019;t understand the reason for it. We&#x2019;re cool with nudity, and if Dunham wants to be naked, great. I&#x2019;m not offended by it. I don&#x2019;t like it or not like it. I just don&#x2019;t get the artistic reason for it, and want to understand it, because I&#x2019;m a TV critic,&quot; he told the panel.</p>

<p>Apatow&#x2014;whose heart was probably in the right place&#x2014;later called the question &quot;sexist, offensive, [and] misogynistic.&quot; Some have had the same of <em>Knocked Up</em>. And Jenni Konner said she went into a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012919/http://defamer.gawker.com/question-about-lena-dunhams-nudity-sparks-rage-spiral-1498637627">rage spiral</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, this is complicated. And I was not at this panel, and the tone Molloy asked the question in could change everything, but...</p>

<p>Last week I watched the first six episodes of the new season of <em>Girls</em>, which starts up again on Sunday night, and it did seem as though Dunham&apos;s character got naked a lot. Possibly more than in previous seasons (someone make a chart!), and as in previous seasons it almost becomes distracting at times&#x2014;I found myself questioning what nudity was bringing to each scene, and... &quot;Why is she naked in the kitchen in the middle of the day? Is this how other people live? Am I wearing clothes too much in my apartment?&quot; And other times it makes complete sense&#x2014;because who hasn&apos;t been here?:</p>

<p>The other times when the nudity has nothing to do with sex or changing ones clothes or bathing... can&apos;t we just suspend disbelief? Because it&apos;s great that Dunham is getting naked. Why not? And hasn&apos;t she had to answer enough questions about this? Get over it, critics. </p>

<p>And of course, it&apos;s hard not to assume that these questions would not be asked as frequently if Dunham were a Cookie Cutter Hollywood Starlet bending to the unrealistic physical standards set by the industry and society. A couple of years ago I had asked her about how she&apos;s avoided the self conscious pitfall that many women fall in to, and I thanked her for putting herself out there (&quot;watching <em>Tiny Furniture</em>, I was like, &apos;wow, a 23 year old is kind of teaching me to be comfortable with my body...&apos;&quot;). She told me, &quot;That means so much to me. Like the most meaningful thing to me. I am comforted by the fact that I find a real range of female bodies beautiful, and I hope that other people do too. And even if they don&apos;t find it beautiful I hope they&apos;re just glad that something like it is happening on TV.&quot;</p>
