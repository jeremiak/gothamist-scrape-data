<p>Most people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826215645/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/11/survey_says_cab_riders_hate_taxi_tv.php">turn off Taxi TV</a> when they&apos;re hailing a ride, but here&apos;s one thirty second reason not to: a gorgeous video by Ryan McGinley for Sigur R&#xF3;s&apos;s &quot;Var&#xFA;&#xF0;&quot; will soon be coming to the small backseat screen. </p>
