<p>Ladies, ladies, ladies... just look at yourselves. Is this where you thought you&apos;d be in your twenties? Digging through garbage on the side of the street for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101063235/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronuts">a Cronut</a>? It&apos;s time to really take a look at some choices you&apos;ve made in life, starting with the decision to dig through trash for a piece of discarded pastry. </p>

<p>The tipster who sent us this photo witnessed this all go down last night outside of Dominique Ansel Bakery, telling us that &quot;it wasn&apos;t even a finished Cronut... it was burnt and unfilled.&quot; The bakery never has Cronuts to toss out at the end of the day, so this was just a casualty from the frying process. Our tipster added, &quot;It was a really sad moment. One of the cooks ran out and told them it was unsafe to eat, and they cursed at her and ran away.&quot;</p>

<p>Just two young ladies trying to make it in this crazy world...</p>
