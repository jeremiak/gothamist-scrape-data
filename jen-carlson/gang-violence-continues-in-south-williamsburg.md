										<p>Hey South Williamsburg residents, a heads up courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140826184240/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10142008/news/regionalnews/boys_are_pretty_bad_133571.htm">The NY Post</a> today: the gangs are still around, even if you haven&apos;t spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140826184240/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/12/stabbings.php">a machete</a> lately. The paper reports that the neighborhood has got its own &quot;offshoot of the notorious Bloods gang&quot; and they&apos;re going up against the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140826184240/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/14/williamsburg_gang_warefare_meets_yo.php">machete-wielding Trinitarios</a>. The Pretty Boy Goonies (aka the PBGs) are about a dozen strong, and allegedly have a continuous turf war going on with the Trinitarios in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140826184240/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Rodney+St+%26+S+5th+St+11211&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.71002,-73.956313&amp;spn=0.015777,0.035105&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr">Rodney Park</a>. Councilwoman Diana Reyna says, <strong>&quot;This is not fist-fighting we are talking about. They are using machetes to stab and slash, and screwdrivers. There are brawls in the streets, in broad daylight, stopping traffic.&quot;</strong> Police have upped their presence in the area, on the streets <em>and</em> on rooftops, and have also installed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140826184240/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/08/sky_watch_over_williamsburg.php">a Sky Watch</a> at Marcy and South 5th Street.</p>
