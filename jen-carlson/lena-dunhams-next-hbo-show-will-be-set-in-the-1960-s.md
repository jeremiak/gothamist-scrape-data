<p>While <a href="gothamist.com/2015/01/12/to_all_the_girls.php"><em>Girls</em></a> is still set to return in January 2016, Lena Dunham has already started working on her second HBO show: a half hour comedy set in the 1960s magazine world, called <em>Max</em>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923124406/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/hbo-max-series-lena-dunham-lisa-joyce-magazine-comedy-1201617081/">Variety</a>, HBO has ordered a pilot, which will be directed by Dunham. </p>

<blockquote>The pilot is described as a comedy set in 1963 and revolving around the stirrings of second-wave feminism, as seen through the eyes of an ambitious magazine writer who stumbles her way into the women&#x2019;s movement. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923124406/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2436809/">Lisa Joyce</a> has been tapped to star.</blockquote>

<p>Dunham will be working with her <em>Girls</em> crew off-screen&#x2014;including Murray Miller, Jenni Konner, and Ilene Landress. </p>

<p>Presumably the show will take place in NYC, the mecca of the magazine world, and the home of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923124406/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/business/media/helen-gurley-brown-who-gave-cosmopolitan-its-purr-is-dead-at-90.html">Helen Gurley Brown</a>&apos;s 1960s <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923124406/http://www.msmagazine.com/about.asp">Ms. magazine</a>, founded in the early 1970s by second-wave feminists Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes.</p>
