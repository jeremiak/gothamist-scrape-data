<p>We&apos;ve seen the subway system in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131555/http://gothamist.com/tags/1940s">the 1940s</a> through the lens of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131555/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/stanley_kubrick.php">Stanley Kubrick</a>, but below you can immerse yourself in it during a 9-minute short film capturing everything from the tokens and old school turnstiles, to the conductors and signal tower workers, to commuters causing delays by holding the doors, to the vending machines that used to be on platforms.
