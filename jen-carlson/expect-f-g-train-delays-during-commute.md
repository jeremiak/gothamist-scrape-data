Power had been turned off to remove the man, and as of 5:41 p.m. the aided had been removed. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164734/http://www.mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html">MTA</a> is reporting a service change and delays in both directions; &quot;F trains are running on the D line from the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue Station to the West 4th Street-Washington Square Station.&quot; We&apos;ll update if conditions changed, and if any more word comes through regarding the aided, who has been transported to Kings County Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The F and G train service has resumed with residual delays.</p>
