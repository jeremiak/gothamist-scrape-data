<p>Street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201716/http://www.agataolek.com/home.html">Olek</a> recently gave the Wall Street Bull a new look with this custom crocheted outfit... but she says, &#x201C;It lasted 2 hours.&quot; She posted this photo on her Facebook yesterday, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201716/http://twitter.com/#!/oleknyc/status/19234610965647360">the message</a>: &quot;Happy Bullish 2011!&quot; By that time the bull had shed its new colorful skin, however&#x2014;which is a shame because those colors probably would have really popped in this blizzard!
