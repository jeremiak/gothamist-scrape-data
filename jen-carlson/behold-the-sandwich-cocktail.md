<p>Ever had the urge to drink a liquified <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530225530/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/12/kfc_double_down_hype_meets_reality.php">Double Down</a>? Well, this is as close as you&apos;re going to get. Flor de Ca&#xF1;a rum recently gathered some brave press folk in midtown for a liquid lunch, or as they put it, &quot;savory carnivorous cocktails that invoke meat lovers favorite meals.&quot; We stayed a safe distance, but received photos of the drinks today. Here&apos;s what we &quot;missed&quot; (recipes below). Wonder what would be in cocktails created after classic New York City food (pizzas, knishes, bagels).</p>
