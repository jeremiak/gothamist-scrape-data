										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="phpzin6XnAM.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpzin6XnAM.jpeg" width="350" height="249"> <br> <i>Courtesy Stellar Rays</i></div> Clifford Owens might attempt a forced sexual act on someone this Sunday... all in the name of art. The multi-genre artist has been performing &quot;scores&quot; written by 26 different artists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/340">at MoMA PS1</a> every Sunday since last November, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://animalnewyork.com/2012/03/performance-artist-will-force-a-sex-act-on-the-ps1-audience-maybe-this-time/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Animal</a>, who says Kara Walker&#x2019;s &#x201C;score&#x201D; might be coming up next. Walker&apos;s instructions state: <p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;French kiss an audience member. Force them against a wall and demand Sex. The audience/viewer should be an adult. If they are willing to participate in the forced sex act abruptly turn the tables and you assume the role of victim. Accuse your attacker. Seek help from others, describe your ordeal. Repeat.&#x201D; </blockquote>

<p>In other words: performance art rape. However, at an interview at the Armory Show this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://www.galleristny.com/2012/03/will-clifford-owens-force-a-sex-act-on-his-audience-at-ps1-on-sunday/">Owens said</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think it will [involve penis penetration]... I don&#x2019;t know what women or men in that audience have been sexually assaulted or raped. So, I&#x2019;m real careful. I have to know that I can approach the audience.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If you want to see how Owens will bring Walker&apos;s instructions to life, head to MoMA PS1 this Sunday at 3 p.m., and maybe sit in the back?</p>
