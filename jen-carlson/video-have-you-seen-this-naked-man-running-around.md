title: Video: Have You Seen This Naked Man Running Around?
---

<p>So, this guy is running around town with nothing but a well-placed fanny pack. Little is known about the mysterious (&quot;world&apos;s fastest&quot;) nudist, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621083720/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2009/09/worlds-fastest-nudist.html">FreeWilliamsburg</a> points out that he is making a documentary (that will hopefully <em>never</em> hit the big screen). He also updates daily on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621083720/http://twitter.com/fastestnudist">his Twitter</a> and website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130621083720/http://nudistnews.tumblr.com/">the Daily Nude</a>, so you can appropriately avoid or stalk him.</p>

<p>More videos, if you dare, can be viewed here; including a particularly unfortunate one in which cooking risotto nude is involved.</p>
