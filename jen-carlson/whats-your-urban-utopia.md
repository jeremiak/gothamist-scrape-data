title: What's Your Urban Utopia?
---

<p>Ever wish you could have the best of all the boroughs? TONY takes a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124326/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/features/60501/new-yorks-best-neighborhoods-now">look at their ideal neighborhood</a>, with features culled from various areas in the city. The urban utopia looks a little something like this: the affordability of Inwood, the architecture of lower Manhattan, the design of the West Village, the shopping of Williamsburg, the food of Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen, the bar scene of the East Village, the arts community of the LES, the diversity of Jackson Heights, the parks of Egbertville, S.I., the street culture of Coney Island, and the eco-friendliness of Park Slope. The mag also has some fun with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117124326/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/features/60631/new-yorkers-play-neighborhood-word-association">stereotyping neighborhoods</a>--Park Slope is still the city&apos;s baby capital, the UWS still has money, and the Staten Island dudes still enjoy their J&#xE4;ger bombs.</p>
