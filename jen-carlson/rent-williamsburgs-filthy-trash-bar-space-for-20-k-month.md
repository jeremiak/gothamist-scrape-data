<p>A little bit of Olde Williamsburg (circa 2004), right in the middle of New Williamsburg, <em>could be yours</em>. This piece of prime real estate used to be called &quot;Trash Bar&quot; in the mid-aughts, when the area was more Real.</p>

<p>The &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/08/last_night_at_trash_bar.php">Trash Bar</a>&quot; hosted a number of bands, though you probably haven&apos;t heard of any of them. They also sold Pabst Blue Ribbon (called &quot;PBR&quot; by locals) for something like 2 bucks, and patrons sat on old worn-in car seats ripped from their vehicles. It was pretty dirty in there. It still is. </p>

<p>The space, located at 256 Grand Street, sits perfectly preserved in its own filth (a.k.a. &quot;hipster gold dust&quot;). An untouched tableau of a bygone era. This kind of authentic dive could never again exist in the now post-ironic neighborhood, unless it became a dive bar-themed restaurant that served small plates. (Just ask the former owner of Trash Bar, who made a move into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://ny.eater.com/2015/2/5/7987197/trash-bar-owner-wants-to-open-a-family-friendly-restaurant">the small plates biz</a>.)</p>

<p>The historic spot is now on the market, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/off/5231814293.html">the listing</a> notes that it&apos;s the &quot;perfect place to do a restaurant, bar or any other type of business&quot; (even an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/04/pain_has_a_face_urban_outfitters_wi_1.php">Urban Outfitters</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/26/j_crew_williamsburg_obvs.php">J. Crew</a>!) &quot;The place had an existing liquor license making it easy to obtain the license&quot; (perfect for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/17/starbucks_williamsburg_booze.php">Starbucks</a>!). &quot;Cooler that is located in the basement&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/ice_bar_made_out_of_ice.php">Brooklyn&apos;s first ice bar</a>!). &quot;11&apos; Ceilings&quot; (second location for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/james_murphy_guy_fieri_the_apocalyp.php">a James Murphy wine bar</a>?). &quot;2,400 sq ft&quot; (neighborhood&apos;s first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111157/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/james_murphy_guy_fieri_the_apocalyp.php">Guy&apos;s American Kitchen &amp; Bar</a>?!).</p>

<p>For just $20,000/month, your possibilities are endless and your future is bright, as long as you go with a Trusted Chain or something with small plates.</p>
