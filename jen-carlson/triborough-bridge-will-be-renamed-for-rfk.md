Kennedy claiming name to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183140/http://www.mta.info/bandt/html/triboro.htm">Triborough Bridge</a>. It immediately rose questions about RFK&apos;s carpetbagger status, and his importance (or lack thereof) to New York&apos;s history. </p>

<p>Most of you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183140/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/22/rfk_1.php">voted &quot;nay&quot;</a> on the renaming of the bridge, but lawmakers have just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183140/http://www.amny.com/news/local/transportation/am-rfkbridge0605,0,3578377.story">voted <em>for</em> it</a>. amNewYork reports that the final legislative approval was made on June 4th, just two days before the anniversary of his death (today). There will be &quot;minimal budgetary impact for the cost of changing signs,&quot; but will anyone actually change what they call the bridge? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183140/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/nyregion/06bridge.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">NY Times</a> says no.</p><blockquote>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been that way for a million years,&#x201D; said Morton Mozzar, an automobile-service consultant in Queens. &#x201C;If they had renamed it right afterwards, O.K., like they did with J.F.K. Airport.&#x201D; (The airport was called Idlewild but was renamed after President John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination in 1963. It only seems as if the Triborough has been around for a million years. Next month it will have been open for 72 years.)</blockquote>Renaming has happened before, and often doesn&apos;t stick. The Times brings up 6th Avenue vs. Avenue of the Americas (most call it the former), and starting in 2014 the New York Public Library will be named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183140/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/11/new_york_public.php">the Stephen A. Schwarzman Library</a>. Here&apos;s a list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183140/http://www.oldstreets.com/">old New York street names</a> -- maybe name changes <em>can</em> stick, no one calls Great Jones...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183140/http://www.oldstreets.com/search.asp?q=errs">Minthorne Street</a> anymore. As for when the Triborough Bridge&apos;s name change will go into effect, Gov. Paterson still has to sign the bill. <p></p>
