They&apos;re a self-described &quot;chamber rock band&quot; from North Carolina headed up by Daniel Hart, a  multi-instrumentalist who you may recognize from another lil band called St. Vincent. This week another band, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073243/http://www.myspace.com/wildsweetorange">Wild Sweet Orange</a>, interviewed them for us--today you can check out the latter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073243/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/17/gothamist_house_come_and_knock_on_o.php">at our show</a> (they play at 4:30 p.m.), and tomorrow put yourself in front of the Physics of Meaning at their final CMJ show at Rehab.</em></p><em>

<p><strong>Do y&apos;all have any tricks (besides drugs or alcohol) on how to keep the emotions alive with playing the same set every night?</strong> Lately I&apos;ve been dancing a lot during our shows, working on my night moves.  Even when I&apos;m singing at the mic, I try to think about James Brown and the way he would present himself in the concert footage I&apos;ve seen.  I&apos;m a white guy from Kansas, so it translates differently (a lot of spinning around in place while playing the violin and awkward knee-gyrating while singing), but James Brown is on my mind.   </p>

<p><strong>Do you like or dislike hotel towels? And why?</strong> I&apos;ve never felt a particular attachment to any towel I&apos;ve owned or used.  We stayed with our friend Jordan after our Athens, Georgia show at the beginning of this tour.  He had a towel with a giant picture of Spuds MacKenzie on it.  Two of my bandmates used that towel to shower, one right after the other, just to get closer to Spuds.  </p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite restaurant in New York?</strong> This question feels more difficult right now than most exams I took in college.  You want me to narrow it down to one restaurant.  Maybe if I had a week to think about it.  I&apos;ll go with Lombardi&apos;s for now.  That&apos;s some crazy good pizza.</p>
