<p>School&apos;s in session, and that means <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215011407/http://gothamist.com/tags/professorfranco">Professor James Franco</a> has begun his work molding the young minds of a few NYU students. While he missed the first two sessions, he has been involved with the students via Skype and other methods since May, and last Saturday night they met face-to-face for the first time. There were a few extra bodies in the classroom at Tisch, however, with the NY Times coming in with a photographer.</p>

</li><li>12.7 Inches<br>
</li><li>Hairy Osborne<br>
</li><li>Cocks and Geeks<br>
</li><li>General Cockspital<br>
