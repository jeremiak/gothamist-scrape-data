<p>Last night Countess Luann deLesseps of <em>Real Housewives of New York</em> &quot;fame&quot; appeared on <em>Law &amp; Order: SVU</em>, making two appearances throughout the show. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192356/http://jezebel.com/#!5769532/countess-luanns-acting-debut-on-svu">Jezebel</a> claims this was her acting debut, she actually made her debut on <em>Royal Pains</em> (a friend who watches that show told us!). You can watch the full episode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192356/http://www.hulu.com/watch/218620/law-and-order-special-victims-unit-bully">on Hulu</a> if you subscribe to their Plus membership, or just take The Internet&apos;s word for it and watch some clips (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192356/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/law-and-order-svu/the-craziest-episode-ever-law-39494.aspx">BuddyTV</a> says &quot;it was the silliest, most ridiculous episode ever&quot;). </p>

<p>Basically, the Countess spews off some lines about &quot;the death of white privilege&quot;&#x2014;which she believes that painting pictured represents&#x2014;before stripping down to a towel for her artist boyfriend. Did she become a &quot;special victim&quot;? We won&apos;t spoil it for you/we haven&apos;t watch the whole thing.</p>
