<p>In July of 1971, a 31-year-old John Lennon celebrated the conclusion of the <em>Imagine</em> album recording sessions with a party like no other, held at Allen Klein&apos;s home in Riverdale. The below footage, mostly taken by friend Jonas Mekas (and included in his 1996 film <em>Happy Birthday To John</em>) shows party guests like Ringo Starr, Phil Spector, Allen Ginsberg, Miles Davis, Andy Warhol, Yoko Ono (of course) and many others. Check out Davis and Lennon shooting hoops at the 5-minute mark, and Andy Warhol snapping Polaroids throughout.</p>
