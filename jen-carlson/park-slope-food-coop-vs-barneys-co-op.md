<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="phpwwojcWPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190559im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpwwojcWPM.jpg" width="300" height="245"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190559/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2433947202/">Wally G</a></span></i></div> The Park Slope Food Coop isn&apos;t too happy about the new Co-op in town: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190559/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/08/barneys.php">Barneys</a>. The department store is slated to open on Atlantic Avenue this year, and general manager of the food coop, Joe Holtz says they have illegally coopted the word co-op! The misuse of the term is considered a violation of state law, and a misdemeanor could have the retail giant facing a fine of... 500 bucks. <p></p>

<p>Holtz told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190559/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/16/all_parkslopefoodcoop_2010_04_23_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> he hasn&apos;t decided if he&apos;ll pursue the matter, but noted &quot;It&#x2019;s a new thing having a co-op in Brooklyn that&#x2019;s not a co-op. There is something wrong with that.&#x201D; While that may be, one Barneys spokeswoman said, &#x201C;The year 2010 will be our 25th anniversary since opening the co-op. We&#x2019;ve been using this phrase for a long time.&#x201D; But not as long as the food coop, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190559/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Slope_Food_Coop">was founded in 1973</a>!</p>

<p>So does the little guy have a case? Holtz pointed to the state&#x2019;s Cooperative Corporations Law &quot;that could possibly serve as a legal basis for a David v. Goliath showdown.&quot; It states that the term cooperative, or any abbreviation, cannot be used in a name &quot;except by a corporation defined in this chapter. Any cooperative corporation may sue for an injunction against such prohibited use of the term.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If you are left wondering why this is even an issue, Holtz claims it undermines their effort to brand the idea of cooperative shopping.</p>
