                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="new2deertick0911gothhouse.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827054003im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/new2deertick0911gothhouse.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Every so often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827054003/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/12/gothamist_house_presents_deer_tick.php">Deer Tick</a> takes on a Nirvana musical costume to become Deervana. Not a lot of people could pull this off, but they manage to do it, and for that reason their infrequent stints as Deervana usually sell out pretty fast. (Even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827054003/https://twitter.com/SarahMroue/status/82591739134738433">Ben Affleck</a> can&apos;t get enough!) So if you wanna hear them perform <em>In Utero</em> in its entirety next month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827054003/http://www.brooklynbowl.com/event/349369-deer-tick-deervana-brooklyn/">get your tickets now</a>. The show will be held on the album&apos;s 20th anniversary, September 13th, at Brooklyn Bowl.</p>

<p><em>In Utero</em> was released on September 13th, 1993, and was recorded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827054003/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevealbini">Steve Albini</a> in February of that year at Pachyderm Studios in Minnesota. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827054003/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/kurt_cobain_1.php#photo-1">We visited the studio</a> back in 2008, and were told that when Nirvana booked time there they did so under the name the Simon Ritchie Bluegrass Ensemble. When the studio&apos;s intern was sent to pick the band up at the airport, he was surprised to see Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl awaiting him. We&apos;ll revisit that some more next month, for now, some more Deervana:</p>
