It&apos;s located somewhere in TriBeca, and we&apos;ve got someone headed over there now. We&apos;ll update when we have more information... but you should know, there&apos;s also one in Brooklyn Heights&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022743/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/theres_a_2nd_911_tribute_from_banks.php">we&apos;ve got the scoop on that right here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 11:55 a.m.:</strong> This piece is on Staple Street.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE, 12:30 p.m.:</b> There is naturally, a HUGE CROWD.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 3:30 p.m.</strong> The piece has been tagged by a truther! Reader Kane&#x2014;who sent in the below photo&#x2014;tells us, &quot;I was there. It was a guy a on a Vespa, he never took off his helmet the whole time he did it. Before he did it, someone got in his face and backed him off a little distance. There was almost a Banksy inspired fist fight.&quot;</p>

<p>But that&apos;s not all... a dog also peed on it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022743/http://twitter.com/socialstreger">A tipster</a> sent in the below photo explaining, &quot;The owner wanted to get a picture of her pug with the Banksy in the background. Only, the pug got stage fright and started to pee on the piece.&quot; Check out those crowd reactions: </p>
