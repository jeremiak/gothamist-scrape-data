<p>You can ride on a piece of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519214728/http://gothamist.com/tags/michaeljackson">Michael Jackson</a> history right on Coney Island! That sounds weird, but it&apos;s true. The Dragon Wagon Kiddie Coaster is the very same one that used to reside in Michael Jackson&#x2019;s private amusement park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519214728/http://www.rcdb.com/de/ig4322.htm?picture=1">at Neverland Ranch</a>. Reportedly Earl &#x201C;Butch&#x201D; Butler, CEO of California-based Butler Amusements purchased the ride last year. Butler is old pals with recent Coney addition John Strong &quot;whose sideshow has been operating in Sitt&#x2019;s would-be Dreamland since April. Strong kept calling him and said they were having trouble getting rides. Butler agreed to fly out and see the situation. His impression: &apos;Coney Island needs upgrading.&apos;&quot; And that&apos;s how a piece of Neverland ended up in Brooklyn.
