<p>HBO&apos;s next foray into the &quot;ladies in New York City&quot; genre comes from Judd Apatow and Lena Dunham, the mumblecore queen who will star in the show <em>Girls</em>, which focuses on the twenty-something set in the big city. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012923/https://twitter.com/#!/alexblagg/status/146289546508775424">Alex Blagg</a> gave some hopeful commentary this morning, saying, &quot;<em>Girls</em> might have a reverse-<em>Sex &amp; the City</em> effect on NYC, where everyone who moves there acts cool and funny and real.&quot; </p>

<p>Could the influx of Carrie Bradshaw wanna-bes moving here come to a screeching halt, or at the very least, get tempered by an influx of girls who <em>don&apos;t</em> want to be a Carrie or a Samantha or a Charlotte or a Miranda? Or at the very <em>very</em> least, could we get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012923/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/young_writer_who_moved_to_nyc_finds.php">some more realistic math</a> happening with this show? In the trailer, Dunham&apos;s character Hannah Horvath (this may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012923/https://twitter.com/#!/hannahhorvath">her Twitter account</a>) declares, &quot;So I calculated, and I can last New York for three or four more days, maybe seven if I don&apos;t eat lunch.&quot;</p>

<p>The show will premiere in April 2012, along with another HBO show starring <em>Seinfeld</em>&apos;s Elaine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012923/http://www.aoltv.com/2011/12/12/hbo-veep-preview-video/">as the vice president</a> of the United States.</p>
