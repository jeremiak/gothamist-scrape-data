<p>It&apos;s Shark Week! Which is so much better and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/25/the_smurfs_are_coming_for_us_all.php#photo-1">less terrifying</a> than Smurf Week. We&apos;re already on day five (the television marathon is hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/20/shark_week_now_with_100_more_andy_s.php">Andy Samberg</a> this year), and we haven&apos;t even asked: <em>how&apos;s your Shark Week going?</em> That&apos;s good to hear. But if you want to celebrate off the couch and around the city (that&apos;s like Shark Week 3-D), we&apos;ve compiled a list of where you can shark it up around town:<br>
</p><ul><li>The NY Aquarium only has sand sharks (and one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/01/coney_island_lo.php">died back in 2008</a>)&#x2014;but they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.nyaquarium.com/animals-and-exhibits/exhibits/sharks.aspx">worth checking out</a>.<br>
</li><li>Head out to Long Island for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.longislandaquarium.com/adventures-sharkdive.html">a shark dive</a>... which means you&apos;ll be in a cage, surrounded by 10 or more circling sharks! <br>
</li><li>Staten Island also has some sharks, and you can even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.statenislandzoo.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=121">adopt one</a> for just $100 a year (according to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.statenislandzoo.org/pdfs/AdoptAnimalForm.pdf">adoption form</a>, one of the sharks starred in <em>Finding Nemo</em>).<br>
</li><li>If you&apos;d rather <em>eat</em> shark for your Shark Week celebration (we&apos;re not here to judge), then head to Surf Bar in Williamsburg where they will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.menupages.com/restaurants/surf-bar/menu">serve you up</a> their Penne with Shark or Shark Attack Chowder.<br>
</li><li>For more variety, you&apos;ll want to head to Congee Village on the Lower East Side, where they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.menupages.com/restaurants/congee-village/">have a lot of shark on the menu</a>... including the not very humane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/27/shark_fin_soup_served_at_over_55_ny.php">shark fin soup</a> (try to skip that one).<br>
</li><li>If you want to fancy up your Shark Week, Oceana has a Blackened Thresher Shark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.menupages.com/restaurants/oceana/menu">on the menu</a> (though you may want to call ahead to make sure they have it when you&apos;re craving it).<br>
</li><li>And of course, there&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/30/are_mexiqs_shark_tacos_ethically_un.php">MexiQ&apos;s Shark Tacos</a>&#x2014;being served up especially for Shark Week.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Now if only some NYC tattoo shops would jump on deck with the whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005024004/http://www.allornothingtattoo.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2895">free shark tattoo during Shark Week</a> idea (note: there&apos;s still time!).</p>
