<p>As the story goes, Hendricks was smitten with the chandelier in the restaurant, so &quot;Arend approached Il Buco owner Donna Lennard about buying the fixture, which he planned to propose under, but Lennard wasn&apos;t interested. Arend would not be dissuaded, however. He approached Warren Muller, who designed the piece, to create another for Il Buco.&quot; He told the designer, &quot;I&#x2019;ll send you a check, you make a new chandelier, you bless her restaurant with love from us, and then you bring that chandelier back to me, and you bless my marriage with love.&#x201D; And that&apos;s exactly what happened. Currently the Il Buco chandelier is illuminating Halloway&apos;s house in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Speaking of happy couples, the <em>real</em> Don Draper&apos;s wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150237/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2009/I-Married-a-Mad-Man/">penned an article</a> about being married to ad man Draper Daniels. Their start was less romantic; she recalls, &quot;&apos;I couldn&#x2019;t even think about marrying someone without a year&#x2019;s courtship.&apos; &apos;All right,&apos; he said. &apos;We&#x2019;ll count today as day one, then.&apos; And he put out his hand and we shook, as if sealing a business proposition.&quot;</p>
