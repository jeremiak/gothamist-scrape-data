</div></div>					<p>Honestly, Barack Obama&apos;s popularity has sort of waned, so to make Midtown Manhattan a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163225/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/obama_to_visit_manhattan_on_thursda.php">real epic clusterf*ck tomorrow</a>, a little Justin Bieber needed to be thrown in. The boy wonder announced his Macy&apos;s Herald Square appearance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163225/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/warning_bieber_and_his_fevered_fans.php">yesterday</a>, and ever since fans have been flocking to the store for his arrival. With Obama also arriving tomorrow, the area is on full &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163225/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/president-barack-obama-justin-bieber-new-york-city-gridlock-thursday-20110622-KC">Obama-Bieber Gridlock</a>&quot; watch, with a 100% chance of traffic and screaming girls.</p>

<p>We dropped by Macy&apos;s today, where Bieber&apos;s perfume &quot;Someday&quot; just went on sale, and fans had already infiltrated the store... but not <em>that</em> many? It seemed kind of tame. Anyway, the first 350 people who purchased a bottle would get tickets to see him, and one New Jersey mother&#x2014;who estimated that she&apos;s spent 70 hours of quality with her daughter waiting in Bieber lines&#x2014;grilled us, &quot;So, how did you find out about this 350 tickets if you buy the perfume thing?&quot; She then bought four perfume bottles, and said they&apos;d come back tomorrow anyway even if they didn&apos;t get tickets. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the real die hards, <em>the campers</em>, were given tickets last night and told to go home. (Pssh, when we were kids <strike>we</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163225/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/nkotbsb_needs_to_drop_the_sb_and_co.php">our friends</a> had to camp out <em>all night</em> for New Kids On The Block tickets!)</p>

<p>Inside, the store was filled with members of the Bieber army: Fans! Marketing people! Perfume sprayers! NYPD&apos;s Special Bieber Opps Unit! Macy&apos;s Someday&#x2122; Security Team! One of the guys from his marketing street team told us, &quot;Little girls were walking out of here crying. It was baffling.&quot; (This guy must have been a new hire.) And Macy&apos;s head of security assured us that they &quot;are well prepared. All the little people love him. We are well prepared [for tomorrow].&quot; Currently Biebs is taking it easy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163225/https://twitter.com/#!/justinbieber/status/83589846622408704">with his uncle Dave</a>.</p>

<p>In case you are wondering what Biebs&apos;s fragrance smells like, one member of his team told us, &quot;I mean I&apos;m no perfume expert but.... fruity overtones, some almond notes, very summer for girls, target audience is definitely girls ages 14 to 18.&quot;</p>
