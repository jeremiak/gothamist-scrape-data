<p>When the Dark Room first opened on Ludlow Street in the summer of 2004, it was a different era of the Lower East Side. Like, an era where you&apos;d see Interpol&apos;s Carlos D hanging around at bars and everyone was meeting up with &quot;Michael Caine&quot; in the bathroom, and Pianos didn&apos;t <em>totally</em> suck. So, granted the Dark Room has probably significantly changed in terms of what kind of people it draws these days, rumors that it&apos;s closing is sort tugging at our former self&apos;s drunken heartstrings. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160222012510/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2011/12/the-dark-room-being-replaced-at-165-ludlow/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BoweryBoogieALowerEastSideChronicle+%28Bowery+Boogie%29">Bowery Boogie</a>, the place may shutter sooner rather than later:</p>

<blockquote>The Community Board 3 SLA agenda for December reveals that a new entity is vying for the sub-level club at 165 Ludlow Street. If all goes according to plan, an establishment with the trade name of Bodegas will soon open here. Michael Auerbach is the applicant listed on record, and it just so happens the he&#x2019;s one of the principals behind the recently-opened No Fun just a few doors south. Paperwork submitted to CB3 reveals that Bodegas is seeking an on-premise liquor license within a resolution area, and also wishes to install a raw bar operation (seafood, oysters, etc.).</blockquote>

<p>Seems about right.</p>
