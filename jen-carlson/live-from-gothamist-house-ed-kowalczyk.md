<p>In late October, just before his solo album <em>The Flood And The Mercy</em> was released, we invited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142057/http://edkowalczyk.com/">Ed Kowalczyk</a> (who you know as the former lead singer of Live) to Ridgewood, Queens to play us some songs. Kowalczyk performed two new songs from his album (which, by the way, features R.E.M.&apos;s Peter Buck), as well as &quot;I Alone,&quot; and a surprise Bruce Springsteen cover! Tonight he plays his second sold out show in New York, before continuing on with his tour (we highly recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142057/http://edkowalczyk.com/tour-dates">checking him out</a> if you can). Below, the latest in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142057/http://gothamist.com/tags/gothamisthouse">Gothamist House series</a>.</p>
