<p>So a guy, a girl, and a goat walk into a Midtown pizza joint and order some slices... and proceed to eat those slices at a table... <em>with the goat</em>, and no one seems to care? This photo shows barely a reaction from other diners at La Famiglia, and it just ends up in the wasteland <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112521/https://twitter.com/#!/ReporterLeslie/status/177615896439824384">of Twitter</a> with a quick note: &quot;saw a goat eating pizza at La Famiglia on 50th &amp; B&apos;way.&quot; </p>

<p>Is this not the same city that just celebrated a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112521/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/14/squirrel_prefers_grimaldis_will_set.php">squirrel eating a slice of pizza</a> <em>in a tree?</em> C&apos;mon New York, this is a goat, sitting down at a table (with someone who looks a lot like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112521/http://gothamist.com/tags/bethennyfrankel">Bethenny Frankel</a>), inside of an establishment that just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112521/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/sarah_palin_donald_trump_eat_at_fam.php#photo-2">last year</a> Sarah Palin and Donald Trump had lunch at. Let&apos;s give this goat the attention it deserves. And also maybe alert the Department of Health. </p>

<p>We called La Famiglia this morning, and the man who answered was genuinely shocked to hear there was a goat in the restaurant last night&#x2014;&quot;A goat? In this restaurant? Eating pizza? No!&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112521/http://www.buzzfeed.com/nycsouthpaw/goat-eating-pizza-in-midtown-4xje">Buzzfeed</a>]</p>
