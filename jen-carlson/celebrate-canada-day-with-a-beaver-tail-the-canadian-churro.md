title: Celebrate Canada Day With A Beaver Tail, The "Canadian Churro"
---

	
										<p>Earlier today we learned about The Beaver Tail, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172845/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/01/pat_kiernan_canada_day.php">it&apos;s Canada Day</a> and everyone is sending us their Canada pitches. Okay, we&apos;ll bite. What is this thing? The below diagram we found online was intriguing enough to ask questions. Is a Beaver Tail just a fried thing that you attach all of your leftover Halloween candy to via a Nutella adhesive? Do they even have Halloween in Canada?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, Mile End Deli is selling the snack tonight at their Canada Day happy hour (5 to 7 p.m. at their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172845/http://mileenddeli.com/">Hoyt and Bond Street locations</a>). This is what their much more simple and pure version looks like: </p>

<p>They&apos;re marketing them as &quot;a popular Canadian fried dough snack&quot; (which are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172845/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeaverTails#/media/File:Barack_Obama_and_well-wisher_in_Ottawa_2-19-09.jpg">Obama-approved</a>). But TELL US MORE, Mile End&#x2014;&quot;So beavertails are a traditional Canadian snack&#x2014;they&apos;re dough flattened into thin ovals, deep fried quickly, and then tossed in cinnamon and sugar. They&apos;re sweet&#x2014;kind of like a Canadian churro or something.&quot;</p>

<p>An order at Mile End today costs $5, and they&apos;ll also have beer specials, along with plenty of poutine and smoked meat. There don&apos;t really seem to be any RULES when it comes to Beaver Tails, so we imagine you can put the poutine right on top one and make a Canadian Burrito.</p>
