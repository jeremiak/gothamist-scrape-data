<p>Today in 1974 Elton John was holding court at Madison Square Garden for a big Thanksgiving concert, where John Lennon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402175151/https://twitter.com/NYPLMilstein/status/273809322323083264">made a surprise appearance</a>, running onto the stage with a cape... this would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402175151/http://onthisday.goodnewsweekly.ca/2010/11/november-28-john-lennon-make-his-last.html">the last time</a> Lennon would ever perform on stage for a concert.</p>

<p>The show came at the tail end of Lennon&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402175151/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon#1973.E2.80.9375:_.22Lost_weekend.22">Lost Weekend</a>&quot; period, and he later said that he reunited with Yoko Ono the night of the show&#x2014;less than a year later he would become a father. It was rumored Lennon, who had basically quit the stage by this point, had gotten sick from nerves backstage before coming out&#x2014;however, he and Elton John had a bet that if their song, &quot;Whatever Gets You Through The Night,&quot; reached #1, he would perform it with him. It became Lennon&apos;s only solo #1 single in the United States during his lifetime.</p>

<p>After the duo performed the song, Lennon told the audience, &quot;I&apos;d like to thank Elton and the boys for having me on tonight. We tried to think of a number to finish off with, so that I could get out of here and be sick... And we thought we&apos;d do a number of an old estranged fianc&#xE9; of mine called Paul. This is one I never sang, it&apos;s an old Beatle number, and we just about know it.&quot; That song was &quot;I Saw Her Standing There.&quot;</p>
