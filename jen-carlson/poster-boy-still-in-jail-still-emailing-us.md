										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="wtfposterboy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/wtfposterboy.jpg" width="160" height="160" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610/http://gothamist.com/tags/posterboy">Poster Boy</a> (aka Henry Macyjewicz) has been back in the headlines lately after being sentenced to 11 months behind bars&#x2014;a sentence that came from a judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/11/poster_boy_victim_of_vindictiveness.php">some call</a> vindictive. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/poster_boy_is_almost_free.php">Yesterday</a> it was being reported (by the publishing house putting out his book next month) that Macyjewicz was going to be out on bail soon&#x2014;a claim that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610/http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?hubtype=practiceDetail&amp;id=1202458222427">the NY Law Journal</a> confirms. According to the Law Journal&apos;s article (subscription only),  after just one week on Rikers Island, the street artist was set free after an appellate judge granted his motion for bail pending appeal.</p>

<p>Allegedly, yesterday Appellate Division Justice Ruth C. Balkin set bail at $3,000, and Matyjewicz&apos;s attorney, Kerry Gotlib, said he&apos;ll be out by the weekend once paperwork goes through. But there&apos;s one problem, we called the Deputy Commissioner at the NYC Department of Corrections this morning, and he told us that Macyjewicz is in custody still as a sentenced inmate who will not be released until December 12th. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, not only have Poster Boy tags been showing up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/banksy_gets_dissed.php">on Banksy pieces</a>, but we have been receiving emails from Poster Boy&apos;s account. Whoever is writing these emails has now told us, &quot;Henry is NOT getting out yet. It&apos;s important to note that Kerry Gotlib is a corporate lawyer, not a criminal lawyer, and has an incorrect view of the current situation. Having said that I hear Henry is a fine fellow.  We couldn&apos;t have a prettier face representing our movement.&quot; Does Rikers have Wi-Fi? Who is Poster Boy? And why is this absurdity so shrouded in confusion? Someone fetch us our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdA__2tKoIU">little orphan Annie decoder ring</a>...</p>
