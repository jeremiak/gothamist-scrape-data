While its previous buildings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173846/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/28/lets_revisit_one_of_the_gorgeous_ol.php#photo-14">were gorgeous</a>, the current one&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173846/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/flashback_madison_square_garden.php#photo-1">opened in 1968</a>&#x2014;is a dismal atrocity that is somehow even worse than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173846/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/18/verizon.php">the loathed Verizon building</a> that sucks the life out of the Manhattan skyline. Kimmelman explains the upcoming process:<p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;The owners of Madison Square Garden are now looking to New York City to renew&#x2014;in perpetuity&#x2014;the special permit that allows them to operate an arena atop Penn Station. The Council could grant a 10-year permit, enough time so that the Garden and the various parties responsible for the station can come up with an appropriately aggressive plan to improve the site, a plan that should include discussions about a possible future home, elsewhere, for the arena. Renewal of the permit is one of the few points of leverage the city has over the Garden.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Pushing MSG off the current site would also aid in improving the over-capacity and ugly-as-sin Penn Station. The possibility of MSG moving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173846/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/06/if_madison_squa.php">was brought up in 2008</a>, as well, but since then the Dolan family has spent billions on upgrades, something the Times points out has been partially paid for by the taxpayers. This is due to a 1982 ruling by the State Legislature that granted a tax abatement&#x2014;by 2008 it was estimated to have cost the city $300 million.</p>

<p>The special permit&apos;s journey towards approval&#x2014;or stone cold REJECTION&#x2014;begins with Community Board 5, who will vote tonight. After that, Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer and the City Planning Commission will make recommendations, and the City Council will rule.</p>
