A new season. And an era of shorter seasons. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053822/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> is about to end with the final episode of their fifth season, which was split into two parts of 8 episodes each, and spaced a year apart. And now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053822/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> is about to do the same thing, but with even fewer episodes.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053822/http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/mad-men-final-season-to-be-split-for-airing-in-2014-2015-1200615083/?utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=breakingnewsalert">Variety</a>, the final season of <em>Mad Men</em> will start in the spring of 2014, and be split over two years, with seven episodes airing in 2014, and seven airing in 2015. </p>

<blockquote>&quot;The move allows AMC to extend its hold on its most signature original drama series. The split final season model has worked well for <em>Breaking Bad</em>, which was able to drum up anticipation for the final seven segs for a year, boosting viewership considerably. AMC ordered an additional episode for season seven from producer Lionsgate TV to allow the cabler to serve up what it cheekily dubbed &apos;a Seven and Seven.&apos;&quot;</blockquote>

<p>AMC notes that the first half of the season will be dubbed &quot;The Beginning,&quot; and the final half &quot;The End Of An Era.&quot; And of course, there&apos;s already talk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053822/http://laist.com/2013/08/21/will_there_be_a_mad_men_spinoff_set.php">of a spin-off</a>.</p>
