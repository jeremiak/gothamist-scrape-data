---

<p>Frances Bay, the 92-year-old actress that once fought over a marble rye with Jerry Seinfeld, has died at the age of 92. You would also recognize the character actress in her roles on <em>Twin Peaks</em>, <em>Happy Gilmore</em>, <em>Grease</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124160136/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0062844/">hundreds of other productions</a>. But for the purpose of keeping it in New York City, let&apos;s revisit that memorable <em>Seinfeld</em> scene: </p>

<p>The actress lived in Manhattan for a time, with her husband Charles Bay, and took up acting studies here in the &apos;70s with drama teacher Uta Hagen. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124160136/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/17/local/la-me-frances-bay-20110917">the LA Times</a>, she had various infections at the time of her death, and in 2002 had her leg amputated after being hit by a car&#x2014;but that didn&apos;t keep her from acting. She appeared as a regular on ABC&apos;s <em>The Middle</em>. Her husband died in 2002, and their son died when he was just 23 years old, leaving her with no immediate survivors.</p>
