<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> This YouTube video has it all: a highly intoxicated person, an unsteady documenter, very little information, no closure, and an MGMT soundtrack. The footage was uploaded last night, and we&apos;ve contacted the uploader to get more details about the scenario. But until we hear back, let&apos;s discuss: should the fellow straphangers have made more of a hands-on effort to help this guy out? Or were they all (except for the MTA worker who has a brief interaction with him) too drunk from the big game, too?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The uploader of this video tells us the MTA worker you see in the video &quot;saw the drunk man and called for employees to call the cops,&quot; saying he needed to be taken to the hospital. The incident took place around 2:30 p.m. yesterday, at Atlantic Ave and Pacific in Brooklyn, on the D line. The original has now been uploaded so you can hear what&apos;s going on:</p>
