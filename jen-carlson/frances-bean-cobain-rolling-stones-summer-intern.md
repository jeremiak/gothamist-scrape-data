Earlier this year she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144521/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20177088,00.html">told Harper&apos;s Bazaar</a> that her career aspirations involved photography and journalism, while hinting at the upcoming internship at the rock rag. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407144521/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07212008/gossip/pagesix/intern_attitude_120776.htm">The NY Post</a> reports via some &quot;insiders&quot; that <strong>&quot;she doesn&apos;t get coffee for anyone . . . calls in sick all the time and wears funny outfits.&quot;</strong> A <em>Rolling Stone</em> rep, however, assures all gossip-mongers that their rock star royalty is &quot;a great girl, and we&apos;re thrilled to have her.&quot; Besides, she&apos;s only <em>15-years-old</em> and already works full-time keeping her mother&apos;s train wreck from derailing past the point of no return.</p>
