</div></div>					<p>Creative Time always has some pretty cool stuff going on, their latest is Paul Ramirez Jonas&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121659/http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2010/keytothecity/">Key to the City</a>, a citywide public art project that allows everyone to explore open spaces in all five boroughs (which was kicked off today by Mayor Bloomberg himself, and will run through June 27th). The CT team tells us, &quot;The key eloquently connects the disparate sites to create a kind of poem of place, and asks how public is the public space of the city?&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how it works: you get, or give a key that will lead to &quot;a citywide scavenger hunt of back doors, front gates, community gardens, and cemeteries, and more.&quot; There are 20 sites all in all, which could be anywhere from inside of the Brooklyn Museum, to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. There are thousands of keys, which will be distributed from a kiosk in Times Square that is open daily. Recognize any of the locations?</p>
