<p>If you&apos;re hoping to usher in the New Year with some picturesque New York City fireworks, this is the one big holiday where the Hudson isn&apos;t hogging all of the pyrotechnics. Here&apos;s where you&apos;ll be able to see colorful explosions in the sky:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="phpfkXYHoAM.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpfkXYHoAM.jpeg" width="350" height="237"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block">Why not enjoy the fireworks from here? (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://www.flickr.com/photos/klingon65/6094090130/in/photostream/">Gary Burke&apos;s flickr</a>)</i></div> On New Year&apos;s Eve fireworks will be set off from <strong>Liberty Island</strong>, giving some residents off the East River <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/macys_to_screw_over_brooklyn_queens.php">a view again</a>. Head to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade (sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/photos_pier_5_opens_in_brooklyn_bri.php#photo-1">the new Pier 5</a> is still on dawn to dusk hours), to check out the action. If you want an even closer look, you can book a spot on one of the many cruises that go near the Statue of Liberty that night&#x2014;even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://www.nywatertaxi.com/tours/family-new-years">the NY Water Taxi</a> offers one up... for a whopping $100 + cash bar! We recommend the much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/bloomberg_right_stats_show_si_ferry.php">more romantic</a> and thrifty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k5967349-Staten_Island_Ferry_on_New_Years_Eve-New_York_City_New_York.html">Staten Island Ferry</a>, just BYOB, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/28/bloomberg_wont_shut_up_about_how_th.php">Bloomberg did back in the day</a>.<p></p>

<p>Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz will be on hand at <strong>Grand Army Plaza</strong>, where an ALL CAPS &quot;FIREWORKS SPECTACULAR&quot; is promised, along with some live music. Festivities begin at 11 p.m., and there will be free hot chocolate!</p>

<p>Of course, <strong>Times Square</strong> offers up fireworks during their sensory overload midnight extravaganza. They&apos;ll begin just as the clock strikes midnight, the ball has touched down, and confetti is swirling above you. You&apos;ll be so disoriented you won&apos;t even notice that underage kid puking on your shoes. Fair warning: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinyca/5312003209/">this video shows what you might realistically see</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to start off 2013 with a healthy run, join <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170913/http://www.nyrr.org/races-and-events/emerald-nuts-midnight-run">The Emerald Nuts</a> for their annual four-mile Midnight Run in <strong>Central Park</strong> again. Prior to the run, a deejay will spin tunes at Naumberg Bandshell (starting at 10 p.m.), where a costume contest will also be held, and then at midnight on the dot, the race beings... and so do the fireworks. You can even enjoy the fireworks as a spectator, we&apos;re not here to judge. (Closest entrance is East 72nd Street at 5th Avenue.)</p>
