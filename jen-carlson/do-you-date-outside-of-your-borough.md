<p>Remember that episode of <em>Friends</em> (sorry) where Ross is dating a girl in Manhattan <em>and</em> a girl in Poughkeepsie? He says, &quot;I can&#x2019;t decide between the two of them. Y&#x2019;know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she&#x2019;s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y&#x2019;know she&#x2019;s, well she&#x2019;s just as pretty, I guess she&#x2019;s smart, she&#x2019;s not fun.&quot; (To which Chandler Bing retorts, &quot;How can she be great if she&#x2019;s from Poughkeepsie? That joke would&#x2019;ve killed in Albany.&quot;) Okay, so the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430042651/http://www.howaboutwe.com/date-report/1343-nyc-poll-do-you-date-outside-your-borough">How About We</a> is wondering if people will date out of their own borough. Yep, something else to fear in the already harsh world of New York City dating: being &quot;geographically undesirable.&quot; We took an informal poll of friends and here&apos;s what we found out: </p><ul><li>A 30-something-year-old male from Williamsburg: &quot;Yes, i would... though I think outside of Manhattan and Brooklyn would be challenging.&quot;<br>
</li><li>An early 20s female from East Williamsburg: &quot;Yes, within reason. Williamsburg to downtown Manhattan. If I really liked someone I would make the effort to travel to them but I wouldn&apos;t be happy about it, I would prefer someone close. I wouldn&apos;t be psyched to date someone in Park Slope, from Williamsburg.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Another 30-something male from Williamsburg: &quot;Jesus, of course. Then again... she&apos;d have to be pretty hot to make me schlep to Staten Island or the Bronx. And I once did let something drop with a cute girl who lived in Hoboken.&quot;<br>
</li><li>A 20-something female from Manhattan: &quot;I mean probably not Queens, The Bronx, or Staten Island (actually, definitely not).. and if he was from Brooklyn then he&apos;d have to be from a place that&apos;s kinda easily accessible or has to be someone who is mobile enough that he would spend a lot of time in Manhattan.&quot;<br>
</li><li>An early 20s female from Prospect Heights: &quot;The person I&apos;ve been dating lives four blocks away, but he&apos;s probably moving to another neighborhood, and I&apos;m like, <em>ehhh</em>. But I&apos;d like to think I would date someone outside of my own borough.&quot;<br>
</li><li>A mid-20s male from the Lower East Side: &quot;Of course!&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p>And finally, an(other) early 30s male from Williamsburg told us: &quot;What are my options, like...is there a &apos;yes, but the girl has to be completely fucking awesome&apos;? It&apos;s just hard, because it&apos;s all relative.&quot; Going above and beyond, he then sent us this chart with &quot;distance&quot; on one axis, and &quot;attraction/interest&quot; on the other:</p>

<p>So where do you stand on dating outside of your borough&#x2014;tell us in the poll below, and here&apos;s another way at looking at it from a Manhattanites point of view, putting distance traveled in relation to how good looking the person is:</p>
