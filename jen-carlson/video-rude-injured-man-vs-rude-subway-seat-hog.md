He explains that he dislocated his knee last week and has a cane and knee brace, which is keeping his leg outstretched. Yesterday morning our hobbling protagonist &quot;got on the 4 train in the Bronx... the seats in the corners have signs above them saying that is seating for disabled/handicapped passengers. So I asked this lady if I could have the seat as I had to stretch my leg out and didn&apos;t want others stepping on it or it being in the way of others and she loudly refuses saying I should sit somewhere else... I point out the sign to her and she just starts cussing and refusing to move.&quot; </p>

<p>Oh Joey Boots, you could have so easily edited yourself down into the hero of this story&#x2014;she <em>did</em> hit you after all. But alas, you had to keep rolling and give us the unedited version.</p>

<p>Yes, it <em>is</em> frustrating to encounter a seat hog when someone disabled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174117/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/30/pregnant_women_find_subway_seats_ha.php">or pregnant</a> or elderly could use a seat more, however, Mr. Boots admits the train was empty, so did he really have to antagonize a fellow passenger on an early morning commute? Which he did, filming her for much of the ride, calling himself the &quot;the paparazzi for inconsiderate people,&quot; and telling the woman she was &quot;fat and ugly&quot; and had &quot;ugly eyebrows... like an alien.&quot;</p>

<p>Conclusion: there are no winners here.</p>
