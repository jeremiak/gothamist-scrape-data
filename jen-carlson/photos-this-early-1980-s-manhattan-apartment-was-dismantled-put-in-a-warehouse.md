</div></div>					<p>The Brooklyn Museum has a warehouse, and inside of that warehouse is one of the nicest apartments in New York City. It&apos;s vacant, but you can&apos;t rent or purchase it. You can&apos;t even see it with your own eyes. We tried.</p>

<p>Recently, a website called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809233058/http://docomomo-us.org/news/postmodernism_preserved_michael_graves_reinhold_apartment">Docomomo</a> pulled the curtain back on this postmodern gem, which is really a set of rooms designed by then-rising architect star Michael Graves, between 1979 and 1981. They were created as a bedroom, playroom, and library for Susan and John Reinhold&#x2019;s apartment, located at 101 Central Park West. They are now under lock and key in, presumably, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Were these model rooms, you may be wondering? No. Apparently some rich people build rooms inside their existing rooms, or something. They were dismantled when the Reinholds moved, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809233058/https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/114154/Library_and_Childs_Bedroom_from_the_Reinhold_Apartment_at_101_Central_Park_West_New_York_New_York?referring-q=Reinhold+Apartment">donated to the Museum in 1986</a>. They have never been on display. Anyway, here&apos;s what Graves did:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="aptinset.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809233058im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/aptinset.jpg" width="303" height="384"> <br> <i style=" width:303px; ;display:block"> Courtesy of the Brooklyn Museum</i></div> <blockquote>Part of a larger duplex, the suite consists of a library and child&#x2019;s bedroom. Built-in bookshelves, wall paneling, and multi-tiered ceilings define the rooms, forming a completely designed, cohesive interior recalling French boiserie in concept. The suite exemplifies Graves&#x2019; signature style of muted colors and abstracted classicism.<p></p>

<p>The Reinhold rooms are important as rare examples of postmodernist interior architecture; as a work by the recently deceased Michael Graves (1934-2015). While many important modernist residential interiors still exist in houses, few modernist apartment interiors survive, and the Reinhold rooms may be the only postmodernist ones.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The Reinholds&#x2014;also members of the art world&#x2014;were friends with Andy Warhol, who thought the process shouldn&apos;t have taken Graves so long. He wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809233058/https://books.google.com/books?id=OmBQv6Ib6tgC&amp;pg=PT994&amp;lpg=PT994&amp;dq=%22michael+graves%22+Reinhold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-iQyQmVgUb&amp;sig=Ash8F7bb1isQMopQsoaFidd76jo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwDGoVChMI8YWUvKjFyAIVyMo-Ch1GzQdO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22michael%20graves%22%20Reinhold&amp;f=false">in his published diaries</a>: </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="warholdrein15.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809233058im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/warholdrein15.jpg" width="640" height="200" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The rest of the apartment was designed by a number of other architects, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809233058/http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html">A.M. Stern</a>, who once had a great silver-lining comment on NYC apartments:</p><blockquote>&quot;Buy a city apartment and you are probably buying a box. But you can make a totally personal world inside that space. The only place this world has to touch what&apos;s really outside is at windows, doors, places where structural elements have to stay where they are.&#x201D;</blockquote>And we can all relate to that, even those of us who only have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809233058/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/28/video_woman_who_lived_in_90-square-.php">90-square-feet</a> to work with. <p></p>

<p>We reached out to the Brooklyn Museum to find out if they&apos;ll ever put Graves&apos;s work on display, and we&apos;ll update here if we hear back.
