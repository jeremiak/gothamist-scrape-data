<p>The Tex-Japanese &quot;craze,&quot; which we can blame <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095339/http://gothamist.com/tags/guyfieri">Guy Fieri</a> for, has made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095339/http://gothamist.com/tags/lobsterroll">the holy Lobster Roll</a> its latest victim. Listen, we&apos;re all for experimenting with food, but maybe if something is perfect we should just let it be?</p>

<p>You guys know how much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095339/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">we love ramps</a>, right? Well we don&apos;t even think <em>ramps</em> need to be added to a lobster roll. You know why? <em>There&apos;s already lobster. On the roll.</em> It doesn&apos;t need anything else! Yet here we are...</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095339/http://bistro33nyc.com/">Bistro 33 in Astoria</a> has made a new kind of lobster &quot;roll,&quot; featuring Japanese mayo, shichimi, red pepper powder, shredded cucumbers, lettuce, and massive slabs of Texas toast. The trustworthy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095339/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/2013/05/bistro-33s-tex-japanese-spin-on-the-lobster-roll/">Joe DiStefano seems to like it</a>, but we&apos;re sticking with the traditional &quot;less is more&quot; roll when shelling out $16. That is just <em>too much bread.</em></p>

<p>Other breads that don&apos;t need to be introduced to the lobster roll: paninis, wraps, pitas, doughnuts... WAIT A SECOND... no, no definitely not doughnuts, naan, tortillas, crepes, bagels. We <em>will</em> however accept: cornbread, focaccia, and croissants.</p>
