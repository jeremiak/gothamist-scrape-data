</div></div><p>Anyone who&apos;s anyone is using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110416072148/http://gothamist.com/tags/lego">LEGO</a> bricks to recreate things these days. The latest LEGO creation is being built up right now at the Intrepid, where Ed Diment is constructing that 22-foot-long, 550-pound Intrepid model that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110416072148/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/the_intrepid_gets_legod.php">we&apos;ve heard</a> so much about. He began at 11 a.m., and these photos were just sent to us, so it looks like he&apos;s really just assembling a pre-constructed piece. Currently we&apos;re told Diment is teaching a visiting group of first grade students from Metropolitan Lighthouse Charter School in the Bronx how to build smaller structures, but once class is dismissed he&apos;ll go back to the big task at hand, which he&apos;ll complete sometime tomorrow. </p>

<p>The big question, however, is <em>will there be a LEGO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110416072148/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/12/shuttle_enterpise_is_coming_to_the.php">Enterprise</a>?</em> A rep for the Intrepid tells us, &quot;We can only hope!&quot;</p>
