<p>If you thought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001351/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/billy_corgan_interview.php">Billy Corgan</a> was the most unlikely candidate to get into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001351/http://www.resistancepro.com/">the professional wrestling scene</a>, then look no further than 1985, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001351/http://gothamist.com/tags/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a> turned up on camera with some of the World Wrestling Federation&apos;s biggest names of the time.  </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001351/http://www.openculture.com/2013/01/andy_warhol_at_professional_wrestling_extravaganza.html">Open Culture</a>, the artist actually &quot;frequented wrestling shows at Madison Square Garden during the 1970s,&quot; so at the time the appearance happened wrestletainment was already in his life.</p>

<p>Below, watch Mean Gene Okerlund interview the artist about the rock and wrestling connection backstage at MSG, following &quot;The War to Settle the Score.&quot; Warhol quietly declares, &quot;It&apos;s the best I&apos;ve seen in my entire life, the most exciting thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429001351/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_to_Settle_the_Score">The War to Settle the Score</a>&quot; was a New York-only professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now the WWE) which was broadcast live on MTV. The throwdown took place on February 18th, 1985 at MSG, and featured Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Cyndi Lauper, Mr. T and Captain Lou Albano.</p>
