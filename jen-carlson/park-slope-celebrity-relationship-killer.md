										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="jaketay0111.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815203014im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/jaketay0111.jpg" width="200" height="247" class="image-left"> </span>Did Park Slope break up Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift? The two dated briefly, but now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815203014/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20454920,00.html">People</a> reports that they&apos;ve already called it quits. We blame their decision to take the relationship <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815203014/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/25/jg_ts_spotted_in_park_slope.php">to the Park Slope level</a> a bit too soon. The neighborhood has traditionally been filled with celebrity couples that are really <em>there</em>, you know? A Jennifer Connelly and a Paul Bettany, a Maggie Gyllenhaal and a Peter Sarsgaard... these are couples who are ready for Park Slope. The strollers, the brownstones, the Co-op... there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815203014/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/taylor-swift-n-jake-gyllenhaal-shop-at-union-market.html">a lot of pressure there</a>, this is grown up stuff! </p>

<p>In reality, Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal should have still been in the Manhattan phase&#x2014;a dinner date tipped to the paparazzi, a walk around the West Village in cable knit sweaters holding soy lattes from Starbucks and laughing to each other in that special way only the rich and famous get to do... this was more their speed. </p>

<p>At least this otherwise ill-fated Park Slope route may have put the tween-friendly Swift on the fast track to her fated musical end-point: adult contemporary.</p>
