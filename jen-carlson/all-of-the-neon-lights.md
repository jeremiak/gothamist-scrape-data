<p>When is the last time you stopped to bask in the glow of the city&apos;s neon lights? Whether they&apos;re flickering, busted, or shiny and new, Kirsten Hively is documenting what she dubs &quot;New York&apos;s best neon signs.&quot; Check out all of her photos (each with a story) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145921/http://projectneon.tumblr.com/">Project Neon</a>. Personally, we like the ones advertising cheap booze... or nice fonts.</p>

<p>Hively says: &quot;I wanted to demonstrate (mostly to myself) that the quirky, independent New York is still here&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not all chain stores, standard-issue vinyl awnings and luxury condos. I love neon signs that have a sense of place, that feel unique and evidence their handmade origins. The glow, the colors, the hum when you get close, the flicker when they need repair. They are lively and engaging. They are landmarks, or even icons. A familiar sign can seem like a helpful friend in the dark of the city at night.&quot;</p>

<p>If you know of a sign you believe deserves documenting, send her a tip!</p>
