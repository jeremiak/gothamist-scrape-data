</div></div>					<p>A home in the Adirondacks State Park in Upstate New York may just be the hottest piece of real estate on the market this year, if you believe the Mayans. The home, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728174258/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-perfect-house-for-surviving-a-zombie-apocalyps">Buzzfeed</a> says is &quot;The Perfect House For Surviving A Zombie Apocalypse,&quot; is going for just $1.75 million, which is nothing once you find out what&apos;s locked away inside. </p>

<p>The house includes 2,000 square feet of space in the proper housing unit <em>above ground</em>, but then there&apos;s the basement, locked behind a keypad entry and offering up 2,300 square feet of space... and <em>peace of mind</em>. The cabin, you see, was actually built on top of a cold-war era missile silo, and will save your ass when the End of Days comes for us all.</p>

<p>You can take a more expansive tour of the property, which includes a runway and artificial lighting, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150728174258/http://bestplaces.nydailynews.com/galleries/take-tour-home-built-missile-silo">right here</a>. Just clicking through it makes us feel safe. Also, this is the perfect time to call back the best movie ever about bomb shelters: <em>Blast From The Past</em>.</p>
