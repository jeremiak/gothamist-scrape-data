<p>In 1914, a group of artists&#x2014;including John Sloan and Marcel Duchamp&#x2014;climbed the spiral staircase <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152455/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/another_inside_look_at_the_washingt.php">inside the Washington Arch</a> and gained access to the roof. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152455/http://nyc-architecture.com/GV/GV046WashingtonSquareArch.htm">Once there</a>, they lit a bonfire and read a resolution proclaiming the Republic of Greenwich Village, and then they toasted with champagne. </p>

<p>The roof of the arch seems like a good place for such a highbrow rebellion, the sort of spot a gaggle of men sporting rugby scarves and a bullhorn (or the Dead Poets Society) would meet. In fact, the two men in this photo&#x2014;taken by a tipster in 2009&#x2014;kind of look like they were scoping out the roof for a secret society scroll-reading ritual to happen later in the evening.</p>

<p>Sadly, the roof (as well as the interior) is closed off to the public, so you really do need a nice mixture of peer pressure, champagne, and rebellious tendencies to get up there. But as explained to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152455/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703386704576186622072300888.html">the WSJ</a> years ago, &quot;The roof is quite fragile. If we allowed the public up here, the roof would fail quite quickly.&quot;</p>
