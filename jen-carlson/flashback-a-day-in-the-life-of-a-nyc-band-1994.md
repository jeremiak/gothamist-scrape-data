<p>As you can see in this photo, 1994 was a confusing time&#x2014;you were either going to go full grunge, or you were white knuckling onto your &apos;80s fashion sensibilities. Let&apos;s go back for a moment: Bill Clinton was in office, <em>Schindler&apos;s List</em> would practically sweep the Oscars, Woodstock &apos;94 would deliver us the gift that was Trent Reznor covered in mud playing <em>Closer</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608061459/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEdqqyxoWuA">revisit now</a>, we&apos;ll wait), Pearl Jam would go after Ticketmaster, Jeff Buckley would release his full-length studio album <em>Grace</em>, ice hockey would become Canada&apos;s official winter sport (what was it before, curling?), and Kurt Cobain would be found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound just 16 days after this photo was taken.</p>

<p>On March 20th, 1994, on 9th Avenue (somewhere between 47th and 49th Street), the Dimestore Darlings were shooting the cover for their <em>Sunrise Semester</em> album. The band (full disclosure: one of the members went on to marry Gothamist&apos;s Jen Chung) has recently put up some of their past <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608061459/http://dimestoredarlings.tumblr.com/">on Tumblr</a>; that&apos;s Aaron Conte on the left (formerly of Nada Surf), and yes, that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608061459/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005095/">Justin Kirk</a> in the middle. You can check out some of their songs on the site&#x2014;at this time they were playing venues like Spiral and CBGBs (RIP).</p>
