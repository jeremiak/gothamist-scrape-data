<p>David Lynch is putting down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302021934/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/david_lynch_is_obsessed_with.php">the coffee cup</a> and bringing an art exhibition to New York next week. This is his first solo show in the city since 1989, right before <em>Twin Peaks</em> hit the small screen, and it will be hosted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302021934/http://www.jacktiltongallery.com/">Tilton Gallery</a> (Lynch is long time friend&apos;s with the owner, Jack). According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302021934/http://www.galleristny.com/2012/02/david-lynch-plans-first-new-york-gallery-exhibit-since-1989/">Gallerist</a>, the show will feature gold-framed (in the style of Francis Bacon) paintings, sculpture, works on paper, photographs, and a 42-second film. The works are all &quot;fairly recent,&quot; created between 2009 and 2012.</p>

<p>Jack Tilton&apos;s wife told the site, &#x201C;I remember we visited him at his studio twenty years ago. They&#x2019;ve been talking for a while and it just seemed like the right time to everyone. We&#x2019;re thrilled. It&#x2019;s going to be a fantastic show.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The show opens March 6th, and there will be an artist&#x2019;s reception on March 16th. Tilton Gallery is located at 8 East 76 Street.</p>
