They say this &quot;very special summer cocktail&quot; is just for the ladies...which could be taken as an insult considering it&apos;s called <em>the Gold Digger</em>. Before the sparkle is added, here&apos;s what you get:</p><blockquote>2 oz Zuidam Gin<br>
&#xBD; oz. Dry Vermouth<br>
Served in a martini glass</blockquote>What makes the cocktail worth your (or presumably, some investment banker&apos;s) hard earned 50 bucks? Gold of course! It&apos;s the...gold standard of novelty menu items. This one, more specifically, promises &quot;gold-wrapped olives and a golden spear designed by Rick Toscano.&quot; Though the photo seems to show flakes and a glorified wooden toothpick. Dare we say the same result could come from a bottle of Goldschl&#xE4;ger?<p></p>

<p>Imbibers that are okay with ordering the unfortunately-named drink might even consider enjoying one with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901170448/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/09/affordable_gold.php">a gold Twinkie</a> for the ultimate in decadent wining and dining.</p>
