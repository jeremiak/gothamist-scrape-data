What did Santa bring her? An apartment in the West Village! So really, it&apos;s like a present for us all. She stated, in perfectly readable English:</p><blockquote>i think/hope we foundteh PERFECT plaCE, its a w village 4 floor house 2 floors are being rented by the owners, itllcost ...alot...to returjn it to a house biut fbc doesnt need to have all that space til she moves here at 18 and its a great invesment. </blockquote>Translation: C.Lo, or just her daughter Frances Bean...or both(!), are moving to the city. <p></p>

Plenty of time to kick out the current tenants and &quot;returjn it to a house.&quot; Don&apos;t feel bad for those tenants though, there was a 99% chance they would have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063338/http://gothamist.com/2004/07/10/courtney_love_finally_goes_to_bellevue.php">hit by bottles</a> if they were able to stay.<br>
