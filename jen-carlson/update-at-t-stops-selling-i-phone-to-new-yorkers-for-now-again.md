You don&apos;t have enough towers to handle the phone.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205115938/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/18/att_ceo_sets_off_iphone_rebellion.php">Earlier this month</a> AT&amp;T;&apos;s CEO Ralph de la Vega admitted to problems in New York and other metropolitan areas, asking &quot;bandwidth hogs&quot; to limit their usage and hinting at a future of usage-based pricing. </p>

<p>An AT&amp;T; spokesman told Consumerist that they &quot;periodically modify our promotions and distribution channels&quot; &#x2014; but did not go into details. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205115938/http://mashable.com/2009/12/27/att-iphones-new-york-city/">Mashable</a> notes that at one point the online rep &quot;Daphne&quot; said they stopped accepting online orders in NYC due to fraud. We&apos;re guessing AT&amp;T;&apos;s PR company is working hard this morning!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the phones are currently available at the Apple stores in New York.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> AT&amp;T;&apos;s website is once again selling iPhones to New Yorkers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160205115938/http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20091228/nyc-iphone-fraud-epidemic-solved-att-web-site-selling-iphones-to-new-yorkers-again/">Digital Daily</a> reports that at one point customer service reps were blaming &#x201C;online fraudulent activity&#x201D; for their decision to halt sales in the city, but have failed to give any details as to what this fraud entailed. They also had reps going with the aforementioned &quot;not enough towers&quot; explanation. The site suggests the &quot;entire incident may have been one of those middle-of-the-org-chart missteps that went unnoticed by upper management until it blew up in the media.&quot; For now, AT&amp;T; is still keeping mum.</p>
