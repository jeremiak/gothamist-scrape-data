title: Kickstarter Campaign Wants To Bring Back NYC Public Access, Sort Of
---

	
										<p>NYC&apos;s Public Access glory days are behind us, but there&apos;s a trio of millennials currently trying to resurrect the passion of Channel J. Nostalgia for an era you never really experienced is truly is a powerful thing. </p>

<p>Instead of mentioning the old guard of beloved public access characters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818061213/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1353146397/nyctv-an-independent-platform-backing-nyc-video-an">their Kickstarter</a> pitch video is sprinkled with quick clips featuring Keyboard Cat and Wayne&apos;s World, along with declarations that they want to create one ultimate and &quot;curated digital destination&quot; hub. </p>

<p>And is that pizza a reference to how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818061213/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110950/">Michael Graves</a> butchered Lelaina Pierce&apos;s would-be public access reality television series?</p>

<p>Their overall goal for what they&apos;re calling NYCTV <em>is</em> worthy, however&#x2014;they aim to create &quot;a video-only platform inspired by public access, dedicated to creating, promoting, and distributing video created by New Yorkers.&quot; And while this mostly just seems like a curated, NY-centric YouTube channel, it could be pretty cool if done right... though let&apos;s not forget that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818061213/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/media/about/about.page">NYC Media</a>, MNN, QPTV, BCAT, SICTV, and BronxNet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818061213/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public-access_TV_stations_in_the_United_States_(Nebraska%E2%80%93Pennsylvania)#New_York">still exist</a>.</p>

<p>And let&apos;s face it, it will never be like it used to be...</p>
