<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ipadcade.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508221101im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ipadcade.jpg" width="200" height="173" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508221101/http://gothamist.com/tags/ipad">iPad cometh</a>, even if you don&apos;t want it to. Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508221101/http://gizmodo.com/5507491/the-ipad-app-store-is-live">Gizmodo</a> they excitedly announced today that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508221101/http://ax.search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search?entity=k2software&amp;media=all&amp;restrict=true&amp;submit=seeAllLockups&amp;term=ipad">the app store</a> for the gadget is now open (their first impressions: &quot;So many apps! Also: <em>So expensive</em>&quot;).</p>

<p>But really.... apps? <em>Yawn</em>. What about turning your iPad into an old time arcade game? Because you totally can do that for just an extra $149! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508221101/http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/iCade.shtml?icpg=Carousel_iCade_1">ThinkGeek</a>&apos;s already got the iPad Arcade Cabinet for sale, along with a few notes from the creators, who ask, &quot;How cool would it be to slide your iPad into a desktop-sized arcade cabinet and rock it old school with some Pac-Man or Space Invaders?&quot; Alas, you <em>will</em> need the iCade App (which is free!) to get it to work.</p>

<p>We contacted Barcade owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508221101/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/08/paul_kermizian.php">Paul Kermizian</a> to see if he thinks the iPad can stand up to the real deal vintage arcade games at his bar. He told us, &quot;I don&apos;t think desktop Tapper would be as good without the brass foot rail.&quot; But what do <em>you</em> think?</p>

<p>Psst: no, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508221101/http://www.thinkgeek.com/42.shtml?qty=1&amp;cart.x=61&amp;cart.y=27"><em>it&apos;s not real</em></a> (though it probably should be).</p>
