The play is directed by David Cromer and stars some faces we&apos;re more used to seeing on the small screen&#x2014;Zosia Mamet (<em>Girls</em>) and Matt Lauria (<em>Parenthood</em>, <em>Friday Night Lights</em>) are at the center of the story. Without giving too much away, the play focuses on a small group of college friends who quickly and violently come apart at the seams... reminding us all that <em>everyone is terrible</em> and anything  Zen you learned in Philosophy 101 is difficult to apply in real life.<p></p>

<p>Last week we spoke with Lauria on the phone as he shopped in Uniqlo during the snow storm; at the time, the play had just been extended through March 30th.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: our recorder malfunctioned just as we started talking about Connie Britton and how everyone in <em>Really Really</em> is obsessed with her new show <em>Nashville</em>.</p>

<p><strong>I saw the play during previews... It&apos;s pretty intense, is it really emotionally draining to be that person seven times a week?</strong> It is very demanding physically and emotionally. You know, the posture that my character has is like hunched over and leaning forward on my toes... so it&apos;s pretty physically demanding that way. [Emotionally] I&apos;ve gotten better at shaking it off at the end of the night, but last night I had a friend come... I always leave talking to them outside the theater feeling, &quot;Did they think I was a weirdo right now, was I engaging, was I there?&quot; You know it takes a second to shake off. But I think it&apos;s more that I can&apos;t let go of the play. When I&apos;m not there I&apos;m constantly thinking about it. Did it go well? How can I tweak it? What can I dig deeper on?</p>

<p><strong>What drew you to the role?</strong> You know, David Cromer was a huge influence in that decision, cause I&apos;d heard such great things about his work. I heard and read about his work, that is, I never had a chance to see any of it being on the West Coast. I read the play and I originally thought, &quot;Oh man, I don&apos;t know if I can do this. Can I do this?&quot; But I threw myself on tape for it and thought, &quot;Well, we&apos;ll just see what happens.&quot; And then when they wanted to see me for callbacks, despite my intimidation I dragged myself out to New York and did it. </p>

<p>That&apos;s a vague answer, but I guess the things that drew me to it were Cromer, and that I was very intimidated by the role and the play, and the other thing was Lauren Culpepper&apos;s speeches as [her character] Grace. They&apos;re one of the main things that drew me to it. I thought that [playwright] Paul [Downs Colaizzo] so succinctly articulated the problem that is the direction society is heading. It&apos;s this thing that shocks and scares me, and so I thought how funny that it&apos;s this tongue-in-cheek examination of where we&apos;re headed, and they&apos;re trying to pawn it off as something that&apos;s good, but we all know it&apos;s bad &quot;wink wink.&quot; It was this &quot;Generation Me&quot; concept. And I&apos;ve come to learn later that some people... Paul thinks this is where we&apos;re at, and these are in fact the strengths of it&#x2014;like Grace sort of talks about it in this celebratory manner. So I just thought that was such a unique perspective and something that nudged me out of my, sort of, predetermined notions about who we are and what we&apos;re doing, you know? I don&apos;t know, there was a lot of appeal in that aspect of the play. </p>

<p><strong>Have you worked with Zosia Mamet before, you were both on <em>Parenthood</em>, but at separate times...</strong> Yeah, so I never encountered her before. I was familiar with her work because my wife and I watch <em>Mad Men</em>. We still haven&apos;t caught up on the recent season, but... I remember her work from that, and I&apos;m a fan of <em>Girls</em>. I just thought she was making exciting and subtle choices in both roles, so I was excited for an opportunity to work with her. </p>

<p><strong>Could you see yourself making a cameo on <em>Girls</em>?</strong> [Laughs] I guess it&apos;s whether or not Lena Dunham could see me making a cameo on Girls... [Uniqlo saleswoman interrups] This lady just came over and was like, &quot;You good?&quot; I&apos;m squatted down in the corner. I should take a picture and send it to you.</p>

<p><strong>So, I saw you Tweeted recently something about being frustrated at the R train... do you want to talk about your experience with the city&apos;s mass transit system?</strong> Here&apos;s the thing, I used to live in Astoria, so we were on the W and N, back when the W was around, or feebly around on its last legs. And I had other buddies who lived a little east in Astoria, and I was always like, &quot;I think I&apos;d rather walk than try and take the freakin&apos; R train&quot; because it&apos;s so unreliable. And now I&apos;m staying in Brooklyn and my God it&apos;s like, I have to take it one stop and transfer to something that&apos;s better. But getting from that one point to the next is like, you know... I shouldn&apos;t jinx it because thus far I&apos;ve been somewhat smiled upon by the gods of transit. But as my roommate said, &quot;The R train is a wrathful god.&quot; The R train sucks, there&apos;s not much more to say about that. </p>

<p><strong>Do you have any interesting anecdotes from your time here, any &quot;only in New York&quot; stories?</strong> My buddy used to live up on 143rd and Broadway and I was going up to visit him. This was one of my first train experiences. He was like, &quot;Just take the 1 up to 145th and jump off.&quot; Because I thought I was so smart I thought, &quot;I&apos;ll take the express train.&quot; So I took the 2/3 up to 145th and got off. And I had been to his house before and I was like, &quot;Uhhh, none of this looks familiar. Oh no... this is not the right area.&quot; And as I&apos;m wandering around looking helpless, like &quot;Shit, what do I do?&quot; This gypsy cab pulls up and the guy goes, &quot;Get in! Where are you going?&quot; And I was like &quot;Um, I was supposed to get off the 1,&quot; and he&apos;s like &quot;I know where you&apos;re going I&apos;ll take you there.&quot; And I was like, &quot;No no dude, I don&apos;t have any money&quot;&#x2014;because I didn&apos;t, I literally had no money. And he&apos;s like &quot;I don&apos;t care get in! Get in the cab!&quot; He was so terrified for me, so he gave me a free ride across town and dropped me off, because he knew that I was probably in trouble. He saved me.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any tips on keeping in shape? In all of your roles you&apos;ve been very in shape...</strong> Oh this is embarrassing. [Laughs] I&apos;ve stayed away from gyms, I haven&apos;t been a member of a gym ever actually. Except when I moved here I got a 30 day trial at New York Sports Club, and I went maybe 6 or 7 times, but I&apos;m not motivated to do that. It&apos;s a little uninspiring. So what I just did, I started climbing as of three sessions ago, and that&apos;s a lot of fun. And I box a little. And mostly I just do a 30 minute work out in my house that involves push-ups and pull-ups, and I like to run, and that&apos;s pretty much it. </p>

<p><strong>Is <em>Parenthood</em> coming back for another season?</strong> You know I just read about it on Twitter this morning, or on TVLine.com... my manager sent me a link... the creative end of things seemed hopeful. And Jason [Katims] has said he&apos;d like to have me back should I be available, and I&apos;m like, &quot;Wow, glad you think so highly of my schedule. It&apos;s nice to be perceived as very hard to get.&quot; [Laughs] Mae is just simply the best to work with, she&apos;s so much fun. </p>

<p><strong>It seems like you&apos;ve worked with a lot of amazing women. I love Connie Britton...</strong> Oh my gosh, yes...</p>

<p>[RECORDER MALFUNCTION! Everything really <em>is</em> terrible.]</p>
