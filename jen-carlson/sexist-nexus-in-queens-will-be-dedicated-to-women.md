<span class="photo_caption">(via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913194620/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Virtue_(sculpture)#/media/File:CivicVirtueStatueKewGardens.jpg">Wikipedia</a>)</span></p>

<p>A Queens plaza that was once home to the controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913194620/http://gothamist.com/tags/CivicVirtue">Triumph of Civic Virtue</a> statue will now be dedicated to women, thanks to Queens Borough President Melinda Katz. </p>

<p>The statue, which some felt portrayed women (the sirens Vice and Corruption) being trampled by a naked man, has been around since the 1920s. In 1941 it was banished to Queens from Manhattan by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, and in 2012 was moved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913194620/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/green-wood_cemetery_wants_to_offer.php">to Green-Wood Cemetery</a>. LaGaurdia took issue with the statue, which at the time sat outside of City Hall, because he didn&apos;t like seeing what he called the &quot;Fat Boy&apos;s&quot; naked butt every day. History!</p>

<p>The decaying plaza at Queens Blvd. and Union Turnpike in Queens will now get a $720,000 makeover, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913194620/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/decaying-queens-plaza-transformed-plaza-honoring-women-article-1.2625709">the Daily News</a>, which should be completed by next spring. This will include new landscaping and benches. </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear how women will be worked into the redesign, but Katz stated: &#x201C;This restoration project will create a fitting tribute in a prominent location in our borough&#x2019;s civic center, dedicated to the women of Queens. The site will soon host a visible, meaningful tribute to the women of Queens and become a public space utilized and enjoyed by all.&#x201D; Hopefully this will include a female statue.</p>

<p>Somehow, in 2016, there are only a handful of statues portraying real women. Specifically, of the 150ish historical statues in all of New York City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913194620/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/12/statues_in_nyc.php#photo-1">there are five</a>: Joan of Arc was the first, and the others are Eleanor Roosevelt, Gertrude Stein, Golda Mier, and Harriet Tubman&#x2014;who was the last one, put up in 2007. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913194620/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/13/nyc_women_statues.php">There are 0 in Central Park</a>.</p>

<p>The project, announced this week, should be completed by next spring, officials said.</p>
