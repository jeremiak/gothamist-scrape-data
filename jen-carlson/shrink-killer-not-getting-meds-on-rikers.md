<p>Tarloff was arrested on February 16th, and moved from Bellevue Hospital Center to Rikers (under protective custody) on March 14th. Now his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152725/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/18/cleaver_killer.php">(new) court-appointed attorney</a>, Bryan Konoski, has said, &quot;we&apos;re extremely unhappy with the way the hospital suddenly released David Tarloff into the custody of Rikers Island, and we&apos;re currently investigating whether or not we have any recourse. It is my understanding that he hasn&apos;t been given his proper medicine and, at times, has not been given medication at all.&quot; </p>

<p>Konoski also notes that Tarloff, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425152725/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/23/accused_cleaver.php">found fit to stand trial</a>, was getting better while at Bellevue. The city Department of Health has yet to speak out, and Bellevue cited privacy laws when asked for a comment.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Tarloff&apos;s arraignment has been postponed to April 1st. He is being held on charges of first and second-degree murder, second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and first-degree attempted robbery.</p>
