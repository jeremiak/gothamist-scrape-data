                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="319frost14.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102340im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/319frost14.jpg" width="640" height="476" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Rumors of a massive new venue in East Williamsburg have been going around since late last year, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102340/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131206/east-williamsburg/2000-person-music-venue-looking-open-e-williamsburg-steel-factory">DNAInfo</a> reported that a warehouse at 319 Frost Street would be transformed into a 2,000-capacity live music destination. And behind it all is Jim Glancy, former president of the New York division of Live Nation, who joined Bowery Presents in 2006. Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102340/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/massive-music-hall-set-east-williamsburg-article-1.1581244">the Daily News</a> reports that it&apos;s his name tied to an application <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102340/http://www.nyc.gov/html/bkncb1/downloads/pdf/combined_public_hearing_and_board_meeting_notice_11-13-13.pdf">under Frobo LLC</a> for a liquor license for the building.</p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, the former warehouse will become The Brooklyn Classic, because branding your thing with the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; name is still happening. And to give you an idea of how huge this place would be, it holds over 3 times the number of people that Music Hall of Williamsburg does. </p>

<p>Right now no one is really commenting on the venture, whose future is in the hands of Community Board 1, but one neighbor in the area is opposed to venue, telling the Daily News, &quot;It&#x2019;s going to bring a lot of drunks to the neighborhood, and I&#x2019;m not excited about that either. There are a lot of kids who live in this area, and this sort of stuff is going to influence the kids.&#x201D;</p>
