<p>Last night the second season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316014229/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a> ended, and... it was sort of a relief. Shit got <em>real</em> this season, dark and weird and a little bit disjointed&#x2014;one second we&apos;re at an adorable stoop sale and making bundt cake puns and the next it&apos;s all OCD and bloody ear canals. The characters also changed a lot, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316014229/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/zosia_mamet.php">Zosia Mamet pointed out</a> to us last week, &quot;Lena&apos;s sort of following the natural trajectory of people in their twenties, it&apos;s sort of a slow decline into darkness.&quot; Maybe the manic, all-over-the-place feel of this season was just representative of that, but mostly it feels like we just walked out of a theater showing a blissed-out rom com spliced in with Dunham&apos;s first film, <em>Tiny Furniture</em>. It still had some great moments, though&#x2014;let&apos;s all hold hands and revisit them!</p>

<p><strong>The Thomas-John and Jessa Break-Up</strong>: &quot;I&apos;m a needle in the haystack... and you&apos;re just some fucking dumb hipster who&apos;s munching my hay.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Hannah and Sandy Break-Up</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hannah&apos;s Lost Weekend With Patrick Wilson</strong>: &quot;Please don&apos;t tell anyone this, but I want to be happy. I didn&apos;t think that <em>I did.</em> I made a promise such a long time ago that I was going to take in experiences, all of them, so I could tell other people about them and make me save them. But it gets so tiring, trying to take in all the experiences for everybody, letting anyone say anything to me. Then I came here, and I see you... and you&apos;ve got the fruit in the bowl and the fridge with the stuff. And I realize I&apos;m not different, I want what everyone wants, I want what they all want, I want all the things. I just want to be happy.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Duncan Sheik Torture Art Chamber</strong>: When this aired <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316014229/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/28/barely_breathing.php">we asked</a> Mr. Sheik what he thought about his song &quot;Barely Breathing&quot; being used as a tool of torture.</p>

<p><strong>The One Where They Spoofed XOJane</strong>:  &quot;Here&apos;s your comfort zone... THIS is where the magic happens.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Marnie Singing Kanye</strong>: Marnie finally lets loose! Sadly, the finale suggests her spinning into the downward spiral is ending, but we have a feeling this isn&apos;t the last time we&apos;ll see Marnie on the dark side.</p>
