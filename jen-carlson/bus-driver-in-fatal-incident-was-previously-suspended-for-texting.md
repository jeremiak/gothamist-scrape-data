Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928091107/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/11/09/2009-11-09_driver_flunked_text_had_just_returned_to_bus_job_when_vehicle_killed_student.html">the Daily News</a> reports on the bus driver&apos;s history.</p>

<p>Allegedly the 39-year-old NYC Transit driver Jeremy Philhower &quot;was suspended weeks before the accident and the agency had begun disciplinary proceedings to fire him.&quot; While investigators don&apos;t believe he was using his phone at the time of the accident, they do say that he often used it &quot;<strong>to post disparaging comments about his passengers to Facebook while on duty</strong>.&quot; Instead of being let go, however, he was simply sent to driver safety and customer service training courses. His first day back on the job was last Wednesday.</p>

<p>Philhower&apos;s family say he is distraught, but at Kahn&apos;s funeral yesterday the victim&apos;s friends and family declared: &quot;he should have never been allowed to drive people around. It&apos;s not right. <strong>I can&apos;t believe a bus driver would be updating Facebook when he&apos;s supposed to be giving all his attention to driving. It&apos;s so outrageous.</strong>&quot;</p>
