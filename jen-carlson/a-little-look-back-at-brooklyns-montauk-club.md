</div></div>					<p>The Montauk Club is a private social club in Park Slope that&apos;s been around since the late 1800s&#x2014;founded by Charles Pratt, Richard Schermerhorn, and Edwin C. Litchfield in 1889. In later years, it would come to host prominent political figures like Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. And over the past few years or so, it&apos;s come back to life with a strong focus on Brooklyn&apos;s under-35 set. To enter, you must be a member, and each month the Club approves new applications. They explain on their website, &quot;The majority of our under 35s are unmarried&#x2014;and in keeping with Brooklyn&#x2019;s reputation&#x2014;good looking. But our older members are holding their own and the mix of ages and the diversity of points of view make for engaging conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>If you aren&apos;t turned off by what seems to be a focus on looks, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016100735/http://montaukclub.com/membership/">apply here</a>&#x2014;dues are actually pretty low in comparison to some of New York City&apos;s other social clubs, starting at around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016100735/http://montaukclub.com/membership/membership-fees/">$350 a year</a>. Sadly, membership doesn&apos;t include access to a time machine that can bring you back to the days when JFK was mingling inside, but here&apos;s a look courtesy of the New York Public Library&apos;s old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016100735/http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/index.cfm">image archive</a>.</p>
