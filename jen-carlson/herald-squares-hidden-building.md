</div></div>					<p>Did you think there were gifts in that giant shopping bag off the side of the Macy&apos;s in Herald Square? Well, there are <em>not</em> oversized gifts, not for you, <em>not for anybody</em>. There is, however, a nice five-story building, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141003102410/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/the-tiny-holdout-building-in-the-middle-of-macys/">Ephemeral NY</a> has the details. </p>

<p>The site notes that &quot;old photos reveal a five-story building sticking out like a sore thumb in front of the world&#x2019;s most iconic department store.&quot; If you knew there was a building under Macy&apos;s changing adornments there, the interesting part of the story is that Macy&apos;s doesn&apos;t own it, and it&apos;s &quot;one of the most famous &apos;holdouts&apos; in New York real estate history.&quot; </p>

<p>The site goes on to explain that around 1900 Macy&apos;s began acquiring land in the Herald Square area, and had a verbal agreement to buy a plot on the corner of 34th and Broadway, but an agent acting on behalf of a rival department store, Siegel-Cooper, got the plot instead. They offered it to Macy&apos;s in exchange for their 14th Street store, but that offer was declined. Siegel-Cooper built their 5-story building in 1903, and Macy&apos;s built up their massive store around it!</p>

<p>Of course, not long after this real estate war, Isidor Straus&#x2014;co-owner with brother Nathan of R.H. Macy &amp; Co.&#x2014;lost her life during the Titanic tragedy.</p>
