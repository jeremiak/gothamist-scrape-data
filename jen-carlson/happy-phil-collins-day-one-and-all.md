<p>Valentine&apos;s Day is <em>so over</em>&#x2014;the real holiday worth celebrating this month is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304182252/http://gothamist.com/tags/philcollinsday">Phil Collins Day</a>, which is TODAY (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304182252/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/27/are_you_ready_for_phil_collins_day.php">don&apos;t say we didn&apos;t warn you</a>). Instead of seeing heart shaped balloons filling up the subway cars, there will be inflated Phil Collins heads bopping around... at least, that&apos;s the dream. We&apos;re not quite there yet, this is only the 6th annual celebration of the man, and so far Hallmark has refused to acknowledge the holiday with sappy cards.</p>

<p>For now, organizer Heather Feather (<em>if that&apos;s even her real name</em>) told us: &quot;This year there will be a Phil Collins confessional booth, upon which people will design masks, enter the booth with their secrets in hand, and reveal them to the camera. The confidential footage will be sent to Phil Collins himself, a man who truly understands the trials, tribulations and trueness of love, and puts them to a good beat.&quot;</p>

<p>Head over to 60 Freeman Street between noon and 10 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304182252/http://www.philcollinsday.com/">to record your message</a>. We wonder how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304182252/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUytEXTdx9A">Patrick Bateman</a> is celebrating.</p>
