<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621082731/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a>&apos;s scandal, and his attempt to come back from it, is the focus of a new documentary coming to the big and small screens this May, called <em>Weiner</em>. From dick pics to Democratic debates, the feature length film follows his 2013 attempt to become the city&apos;s Mayor, against all odds, and with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621082731/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner_sexting_scandals#Later_events">more sexting scandals</a> surfacing.</p>

<p>Directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg will take you inside Weiner&apos;s campaign&#x2014;from the heated interactions, to the rock-bottom moments (&quot;This is the worst, doing a documentary on my scandal...&quot;), to his attempts to just be an everyman on a Citi Bike.</p>

<p><em>Weiner</em> hits theaters on May 20th and VOD on the 26th.</p>
