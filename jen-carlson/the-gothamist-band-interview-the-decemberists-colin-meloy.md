Nautical, because for whatever reason, we cannot listen to this band without picturing pirates, the high seas and fair maidens from other centuries being battled for. The leader of this maritime troupe, Colin Meloy, spins tall tales with lexical gold and we all wait with baited breath to watch it come together. </p>

<p>Their latest release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151106162119/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007M22S4/qid=1124110032/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-8386738-2492018?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846"><em>Picaresque</em></a> delivers gem after gem of epic songcrafting, making it one of those rare albums we can listen to straight through (and repeatedly, at that). If we were castaway on a desert island with only one band to listen to, we&apos;d pick the Decemberists.</p>

<p>Recently Colin Meloy was kind enough to answer some of our questions. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate? Is it the month, the Russian revolutionary group...?</strong><br>
A little bit of both. &apos;Decembrist&apos; is the accepted English translation of the Russian&apos;Dekabristy.&apos; We appropriated it by adding the extra E, which, in my opinion, made it a better band name. For whatever reason.</p>

<p><strong>You guys always seem to have some unique group photographs, are they usually the idea of someone in the band?</strong><br>
We started doing that almost immediately. Our first photo shoot consists of a bunch of black and white shots of us standing around on the rooftop of a warehouse I once lived in. It was strange, boring and uncomfortable.  I swore to myself that I&apos;d never endure another such photo shoot.<br>
<strong><br>
Has there been any news on the stolen gear?</strong><br>
Some of it has trickled in -- a drum kit here,a guitar there. The case is still open, apparently, though we&apos;ve all made an effort to move on.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York?</strong><br>
Favorite: Running drunkenly through 3 feet of snow after playing a solo show at Fez last February,jumping in a cab with friends and watching the cabbie, who&apos;d never driven in snow before, inch his way uptown through the empty, snow covered streets.</p>

<p>Least: Ending up in Queens for the second time in my life late at night after jumping on the wrong train.  Not to say that I&apos;m worldly or anything -- I&apos;m not, really -- but I&apos;ve ridden on many of the world&apos;s metro systems and I have to say that the NYC subway makes the least amount of sense.</p>
