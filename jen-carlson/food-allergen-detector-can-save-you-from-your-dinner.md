<p>This video is sort of like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172612/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTZvnAF7UsA">that Cymbalta commercial</a>, but with a side of food... <em>that you can&apos;t eat</em> since you are probably allergic to it. But the good news is the Food Allergen Detector featured in it can tell you if that bowl of mystery soup will kill you. </p>

<p>Erik Borg&apos;s detector can decipher a dinner you ordered and tell you if there&apos;s anything you&apos;re allergic to hidden away in it. And that can save you, even if it can&apos;t pay for that uneaten peanut-soaked steak. This can also be used when your husband&apos;s new mysterious lady friend shows up at your house in the middle of the day with a plate of brownies that are probably stuffed with carefully grounded up tree nut dust because she knows you&apos;re allergic to them and wants you out of the picture. Check it out in action below:</p>
