Together the trio spins a mixture of tunes you aren&apos;t likely going to hear at any other dance party, and when these guys are together...there usually <em>is</em> a dance party. Currently residing at the Lucky Cat in Brooklyn for their Friday night parties the collective has recently been guest deejaying on the other side of the bridge as well, at parties like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202161145/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/02/27/totally_unsafe.php">Rated X</a>. </p>

<p>On par with their deejay skills is their ability to plan a party in approximately 12 minutes. Give them a piece of string and a blade of grass and they&apos;ll create a bash you won&apos;t soon recover from (the MacGyver&apos;s of party planners, if you will). Just this past week they created an Afterparty for the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202161145/http://Voxrot.net/">Voxrot</a> out of practically nothing, check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202161145/http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=21842430&amp;blogID=109156683&amp;MyToken=03f18eda-62d1-47fb-80ed-f6f4305b64dc">pictures here</a>. Now, sit back, crack open a Sparks and learn a little bit about the boys behind the (deejay)booth...</p>

<p><strong>You run a weekly party at Lucky Cat in Brooklyn...what can one expect at one of these parties?</strong><br>
<strong>TD:</strong> Lots of people making out.  Seriously, there is non stop necking and dancing.<br>
<strong>NF:</strong> There are usually three things: drinking dancing and making out</p>

<p><strong>Where did you come up with the name Finger on the Pulse? </strong><br>
<strong>TD:</strong> DJ Never Forget<br>
<strong>NF:</strong> When Never Forget was living in Oregon, he tried to throw an all indie dance party. Party needed name so I took it from the Bloc Party song, Like Eating Glass, which i was listening to on repeat. It represents our love for new music and finding the best songs. The party failed, but i love d the name, so when I moved out here i asked if we could call our party that. BD and TD didn&apos;t give a fuck so it stuck.</p>

<p><strong>What do you each bring to the (turn)table?</strong><br>
<strong>TD:</strong> Some hot soul jams and garage. Lots of fist pumping and a variation of three  dance moves.<br>
<strong>NF:</strong> Never Forget: dance punk, remixes, guilty 90s pleasures, new music.</p>

<p><strong>Will you, in fact, play the hits for money?</strong><br>
<strong>TD:</strong> No.  I have gone on record about this. Next question!<br>
<strong>BD:</strong> Only for Brunnnskiis</p>

<p><strong>At least two of you have a very unique fist pumping dance move...when/how was this created?</strong><br>
<strong>TD:</strong> Back in college I used to do this move called the punching bag.  It was a double fist pump over my head.  Now that I have grown up it has been reformed to a single pump fist at chest level. Think of it like this: pogoing is to the Sex Pistols as fist pumping is to Finger on the Pulse.<br>
<strong>NF:</strong> When i was in high school i used to have this swirling finger move<br>
that i did over my head when i listend to ska. as i got lazy i moved it down to my side and closed the fist.</p>

<p><strong>What is the earliest hour in which you&apos;ve cracked open your first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202161145/http://www.sparks.com/">Sparks</a> of the day/night?</strong><br>
<strong>TD:</strong> Noon / 3am<br>
<strong>NF:</strong> Does Drinking a sparks at 5 am count?</p>

<p><strong>If you could put on a party anywhere in this city, where would it be, and what could we expect?</strong> <br>
<strong>TD:</strong> Rooftop in Brooklyn, spring time. Expect lots of kegs and whiskey. Then, with the sun rising, expect me to make all of you pancakes with a reduced Sparks syrup.<br>
<strong>NF:</strong> I want to do a huge Williamsburg rooftop party in August. There would be music till the sun came up, sparks showers and half clothes people everywhere.<br>
<strong>BD:</strong> Chloe Sevigny&apos;s loft. Panties bunched. Briefs unfurled. Milk spilling.</p>
