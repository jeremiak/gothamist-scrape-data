</div></div>					<p>Between 1984 and 1986, the Statue of Liberty underwent a massive makeover&#x2014;her first big restoration since having landed on Liberty Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141621/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/17/statue.php#photo-1">in 1886</a>. The public was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141621/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/nyregion/statue-of-liberty-will-be-closed-for-restoration-in-1984-for-as-long-as-a-year.html">informed in 1982</a> that the statue would be completely closed to the public during this time. While no cosmetic changes were made during the process, Lady Liberty&apos;s torch was replaced&#x2014;on October 8th, 1984 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141621/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/08/nyregion/new-torch-of-liberty-to-be-built-by-french.html">the NY Times</a> reported that the torch &quot;will be constructed by French craftsmen, just as the original was... Ten craftsmen from Les Metalliers Champenois, based in Rheims, will work on the torch in a workshop at the statue&apos;s base on Liberty Island in New York Harbor.&quot; The workshop was made open to the public.  </p>

<p>Other improvements made during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141621/http://statueofliberty.net/historical-facts/restoration/">multimillion dollar project</a>: 1,600 wrought iron bands that hold the statue&#x2019;s copper skin to its frame were also replaced, and an elevator was installed.</p>
