</div></div>					<p>Typically around this time of year, we&apos;d be enjoying a weekly roll-out of new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001314/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> episodes, but the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001314/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/18/mad_men_finale_om.php">ended its run last May</a> with a Coke and a smile, and TV time hasn&apos;t been the same ever since. Throughout its 7.5 seasons, the show accumulated a ton of props&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001314/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/10/pink_bakery_boxes.php"><em>mostly</em> historically accurate</a>&#x2014;and some of those will now be available for purchase. The latest batch hitting the auction block is smaller than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001314/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/31/mad_men_auction.php">last year&apos;s</a>, but includes that filing box that Peggy carries into the McCann Erickson offices like a real badass: </p>

<p>(Strut, smirk, and overall perfect attitude not included.)</p>

<p>You&apos;ll also find Don Draper&apos;s 1964 Chrysler Imperial, Peggy&apos;s typewriter, the sheets that were on the bed when Don had a threesome, Sally&apos;s Kodak Instamatic Camera, Joan&apos;s ice bucket, Trudy&apos;s A&amp;P; bag filled with groceries, Stan&apos;s notepad, and more. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001314/http://madmen-auction.screenbid.com/view-auctions/catalog/id/60/">View all of the items here</a> before bidding begins on June 1st.</p>
