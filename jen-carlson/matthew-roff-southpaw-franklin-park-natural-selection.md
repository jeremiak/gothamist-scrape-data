Not satisfied with that, he <em>also</em> went in as co-owner of the (soon to be) old Galapagos space -- where he&apos;ll be opening a new venue called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160812021031/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/galapagos_moves.php">Natural Selection</a>. He recently told us a little about what to expect from the latter space, as it reopens under his control.</em> </p>

<p><strong>How did the decision to take over the Galapagos space come about?</strong> Well everyone heard that the space was available and that this deal or that deal were going to take place, but they never did. Months and months went by and I forgot all about it. Then a friend of mine told me it was up again  and told me some details which got my attention.  I emailed the owner and set up a meeting that week. After discussing the details with my partners we all decided to go after it and try to make something pop.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us in more detail about any of the &quot;dramatic changes&quot; you have planned.</strong> Just that the back room will be worked on extensively and that artists will want to play in there more frequently. the changes in the main space will be noticeable but happen at a slower rate so it may not be too dramatic.</p>

<p><strong>Will the pool remain?</strong> For now.</p>

<p><strong>When will the doors open?</strong> We currently are taking some steps to start taking over but there is a little red tape in the way still. We are aiming for as smooth a transition as possible without shutting down. We would love to have a party at some point but will need to be smart about the execution of it.</p>
