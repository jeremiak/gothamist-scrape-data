<p>We can now report that Forest Hills Stadium is the most perfect venue in NYC, based on our personal preferences. The intimate feeling, open-air space is in the middle of a tennis complex <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161212151546/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/06/forest_hills_stadium_history.php#photo-1">that has been a part of the Queens neighborhood for<em>ever</em></a>. It&apos;s all very picturesque, with a Tudor-style clubhouse matching the architecture you&apos;ll find around Forest Hills. As a venue it has seen some of the most legendary musicians when they were in their prime: The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand... and last year they came back into the game in a big way, with some fantastic booking for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161212151546/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/16/forest_hills_stadium_announces_summ.php">summer series of shows</a>, including Paul Simon and Dolly Parton. AND NOW they&apos;ve made their first announcement for 2017: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161212151546/http://gothamist.com/tags/tompetty">Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers</a>! </p>

<p>The band is embarking on a 40th anniversary tour next year, and will drop by Forest Hills Stadium on July 26 and 27. &quot;Joe Walsh will appear as a very special guest on many of the dates announced today,&quot; according to their press release.<br>
 <br>
