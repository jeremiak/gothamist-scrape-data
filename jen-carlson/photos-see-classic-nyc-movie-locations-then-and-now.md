<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619012910/http://appstore.com/scenepast">Scenepast iPhone app</a> will transport you back momentarily with a program that allows users to search for a city and year, see a photo from favorite old movie scene shot in the area, and then compare it to how the spot looks today. The app works for both movies and television shows... but hopefully similar ones will come out to focus on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619012910/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycalbumart">album art</a>, and just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619012910/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">Older Times</a>.</p>

<p>Click through to check out some classic locations from New York films, and here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619012910/http://laist.com/2013/11/21/from_pretty_in_pink_to_scarface_the.php">some LA ones</a>.</p>
