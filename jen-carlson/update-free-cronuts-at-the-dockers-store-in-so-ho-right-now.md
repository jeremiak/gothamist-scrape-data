<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> Remember when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045131/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronuts">Cronuts</a> could only be obtained by those with the purest of hearts and the mettle to rise before dawn and stand on line for hours at end? Those innocent days are behind us, and the corporate Fat Cats are now using the pastry to entice potential customers. Sure, maybe you didn&apos;t want to buy khakis <em>yesterday</em>, but it&apos;s a whole new day out there&#x2014;Docker&apos;s currently (as of 3:30 p.m.) has a crazy supply of Cronuts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045131/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/nyregion/how-a-pop-up-store-pops-up.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">in their pop-up store</a> at 25 Howard Street in SoHo.</p>

<p>Is anyone still reading this? </p>

<p>Our source tells us his friend, who took this photo just moments ago, has stolen at least 8 of the Cronuts, &quot;mostly out of the ability to do so.&quot; But are these trademarked Cronuts from Dominique Ansel? Yep. A rep at the bakery tells us they put in their large order on August 1st, at 12:00 a.m. sharp, when they started accepting large pre-orders. So go, go now! &quot;They are absolutely real and free,&quot; our tipster tells us.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve got a man on the way to the scene, and will update this post with information we receive from the field (you know: supply status, trampling, the current price of khakis, etc).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> You guys... sit down. Our man on the street tells us (at 3:55 p.m.), &quot;On my way in the door the first employee that saw me said &apos;no more Cronuts.&quot; So head down the street and get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045131/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/ansel_magic_souffle_cronut.php#photo-11">a Frozen S&apos;more</a> at Dominique Ansel instead.</p>
