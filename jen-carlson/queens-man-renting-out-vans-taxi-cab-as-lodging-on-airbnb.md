title: Queens Man Renting Out Vans, Taxi Cab As Lodging On Airbnb
---

	
										<p>There isn&apos;t a lot of affordable waterfront property in New York City, but one man is making dreams come true <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113021725/http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2015/07/this-is-what-airbnb-allows-regular-new.html">in Queens</a>, having put 3 of his vehicles on Airbnb with a starting price of $22. There&apos;s even a van down by the river, for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113021725/http://www.hulu.com/watch/4183">Matt Foley</a> inside of us all.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113021725/https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7035403">For $69+</a> you can rent this authentic NYC taxi cab, but &quot;don&apos;t worry the Meter is not on,&quot; your host Jonathan jokes in the listing. The renovated cab comes with a full size bed, pillows, and blankets, along with a view of the Manhattan skyline.</p>

<p>This &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113021725/https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6492663?s=h4yk">beautiful conversion sleeper van</a>&quot; starts at $99/night, and has been dressed up with air plants and other colorful things you&apos;d find in a millennial&apos;s apartment. </p>

<p>Finally, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113021725/https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5104476">the Van with a View</a> option, which costs just $22. Though it&apos;s unclear if that&apos;s per hour, as this van is All Bed, baby.</p>

<p>Currently there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113021725/https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3955733#reviews">53 reviews</a> in total for these listings, and they are mostly positive... even from those pointing out there was no bathroom, no shower, no water, and that you are, in fact, sleeping in a hot van. Only in New York? Nah, they pull this in California too, but over there they&apos;ve got these fancy vintage silver vans surrounded by lush greenery, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113021725/https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/733260">see</a>? Fine, you win this round, LA.
