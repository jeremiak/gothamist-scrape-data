<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808174934/http://www.nylofthostel.com/">New York Loft Hostel</a> is open for business and invites you and yours to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808174934/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=6011">&quot;live like a hipster king&quot;</a>! The 1912 &quot;original loft type building&quot; offers up a pool, jacuzzi, 2000-sq-ft garden, bunk beds galore and wifi. But what&apos;s a hipster king without a hipster queen? The building is separated into male and female quarters; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808174934/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/07/22/live_like_a_hipster_king_bunk_beds_included.php?o=0">Curbed</a> notes that &quot;there&apos;s a 14-bed female dorm, 20-bed male dorm and a 22-bed mixed dorm.&quot; The loft is located at 249 Varet Street, and it&apos;ll cost you around $20-something per night -- upon a quick reservation booking test, to stay for all of August it would cost $838.57. That&apos;s some cheap rent right there!</p>
