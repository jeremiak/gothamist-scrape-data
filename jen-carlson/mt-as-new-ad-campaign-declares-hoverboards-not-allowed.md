<p>The MTA has plastered subway cars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006142301/https://twitter.com/daleweisinger/status/702890558281351168">and the insides of buses</a> with their latest ad campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006142301/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/hoverboards_go_home.php">aimed at hoverboards</a>. It&apos;s legal to own a hoverboard in New York, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006142301/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/mcfly_and_get_fined.php">illegal to operate</a> the personal transportation device in NYC. And now you won&apos;t be able to operate or even <em>carry</em> one on any of the city&apos;s trains or busses. This is a safety issue, since they&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006142301/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/hoverboard_peril.php">literally blowing up</a> all over the place.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The safety of our customers and employees is always our top concern,&#x201D; MTA Chief Safety Officer David Mayer said. &#x201C;For obvious reasons, it is not safe to use hoverboards, skateboards or other personal wheeled vehicles on station platforms. We&#x2019;re equally concerned about the safety risk of bringing devices that pose fire hazards into the confined spaces inside trains and buses.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The campaign reads: &quot;You cannot bring one into the subway, onto a bus nor into rail cars or stations. No carrying, no standing, no riding &#x2014; no exceptions. Hoverboards may be the latest fad, but they are not safe because they have the potential to catch fire.&quot;</p>

<p>The prohibition will be enforced by the MTA Police Department (on Metro-North, LIRR, and SI Railway), and the NYPD on subways and buses. But so far they haven&apos;t been able to capture <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006142301/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/video_hoverboard.php">this elusive Bonnie &amp; Clyde duo</a>.</p>
