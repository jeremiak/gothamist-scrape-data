<p>What if we all just all hide indoors for a few hours and let skilled professionals take care of this snow situation with some flame throwers? Back in the day, this is how it was done on Governors Island&#x2014;at least, back on <em>one</em> day. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073922/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19480101&amp;id=UUohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aYEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=359,50943">the Schenectady Gazette</a> (January 1st, 1948, following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508073922/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/flashback_snowfall_in_new_york_1947.php#photo-1">the late December snow of 1947</a>) comes this photo, with the caption: &quot;A new wrinkle in the snow fighting is demonstrated by Sgt. Robert G. Evraets as he throws a roaring stream of flame at snow banks on Governors Island, with an army flame thrower. The fire makes short work of cleaning the area of snow.&quot; They add, however, that in the more populated areas of the city &quot;a shovel is the more prescribed form of equipment.&quot; Which is boring and less efficient. We need to go full Michael Bay on this winter weather!</p>
