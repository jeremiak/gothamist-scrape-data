<p>If you haven&apos;t already discarded your tree or ceremoniously set it on fire or whatever, you might want to consider hauling it over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831084321/http://gothamist.com/tags/mulchfest">Mulchfest</a> this weekend, where its death can finally have some <em>real</em> meaning. This Saturday and Sunday you can drop off your tree at one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831084321/http://nycgovparks.org/services/mulchfest/mulchfest.html">these locations</a>, where it will be recycled into mulch that will be used to nourish trees you <em>didn&apos;t</em> murder this holiday season. You&apos;re also invited to take home your own bag of mulch to use in your backyard or for one of your neighborhood&apos;s street trees.</p>

<p>Last year, nearly 24,000 Christmas trees citywide were recycled, and the Parks Department is looking to break that record. Just remember, if you take part, get all of those ornaments and lights off the tree first&#x2014;the chipper doesn&apos;t take kindly to adornments.</p>
