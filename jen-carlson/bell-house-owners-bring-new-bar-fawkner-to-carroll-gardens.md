<p>&quot;Falconry meets exceptional bar food,&quot; may be the most cringeworthy way to open a press release, but here we are. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809235504/http://www.FawknerNY.com/">Fawkner</a> is a new bar in Carroll Gardens that comes to you from the team behind The Bell House, Union Hall, and Floyd. &quot;The name Fawkner is from an old term used to describe Falconry,&quot; the announcement declares. Okay.</p>

<p>The space will be 2300-square-feet, and house a bar, a fireplace, &quot;cozy nooks,&quot; and a small backyard. You can also expect tons of booze (regional craft beer, whiskey, cocktails and wine), and a little bit of bar food, provided by consulting chef Adam Shepard of Lunetta on Smith Street. The menu includes a fried chicken sandwich with corn pudding &amp; onion strings, boudin blanc with bacon and apple-beet slaw, steak and eggs, and frites with house mayo. </p>

<p>As for the atmosphere (something these guys excel at) it will be very Wes Anderson&apos;s Brooklyn. Which means: </p>

<blockquote>The interior design of Fawkner incorporates a variety of themes, drawing inspiration from many sources including various wings of The American Museum of Natural History as well as 1940&#x2019;s era travel advertisements to the popular National Parks. The space was designed by co-owners Jim Carden and Kevin Avanzato. &#x201C;We wanted to create a space that had a variety of seating areas&#x2014;each with a unique feel and vantage point.  It&#x2019;s a perfect place to come and have a great meal or just meet up with friends for drinks and not have those two worlds at odds&quot; said co-owner Jim Carden.</blockquote>

<p>Fawkner is located at 191 Smith Street, and opens on Saturday, September 19th at noon. Regular hours will be from 12 p.m. to 4 a.m. on weekends, 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. during the week.</p>
