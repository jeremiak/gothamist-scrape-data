<p>When Apple&apos;s iOS 6 launched last week there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104711/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/20/apples_new_maps_have_a_long_way_to.php#photo-1">immediate complaints</a> about the new Apple Maps. It put Coney Island next to Prospect Park, Prospect Park in New Jersey, <em>and so on</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104711/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/28/apple_publicly_apologizes_for_map_a.php">Apple apologized</a>, but that didn&apos;t stop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104711/http://www.madmagazine.com/blog/2012/10/01/apple-maps-wreak-havoc-with-new-yorker-cover">Mad magazine</a> from having a little fun.
