										<p>Madonna, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103752/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/31/madonna_thinks.php">recently stated</a> that NYC gives her the zzz&apos;s, was stirring things up in town for an intimate performance last night. Her Madgesty took the Roseland Ballroom stage in front of 2,200 fans, for a show which demanded die-hards wait in line for what turned out to be 60 hours, just for a <em>chance</em> to get into. Fanatics? <em>No.</em> One of them, a Brooklynite, swears, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not fanatical. But I do collect Madonna magazine covers, and I&#x2019;ve got maybe 170 of them.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Still, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103752/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/arts/01arts-FREEMADONNAS_BRF.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">only 750 fans</a> were rewarded the coveted wristband which gained them free entry; 1,000 were given to radio contest winners, and 200 to members of Madonna&#x2019;s fan club. Presumably, the remaining 250 went to industry and personal friends of the singer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408103752/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/arts/music/01cnd-madonna.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">The NY Times</a> reports on what went down indoors:</p><blockquote>Halfway through her 32-minute set on Wednesday night at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, Madonna offered a message of sympathy.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;All you people I saw sleeping in the street last night,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;this song is for you. Anybody who knows me knows how much I hate to wait.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The room roared with &#x201C;Omigods&#x201D; and lit up with digital camera flashes when Madonna emerged at 10:09 p.m. from behind a revolving stage barrier, dressed in shiny black and wearing lace-up boots.</p></blockquote>Perhaps the greatest stage decor she had last night was Justin Timberlake, who joined her on one song and was promptly cornered by the Material <strike>Girl</strike> Cougar. All this was in celebration of &quot;Hard Candy,&quot; her latest album, and her last on longtime label Warner Brothers; it came out this Tuesday.<p></p>
