<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301030610/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">The High Line</a> is taking advantage of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301030610/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/26/snowiest_january_ever.php">this snowy month</a>, and tell us they&apos;ll be hosting their first ever Snow Sculpt-Off tomorrow. Think you&apos;ve got what it takes? Registration begins at 2 p.m. (at the lower level of the Chelsea Market Passage) and judges will vote around 4 p.m.&#x2014;yes, there will be prizes. They include an iPod shuffle, merchandise from local stores, and the golden ticket: a behind-the-scenes tours of the High Line. You are encouraged to bring your own tools and any extra adornments you may need.
