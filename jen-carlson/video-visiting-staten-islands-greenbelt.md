title: Video: Visiting Staten Island's Greenbelt

										<p>Say what you will about Staten Island, but the borough contains the most secluded of natural landscapes in the city: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110122126/http://www.sigreenbelt.org/">the Greenbelt</a>. The space is 2,800 acres, and is run by the Greenbelt Conservancy and the NYC Parks Department, who have an operating agreement. Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110122126/http://thirteen.org/">Thirteen.org</a> documented the area for their City Concealed video, which they&apos;re releasing later today. We&apos;ve got it a little early for you, and you can watch it below. </p>

<p>A fun little bit of history you&apos;ll hear about: one man recalls the construction of the Richmond Parkway&#x2014;the brainchild of Robert Moses, of course&#x2014;and as they were digging out footings and blasting away rock, a new formation was created. It was eventually called Moses Mountain. The highway has never been built, but it&apos;s still on the state maps&#x2014;and as an unplanned outcome, Robert Moses actually left locals with a nice view!</p>
