<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/31/bloomberg_announces_soda_ban_today.php">we noted</a> the irony in Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s war on supersized sweetened drinks and his simultaneous celebratory proclamation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/03/mmmm_national_donut_day.php">Doughnut Day</a>, to be read in Madison Square Park today alongside the largest box of Entenmann&apos;s Donuts ever created. La la la let&apos;s ignore the mixed messages and get on board with this doughy debauchery. In celebration of National Donut Day, both Dunkin&apos; Donuts <em>and</em> Krispy Kreme are giving out free treats. At the latter, there is no purchase necessary (and they&apos;re also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/https://twitter.com/KKDCruiser/status/207928834908106752">hitting the streets today</a>); at the former you&apos;ll have to buy a beverage. But if you&apos;re going to ingest all those sugary calories, loosen up the pursestrings and get yourself something a little more homemade.</p>

<p>Our love of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/a_food_drink_tour_of_greenpoint.php#photo-9">Peter Pan</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://gothamist.com/tags/doughnutplant">Doughnut Plant</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/07/bed-stuy_food_tour.php#photo-10">Dough</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/dun-well_doughnuts_opens_today.php">Dun-well</a> has been well-documented&#x2014;they&apos;re all worthy places to stop by today (Dun-well is even offering a free coffee if you purchase a half dozen). Elsewhere, you can pick up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://media.gothamistllc.com/newsletters/gothamist/2012/04/25.php">Cr&#xE8;me Br&#xFB;l&#xE9;e doughnut</a> (or other vegan option) at the Cinnamon Snail truck, and for hard-core carnivores there&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120601155858/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/09/a_faux_vs_foie_gras_doughnut_taste-.php#photo-7">Fois Gras Doughnut</a> at Do Or Dine&#x2014;but who else is serving up unique versions of the sweet treat?</p>
