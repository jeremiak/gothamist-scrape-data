Surprising, strange and wonderful at the same time, it made you feel like the insider on something special.&quot; With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002827/http://loho10002.blogspot.com/2006/12/ford-fitzroy-at-sin-eford-fitzroy-at.html">a review like that</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002827/http://www.fordandfitzroy.com/audio">two tracks</a> floating around that we can&apos;t stop listening to, we couldn&apos;t be more psyched to see this band at our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002827/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/movable_hype/">Movable Hype</a> show this Thursday. Join us, and be one of the first in on the secret. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
<strong>Glenn Waldman:</strong>  From the Van Morrison  song - Madame George</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
<strong>Jay Schneider:</strong> Waking up the first morning in our new apartment and finding nate (our rhythm guitarist) brushing his teeth with glenn&apos;s toothbrush</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out?</strong><br>
<strong>GW:</strong> it used to be international bar, but that has closed.  right now the best place to flask it through the post-industrial wasteland in bay ridge. probably on sunday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>JS:</strong> the hanger on 3rd street because my girlfriend owns it</p>
