His company&apos;s motto was: &quot;The hitherto impossible in photography is our specialty.&quot; (Check out some of his other camera contraptions at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531040351/http://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2013/06/25/aerial-photography-pioneer-george-r.-lawrence-made-the-impossible-possible">Imaging Resource</a>.)<p></p>

<p>Photographer George R. Lawrence shot American cities and towns from thousands of feet above ground, giving many people their first look at their homes from above. And he did the impossible by remotely shooting an electrical current up to the camera.</p>

<p>The contraption was called the Lawrence Captive Airship, or Kite Train&#x2014;and you can learn more about it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531040351/http://robroy.dyndns.info/lawrence/kitelines94.html">here</a>. </p>
