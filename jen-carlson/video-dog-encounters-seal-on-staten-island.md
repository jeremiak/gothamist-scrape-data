title: Video: Dog Encounters Seal On Staten Island
---

	
										<p>&quot;Dog meets seal&quot; sure sounds cute, but we&apos;re a bit concerned about this little guy in the video. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714145636/http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2010/03/video_dog_meets_seal_at_great.html">SILive</a> reports that Julio, the chocolate Lab, and his owner Andrew Maira encountered this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714145636/http://gothamist.com/tags/seal">seal</a> in the sand of Great Kills Park on Staten Island. As Maira says in the video, &quot;that&apos;s a sick seal.&quot; We&apos;re attempting to find out if he called anyone to report the sighting.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time a seal has been spotted on the Island; this guy was seen basking in the sun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714145636/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/27/this_seal_may_be_shedding_staten_is.php">back in January</a>... and there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714145636/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/03/video_of_the_da_60.php">plenty of others</a>.</p>
