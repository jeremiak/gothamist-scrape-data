<p>The big news about the New York Comedy Festival is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128161307/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/arts/tracy-morgan-to-return-to-the-new-york-comedy-festival.html">Tracy Morgan&apos;s return</a> to the November fest, which is entering its 13th year (and hasn&apos;t seen Morgan for five of those years). The lineup also promises headlining sets from Dane Cook, Marc Maron, Trevor Noah, Patton Oswalt, Bill Maher, Chris D&apos;elia, Eric Andre, T.J. Miller, &quot;and many more.&quot; Where are the women? Among the initial lineup announcement there are three: Tig Notaro, Bridget Everett, and Cameron Esposito.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128161307/http://www.nycomedyfestival.com/">The festival</a> will feature more than 200 comedians, and we&apos;re told it&apos;s currently unclear how many of those will be women. The organizers declined to comment on the gender imbalance thus far, but this is something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128161307/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/beverly-wettenstein/no-women-featured-in-ny-c_b_316770.html">they&apos;ve been criticized</a> for in the past.</p>

<p>Caroline Hirsch, founder and owner of the New York Comedy Festival and Carolines on Broadway, released a general statement regarding the fest, which she says &quot;continues to present the performers at the forefront of comedy.&quot; It&apos;s possible that many of the other women not listed in their big announcement who are definitely in the forefront of comedy were unavailable during the festival, or just haven&apos;t been announced yet. It&apos;s also possible comedy is still a boy&apos;s club despite it being 2016.</p>

<p>The six-day festival will take over a number of NYC venues, including Carnegie Hall, where Tracy Morgan will perform&#x2014;he released this statement: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m very excited about returning to the New York Comedy Festival this year... I can&#x2019;t wait to get on stage at the legendary Carnegie Hall to perform in front of my family, my friends and my home town fans.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The presale will run from August 10th to 14th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128161307/http://www.citiprivatepass.com/">here</a>; tickets for all shows are available to the general public starting August 15th at 10 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128161307/http://www.nycomedyfestival.com/">here</a>.</p>
