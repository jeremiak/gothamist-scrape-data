<p>The bohemians came to Greenwich Village way before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527213703/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/video_spend_a_sunday_in_greenwich_v.php">the mid-20th century</a> (by the early 1960s that area was already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527213703/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70F1EF73A58137A93C4AB1783D85F468685F9">going bourgeois</a>)&#x2014;the first tea house in the area was The Mad Hatter, a meeting hub for intellectuals and artists that opened in the early 1900s at 150 West 4th Street. This is now home to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527213703/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=150+W.+4th+St.+ny&amp;ll=40.731495,-74.000559&amp;spn=0.005894,0.013261&amp;sll=40.731375,-74.000706&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,189.94,,0,0.24&amp;cbll=40.731549,-74.000667&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=150+W+4th+St,+New+York,+10014&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=0188avxAEF8Ijk9rO3dyog">a diner</a>, and right next door you&apos;ll notice the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527213703/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/M125C/highlights/10766">Golden Swan Garden</a>, an unexpected homage to &quot;one of Greenwich Village&apos;s seediest but most influential hangouts&quot; of the early 1900s&#x2014;also known as the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527213703/http://theboweryboys.blogspot.com/2009/02/golden-swan-hell-hole-for-village.html">Hell Hole</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527213703/http://new-york-city.yodelout.com/greenwich-village/">YodelOut</a>, many inexpensive meals were taken in at &quot;these little tearooms... and helped make famous the Mad Hatter, first of the many on West Fourth Street.&quot; There, &quot;Willem Hendrik Van Loon&#x2019;s impromptu sketches on the menus became treasured items.&quot; We&apos;ve contacted the NYPL to see if they have any of these in their menu archives, and will update if we get our hands on anything.</p>
