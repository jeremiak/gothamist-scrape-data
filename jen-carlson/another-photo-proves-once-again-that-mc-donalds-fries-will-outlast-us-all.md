<p>When fast food refuses to age, we just can&apos;t look away. It&apos;s horrifying! Yet here we are again gazing upon it like we&apos;re standing in front of the Mona Lisa. This masterpiece was found on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220119/http://www.reddit.com/user/atopiary">Reddit</a>, and shows one jar containing KFC fries and the other containing McDonald&apos;s fries, both sealed off in 2008. Here we are just over three years later and the McDonald&apos;s fries don&apos;t look like they&apos;ve aged one day.</p>

<p>Sure, this has all been done before (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220119/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htnvzLU1I1o">check out this video</a> of aging McProducts from 2007), but fries not getting old <em>never gets old</em> (nor does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220119/http://www.good.is/post/mcdonald-s-hamburgers-don-t-age/">hamburgers never getting old</a>). But maybe to spice things up, next time someone can <em>taste</em> the three-year-old fries? We need to go next level with this experiment, people.
