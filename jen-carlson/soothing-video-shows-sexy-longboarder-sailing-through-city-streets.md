<p>Meet Priscilla, who skates for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085050/http://www.unclefunkysboards.com/">Uncle Funky&apos;s Board Shop</a> in Manhattan. She started skating the city as a teenager, and got into longboarding at 19-years-old&#x2014;the below video, set to the soothing Max Sedgley song &quot;Slowly,&quot; shows her showing off her skills, at times with a troupe of other skaters. It will likely abate your fear of riding through the city on a simple board, and make you want to give a shot yourself. Also, it almost seems like it comes to us from another time and place? Enjoy:</p>
