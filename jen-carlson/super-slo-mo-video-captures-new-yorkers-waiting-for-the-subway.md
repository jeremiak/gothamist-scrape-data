<p>While on a passing subway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015109/http://www.magyaradam.com/">Adam Magyar</a> captured New Yorkers standing on the the platform at Grand Central station with a slow motion camera. The result is beautiful, even if there&apos;s something a little bit sad about it. Magyar describes his subjects as &quot;an endless row of living sculptures brought together by the same subway line, the same direction, the same intention of taking the train to get caught and carried away by the urban flow. All their motions slowed down, they are graceful...&quot;  We&apos;re all in this together, guys, even if we&apos;re in our own little worlds...</p>

<p>And as a young Ferris Bueller once said: &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&apos;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015109/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1usz7g/super_slow_motion_video_of_42nd_st_station_from/">Reddit</a>]</p>
