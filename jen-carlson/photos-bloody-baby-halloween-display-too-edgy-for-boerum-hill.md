</div></div>					<p>Halloween is coming, and one Brooklyn resident has created a terrifying tableau that will with 100% certainty give children, puppies, and adults who walk by it nightmares for days. For this is not just a Halloween display, it&apos;s a look inside the mind of someone who lives amongst us. <em>Bwahahahaha.</em></p>

<p>A reader tipped us off to the scene this morning&#x2014;which you&apos;ll find at Bergen Street between Bond and Nevins&#x2014;and tells us a mother was <em>literally seen shielding her children&apos;s eyes</em> from the display, which is made from doll parts, fake (?) baby blood, and innocent childrens&apos; nightmares. South Brooklyn hasn&apos;t seen something so controversial since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224052630/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/16/cobble_hill_residents_cant_stop_tal.php">that exposed shower</a>.  </p>

<p>Our own Josh Steele dropped by this morning and says a woman walking by declared: &quot;Wow. That&apos;s fucked up. They must not have kids. This really reflects poorly on Brooklyn and this neighborhood.&quot; You use that kind of language in front of children, lady? Anyway, it&apos;s difficult to choose a side here&#x2014;has the display creator gone too far, or is the neighborhood reaction predictably a little over the top?</p>

<p>Let&apos;s take a closer look and stare The Fear head on: we&apos;ve got lots of dolls here, each being tortured in a different fashion. Many are in jars, some are being hung from tree branches, at least one is impaled with what looks like barbecue kebabs, another is chained to a chair with duct taper over its mouth, a few have been stripped of their torsos and given pumpkin bodies, one has a bloody baby spurting out of its stomach, and perhaps the most terrifying piece is Dr. Pumpkin over there, operating on a bloody disemboweled doll. Hey, <em>doesn&apos;t he bear a striking resemblance to your child&apos;s pediatrician?</em></p>

<p>And just in case none of those things give you an uneasy feeling, the creator even tossed in a clown. Which looks dead. So there&apos;s probably also a clown&apos;s ghost amongst this murder scene, unless it&apos;s already floating over to <em>your</em> place...</p>
