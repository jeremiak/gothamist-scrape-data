<p>Yesterday when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521032152/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_one_of_these_men_is_banksy.php#photo-1">Banksy&apos;s Red Hook warehouse was discovered</a>, we went to investigate. While the lot was being watched by guards, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521032152/http://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a> managed to get in, telling us this car under a tarp was &quot;the only remotely suspicious looking thing&quot; there. Nic Garcia went back around sundown and saw the car, noting someone had gone through the trouble to really secure a tarp on there <em>good</em>. He also had some theories about the shape... look familiar?:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521032152/https://twitter.com/marc_yearsley">Marc Yearsley</a> returned to the scene for us this morning, and the car is still there, and it&apos;s likely Banksy is still in the process of relocating to a new secret location. So IT ALL ADDS UP. Will we be seeing this car before the end of the month? Or maybe it&apos;s just some random car... in a guarded lot in Red Hook... securely hidden by a tarp. We&apos;re okay with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521032152/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_one_of_these_men_is_banksy.php">wild speculation</a>, it&apos;s part of the fun.</p>

<p>So far the only piece with a car in it was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521032152/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/new_dramatic_banksy_piece_goes_up_o.php">WikiLeaks themed piece</a> in the empty lot on the Lower East Side (that car was later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521032152/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php">towed out of there</a> to safety, after the doors had been ripped off).</p>
