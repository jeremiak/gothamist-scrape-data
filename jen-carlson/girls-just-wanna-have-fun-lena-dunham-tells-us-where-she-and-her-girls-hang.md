<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="dunhamgirls0513.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/dunhamgirls0513.jpeg" width="300" height="267" class="image-right"> </span>The Lena Dunham-created, Judd Apatow-produced, highly anticipated HBO show <em>Girls</em> will premiere this coming Sunday, April 15th. We&apos;ve seen the first three episodes, and can tell you it lives up to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/five_reasons_were_excited_for_lena.php">the intense amount of hype</a> it&apos;s already been getting for months. </p>

<p>In the show, Dunham&apos;s character Hannah refers to certain parts of Brooklyn as &quot;Grown-Up Brooklyn,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/lena_dunham_interview_1.php">told us last week</a>, &quot;I&apos;m a grown-up Brooklyn resident, I made fun of it but I like it.&quot; (Dunham and co-star Jemima Kirke both attended St. Ann&apos;s school in Brooklyn Heights.) She also offered up some of her favorite places to grab a grown-up drink, inside and outside of the borough, and we&apos;ve coupled her suggestions with some of the spots the characters go to on the show, creating you a GIRLS Guide to NYC.</p>

<p>Of course, in the spirit of individuality, you could, and should, always make your own decisions, girl. But who can pass up a turkey leg dipped in milk?</p>

<ul><li>&quot;My favorite... I&apos;ve always been a <strong>Corner Bistro</strong> lover, the hamburgers there, and I shouldn&apos;t say this but it was a good place to use your fake ID in high school.&quot;
</li><li>&quot; I really love <strong>Nancy Whiskey</strong> in TriBeca. I&apos;m so embarrassed in bars trying to order a drink, so any place they make it easy for me is great.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;I love <strong>Henry Public</strong> in Cobble Hill. They have the best turkey leg sandwich, with the turkey soaked in milk before they put it on the bread, it&apos;s unbelievable.&quot;
</li><li>&quot;And I also love, if you&apos;re feeling fancy, to go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300/http://www.barcentralenyc.com/youfoundus.html"><strong>Bar Centrale</strong></a>. Not that I&apos;m feeling fancy that often.&quot;
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300/http://www.yelp.com/biz/tom-and-jerrys-new-york"><strong>Tom &amp; Jerry&apos;s</strong></a> in NoHO is shown in one of the early episodes when Jessa is seen there alone, drinking a White Russian. 
</li><li>Dunham&apos;s character Hannah refers to a couple of bars she likes in &quot;Grown-Up Brooklyn&quot; during the first episode. She thinks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300/http://www.yelp.com/biz/weather-up-brooklyn"><strong>Weather Up</strong></a> is a little too fancy, with their mixologists and all, but likes places like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300/http://www.yelp.com/biz/washington-commons-brooklyn"><strong>Washington Commons</strong></a>, which are more on the dive-bar side, at least aesthetically.
</li><li>BYO-Flask, because obviously it&apos;s not a bar, but <strong>the High Line</strong> is shown in the show, when one character makes an after-hours trip there. Dunham also mentions it in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150309054300/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/lena_dunham_interview_1.php">our interview</a>, calling it &quot;a symbol of new New York and waspy sexiness.&quot;</li></ul>
