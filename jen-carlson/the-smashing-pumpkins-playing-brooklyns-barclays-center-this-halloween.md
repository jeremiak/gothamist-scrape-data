<p>The Smashing Pumpkins&#x2014;with their 2012 lineup of Billy Corgan, Jeff Schroeder, Mike Byrne and Nicole Fiorentino&#x2014;are the latest band to announce a show at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. For their first set they&apos;ll be performing their new album, <em>Oceania</em>, in full, followed by a set of classics and deep cuts. </p>

<p>In classic Corgan-speak, the musician <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083350/http://www.antiquiet.com/interviews/2012/06/billy-corgan-interview-oceania/">recently said</a>, &quot;When people come to see the tour, we&#x2019;re going to play <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083350/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/oceania/"><em>Oceania</em></a>, sixty minutes, as it was written. Front to back. We&#x2019;ll have to make that work in front of that audience... The fact of the matter is that I&#x2019;ve written more hit songs than just about anybody in my generation. So if I feel like playing &#x2018;em, I&#x2019;ll fucking play &#x2018;em. My mentality has always been, &#x2018;okay, you want it? We&#x2019;re going to shove it down your throat.&#x2019;&quot; Prepare thyself, Pumpkins fan.</p>

<p>The new album has gotten great reviews since its release in June, with many calling it the best thing Corgan has put out since the 90s.</p>

As for the old hits, we&apos;re rooting for &quot;Soma&quot;: </p>
