<p>Jimmy Fallon is two weeks into his <em>Tonight Show</em> gig, and if you want to attend a taping he&apos;s just announced that tickets for April are now up for grabs. As of right now there are still dates left with tickets available. </p>

<p>There are plenty of rules <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075139/http://www.showclix.com/event/thetonightshowstarringjimmyfallon">in the reservations section</a>&#x2014;where they note that &quot;all tickets are complimentary&quot;&#x2014;including a dress code for audience members (&quot;Smart Casual&quot;). </p>

<p>This is a chance to see the gorgeous new studio, as well as some of the first <em>Tonight Show</em> tapings back in New York, where up until two weeks ago it had not been filmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075139/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/17/the_tonight_show_returns_to_nyc_aft.php">for 42 years</a>.</p>
