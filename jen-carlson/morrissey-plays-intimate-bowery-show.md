</div></div>					<p>Morrissey has been touring his 49-year-old ass off as of late, most recently with a series of smaller shows, perhaps the most intimate being this past Saturday at Bowery Ballroom. There was some notable between-song banter, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213947/http://weblogs.newsday.com/entertainment/music/blog/2009/03/top_10_things_morrissey_said_l_1.html">Newsday</a> has a Top Ten list of Moz quotes from the night, including &quot;I&#x2019;m the type who just can&#x2019;t find love,&quot; and &quot;Who am I? This is a question that many have died trying to answer...I can only be identified on a slab, by the scars of pain.&quot; (Aw, give this guy a hug if you see him around town.) He also made note of the high security at the venue, saying, &quot;We&#x2019;re like a jealously guarded can of sardines.&quot; Wonder if anyone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213947/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/30/smiths_speed_dating.php">found love</a> in the audience.</p>

<p>Later this week he&apos;ll be playing both Webster and Carnegie Hall, and he referenced the neighborhood change in his banter at Bowery, saying, &quot;In a few days, we will be in a posher part of town, so obviously none of you will be there. Nice meeting you.&quot; Don&apos;t take it personally, he probably just didn&apos;t want <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213947/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2009/03/live_morrissey_1.php">to get stoned again</a>.</p>
