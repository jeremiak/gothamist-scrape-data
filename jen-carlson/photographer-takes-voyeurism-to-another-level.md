										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="voyeurism1209.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011019im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/voyeurism1209.jpg" width="640" height="467" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Surprisingly none of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011019/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/13/views.php">views from your windows</a> had people in them, but photographer Yasmine Chatila&apos;s new exhibit is <em>all</em> about voyeuristic views. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011019/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/weirdo_window_watch_kXr7XBMFcvVlz8tAX3TMmN">The NY Post</a>&apos;s Justin Rocket Silverman reports on her saucy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011019/http://www.yasminechatila.com/works_stolen_moments.html">Stolen Moments</a> series, now on sale at the Upper East Side&apos;s Edelman Arts gallery.</p>

<p>Chatila told the paper about some of her subjects, all of which have no idea their moves are being captured on film. She noted that one woman &quot;showered every day in front of a large window, apparently knowing that office workers in the building across the street were watching.&quot; The photographer also declares that if your curtains aren&apos;t drawn during your most private moments... you know full well someone is watching you. <em>You know who you are.</em></p>

<p>There is some amount of Photoshopped privacy added to Chatila&apos;s images however &#x2014; she blurs or shadows to them and changes framing to help disguise her subjects and their locations. When asked of the legal implications, the Brooklyn D.A. wouldn&apos;t comment, saying there were &quot;too many complications.&quot; With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011019/http://www.yasminechatila.com/view.php?group=1&amp;item=2">photo</a> <em>and</em> video of a teenage girl changing, and the same treatment for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520011019/http://www.yasminechatila.com/view.php?group=1&amp;item=9&amp;video=1">two people having sex in a kitchen</a>... complicated might be an understatement.</p>
