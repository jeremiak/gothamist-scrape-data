</div></div>					<p>Perhaps it&apos;s Wagner&apos;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; that really does it for us, but this footage of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016034633/http://gothamist.com/tags/1970s">1970s New York City</a> is arguably the best we&apos;ve ever seen.  </p>

<p>Courtesy of the Thames TV program &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016034633/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here...%3F">Wish You Were Here..?</a>&quot; the 7 minutes will take you all over Manhattan in the year 1974&#x2014;from high above the Empire State Building to a humble lunch counter to Fraunces Tavern and the Federal Building. Everyone&apos;s smoking! Brunch was so basic looking! And is that a car parked right up against The Met? Yes it is. </p>
