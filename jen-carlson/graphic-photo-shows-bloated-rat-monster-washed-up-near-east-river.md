<p>Yesterday we received three graphic photos of this above creature on the shore of the East River. Our tipster wrote, &quot;Is this another incarnation of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/tags/montaukmonster">Montauk Monster</a>, or just the biggest rat in the city?&quot; The animal was under the Brooklyn Bridge on the Manhattan side, and was &quot;maybe two feet, a bit more perhaps, head to tail.&quot;</p>

<p>The first reported &quot;Montauk Monster&quot; was spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/31/montauk_monster.php">in 2008</a>, and since then some more similar animals have washed up in different locations, and with each one new theories are tossed around: a turtle without its shell, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/05/montauk_monster_4.php">a raccoon</a>, a dog, a pig, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/09/montauk_monster_2.php">movie props</a>, lab tested animal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/30/montuak_monster.php">from Plum Island</a>, and so on. </p>

<p>Of course, the government (and annoying rational people) would like the public to believe that each of these washed up &quot;monsters&quot; are just dead bloated animals. But our source in the comments section of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://www.abovetopsecret.com/">AboveTopSecret.com</a> tells us this photo clearly shows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOv5ZjAOpC8">a R.O.U.S.</a> that drowned during the Giant Mutant Urban Rat Army&apos;s special skills <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/28/rat_emerges_from_toilet_to_terrify.php">swimming test</a>. Our future overlords are clearly honing their skills before they follow through with Phase IV of their takeover plan, and we wouldn&apos;t doubt if they were behind the leaked photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/giant_rat.php">giant rats</a> that have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414150047/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/brooklyn_man_stabs_giant_rat_with_p.php">gone viral</a> in recent months.</p>
