According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163625/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/19/2010-10-19_pit_bulls_escape_bronx_home_and_pounce_on_couple_before_cops_tranquilize_dogs.html">the Daily News</a>, the dogs bit the 55-year-old man and 25-year-old woman on the feet and legs as they ran from them around 12:30 a.m. </p>

<p>The owners said they don&apos;t know what happened, but investigators believe the dogs escaped from their back yard; they have not been charged with any wrongdoing. The victims were treated from their bites and released from St. Barnabas Hospital. And as for the dogs, they were tranquilized by the Emergency Service Unit cops, and are now being held at Animal Care and Control in East Harlem&#x2014;it&apos;s not clear what will happen to them next. </p>
