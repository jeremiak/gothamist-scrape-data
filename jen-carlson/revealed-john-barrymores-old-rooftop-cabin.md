<p>The historic house was revealed during some recent NYU construction and is now on full display. The site explains, &quot;the quaint little aerie was the work of actor John Barrymore, a longtime Villager who created this secluded &apos;Alchemist&apos;s Corner&apos; in the air nearly one hundred years ago.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621045756/http://newyorkdailyphoto.blogspot.com/2009/10/alchemists-corner.html">NY Daily Photo</a> has a quote from a more recent resident, saying: &quot;As I settled in, I researched my new home. Barrymore had taken up residence in 1917, just before he began performing his legendary Hamlet uptown. Barrymore had remodeled the apartment as a Gothic retreat, christening it the Alchemist&#x2019;s Corner. He had installed all the false beams, monastery-inspired ironwork, and stained glass, which made his lair resemble a stage set for an Agatha Christie whodunnit in summer stock. The rooftop had been his masterpiece, and had at one time included a garden, with cedar trees, a slate walkway, and a reflecting pool. Of Barrymore&#x2019;s vision only the cottage remained; he&#x2019;d likened it to a roost overlooking the spires of Paris.&quot;</p>
