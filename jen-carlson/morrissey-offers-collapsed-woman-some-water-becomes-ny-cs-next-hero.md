<p>Did Morrissey (nee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213912/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/morrissey_on_the_ramones_in_1976_th.php">Steve</a>) help an old lady in New York City? According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213912/http://www.queerty.com/morrissey-rescues-elderly-woman-who-collapsed-at-nycs-legendary-strand-bookstore-20120926/#ixzz27fuUyE9U">to Queerty</a>, he was at the Strand Bookstore last Sunday &quot;when an elderly lady collapsed to to the ground beside him&quot; in the photography section&#x2014;but Moz didn&apos;t just stand there giving her a lecture on how her fall is probably related to her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213912/http://www.peta2.com/heroes/morrissey/">intake of meat</a>, instead he channeled his charming side.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Morrissey, who was there alone, immediately rushed to her side and crouched on the ground to see if she was okay. She had just lost her bearings and was fine. <strong>He picked up her stray belongings and asked if he could get her some water or call for help.</strong> She declined and collected her things and moved on. But my friend said she touched Morrissey&#x2019;s cheek in gratitude! Obviously, she didn&#x2019;t know who he was, just was touched by this act of kindness from a nice British man... He seemed very shaken up and flustered by the incident and left the store soon afterwards without buying anything.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>No, this doesn&apos;t quite put him up to the ranks of Ryan Gosling&#x2014;who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213912/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/03/ryan_gosling_just_saved_someone_fro.php">saved a woman</a> from getting hit by a cab <em>and</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213912/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/video_ryan_gosling_breaks_up_nyc_st.php">stopped an art caper</a> on the mean streets of Astor Place. However, the story may provide a helpful tip to fans&#x2014;next time you are about to meet Morrissey, just collapse and he probably won&apos;t be a jerk to you.</p>
