For the past four years Deruytter has repetitively photographed the omnipresent billboards watching over New York&apos;s streets and pedestrians like Dr. Eckleburg&apos;s eyes. Documenting  the visual substance of the billboards and our reactions to them, as well as the overabundance of commercial advertising. We&apos;re hoping they aren&apos;t all of those Calvin Klein ads that hover over Houston.</p>

<blockquote>These billboards, in many ways, capture the peculiar forces found in the existence of many New Yorkers, a kind of balanced blend of high art and vibrant commerce. The billboards are massive, often provocative, and seemingly impossible for New Yorkers to ignore. Yet they often do.</blockquote>

<p>We&apos;ve never really seen billboards as &quot;high art&quot;, per se, but this exhibit seems worth checking out. <br>
Wessel + O&apos;Connor is located at 111 Front Street Suite 200 DUMBO, BK // Hours are Wednesday to Saturday 10-6</p>
