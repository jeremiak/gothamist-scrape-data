<span class="photo_caption">How much for the neon sign? (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/https://www.thankuobama.us/chance-for-thanku-obama/">Thank U Obama</a>)</span></p>

<p>As we close out week 2 in our New World Order (or is it week 1,984?), allow me to remind you that people on this planet are still mostly good and kind and not xenophobic trashbags. And again, it&apos;s okay (and important <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/trump_anxiety_therapist.php">for your mental health</a>) to take a break from these disturbing current events and focus, for a little bit, on some positive news. The good stuff hasn&apos;t stopped happening just because the delusional hell-bound bad hombres grabbed the wheel at the White House. Promise!</p>

<p>Here are five good and/or amusing things that we read about this week:</p>

<ul><li>This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/boy-pays-forward-free-toy-stand-front-yard/story?id=45218917">6-year-old kid</a> in Florida created a sidewalk Free Toy stand &quot;to allow less fortunate children to choose anything they wished from his toy pile.&quot; Maybe in the future, &quot;Florida Man&quot; will mean something good.
</li><li>There is now a &quot;Thank You Obama&quot; clothing line, featuring Chance the Rapper as a model. Designer JoeFreshgoods <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/https://www.thankuobama.us/about-the-project/">explained</a>: &#x201C;I decided to make a collection saying &#x2018;thank you&#x2019; and give me something to smile at every now and then when i look in the closet.&#x201D; This would be nicer if some proceeds went to the ACLU or Planned Parenthood or any organization fighting against the current administration, but if you simply want to be reminded that good exists whenever you get dressed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/https://www.thankuobama.us/about-the-project/">you can buy something here</a>.
</li><li>No one is strong enough to resist clicking on this headline: &quot;Video: Man comes to aid squirrel with cereal bowl on its head.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/http://www.omaha.com/news/goodnews/stuck-in-the-middle-with-you-man-comes-to-aid/article_f67f469a-e89b-11e6-bbce-175094219752.html">Only in Omaha</a>!
</li><li>Barry White, Jr. is a 5th grade teacher in North Carolina, and he&apos;s created &quot;elaborate, personalized handshakes&quot; for every single of one of his students. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/https://gma.yahoo.com/teacher-personalized-handshakes-every-one-students-200526323--abc-news-topstories.html">watch them all here</a>.
</li><li>Last month, a temporary video store opened in Los Angeles which only carried <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/http://laist.com/2017/01/18/jerrys_pop_up.php">14,000 VHS copies</a> of the feature film <em>Jerry Maguire</em>. It was odd and delightful, and we sincerely hope that what we see in this below photo (taken in Brooklyn) is the beginning of similar shop featuring at least as many VHS copies of <em>Speed</em>.</li></ul>

<p>If that didn&apos;t help... It&apos;s also okay to daydream. This week, for example, when I saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a52775/barack-obama-hat-backwards-caribbean/">those photos of Barack Obama on that private island</a>, I daydreamed that he was there building us a new America, and that I would be invited.</p>

<p><em>We are publishing one of these every Friday, so if you see something nice happen during the week, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205235252/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">let us know</a>.</em></p>
