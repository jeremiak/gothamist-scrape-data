<p>There used to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160225/http://modernfarmer.com/2014/02/central-parks-sheeps-meadow/">sheep in Central Park</a> and cows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160225/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/flashback_cow_tunnels.php#photo-1">roaming underneath Manhattan</a>, but this kind of bucolic livestock is largely missing from contemporary NYC. Soon, however, Prospect Park (where there were also sheep in the early 1900s) will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160225/https://www.prospectpark.org/learn-more/what-we-do/preserving-environment/green-goats/">introduce goats</a> to their landscape.</p>

<p>The eight goats will be coming in temporarily &quot;to assist with woodland restoration after damage caused by Hurricane Sandy and other recent storms,&quot; according to the Prospect Park Alliance. This is costing about $15,000, and funding is coming from the National Parks Service, administered through the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. They will stay in a protected, fenced-in area throughout their time in the Park.</p>

<p>The Alliance explains that the storms &quot;damaged over 500 trees in the Park, leaving the woodlands vulnerable to invasive plants and weeds.&quot; These include English ivy, goutweed and poison ivy, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160225/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/nyregion/new-york-today-a-hardworking-herd.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">the NY Times</a>, the latter of which they love. Farmer Larry Cihanek told them, &quot;They will eat their favorite foods first, and one of their top foods is poison ivy. They love it.&#x201D; Mmmm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160225/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/spotted_goat_eating_pizza_in_midtow.php">poison ivy pizza</a>.</p>

<p>Once the goats&#x2014;who arrive on May 16th&#x2014;do their job, the Alliance says they will &quot;enhance the woodlands with new native plants and trees.&quot; And while the goats are on the clock, they&apos;re planning some &quot;goats-centric fun,&quot; which you can check out below:</p>
