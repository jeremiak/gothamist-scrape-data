<p>It appears to be summer festival announcement season&#x2014;yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517145539/http://laist.com/2017/01/03/2017_coachella.php">Coachella revealed their lineup,</a> and today we get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517145539/http://gothamist.com/tags/governorsball">New York&apos;s own Governors Ball</a> lineup.The fest will take place on Randall&apos;s Island this June 2nd through 4th, with acts like Tool, Chance the Rapper, Phoenix, Childish Gambino, Lorde, Flume, Wu-Tang Clan, Wiz Khalifa, Beach House, and more (see below for full lineup).</p>

<p>This is the 7th annual Governors Ball festival, which began as a much smaller event on Governors Island and quickly expanded. The fest helped pave the way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517145539/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/festival_fail.php">bring big annual music festivals back</a> to New York. On top of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517145539/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/meadows_festival_photos_video.php#photo-1">the new Meadows Festival</a>, last year Coachella organizers (AEG Live/Goldenvoice) followed suit, and brought their own big East Coast event&#x2014;their inaugural Panorama Fest&#x2014;to Randall&apos;s Island, causing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517145539/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/governors_ball_vs_aeg_live.php">a little bit of (not so) friendly competition</a> in the summer festival world. It&apos;s likely that you&apos;ll see some of this year&apos;s Coachella acts on Panorama&apos;s lineup, as well&#x2014;which means Radiohead may be coming to town.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517145539/https://www.governorsballmusicfestival.com/">Tickets for Governors Ball</a> will be on sale as of this Friday, January 6th, at 12 noon.</p>

<p>This year the fest will also feature redesigned &quot;VIP amenities and locations, a signature lineup of the best food NYC has to offer&quot; (with help from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517145539/https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york">the Infatuation</a>), as well as &quot;an expanded selection of craft beer options, and the lawn games, mini golf (two unique 18 hole courses), street art, and an After Dark concert series.&quot;</p>
