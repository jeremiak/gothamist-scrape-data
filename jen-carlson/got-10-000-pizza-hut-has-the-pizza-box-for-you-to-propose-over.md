<p>Was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504062933/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/white_castle_valentines_reservation.php">White Castle</a> all booked up when you went to make your Valentine&apos;s Day reservation? Fear not, fast food loving Romeo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504062933/http://www.pizzahut.com/proposal.html">Pizza Hut has got you covered</a>. Because if you have $10,010 to drop on a proposal, obviously Pizza Hut should be your first choice. Is that what you are thinking right now? That there is probably nowhere else your future bride would rather be proposed to than over a lukewarm $10 pizza? Seriously dude, you can&apos;t think of <em>one</em> better place? Fine. Let&apos;s do this...</p>

<p>The chain says they&apos;ll pick ten &quot;pizza-loving lovers&quot; who will win the chance to spend $10,010, on their $10 Dinner Box Proposal Package. Here&apos;s what the proposal package includes:</p>

<ul><li>One ruby engagement ring
</li><li>Limo service
</li><li>Flowers
</li><li>Fireworks show
</li><li>Photographer
</li><li>Videographer
</li><li>$10 Dinner Box (one medium one-topping rectangular pan pizza, five breadsticks with marinara sauce and 10 cinnamon sticks with a sweet icing cup)</li></ul>

<p>The sweet icing cup is probably PERFECT for hiding the ring in, but a little obvious, don&apos;t you think? Why not slide it under the cheese instead. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140504062933/http://www.pizzahut.com/proposal.html">enter here</a> to win the chance to purchase the world&apos;s most expensive rejection.
