Anita Jacobs is responsible for all of the programs that go along with the garden, speaking of which...</p>

<p>The two-day Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival (New York&apos;s Rite of Spring) enters its 26th year at the Garden this weekend. Just after the festival, <em>Hanami: Celebrating the Cherry Blossom Season</em> will be taking place from (April 7th to May 6th). Hanami is the Japanese name for cherry-blossom viewing, so come to the garden before the blossoms disappear! </p>

<p><strong>Tell us about Sakura Matsuri and the preparations that go on for it throughout the year.</strong>  <br>
PC: The horticulture staff is hard at work in the late winter and early spring to prepare all of the gardens at BBG for the many visitors we receive each spring.  So while the big show might be the cherry blossoms, we are pruning and planting in our other gardens and conservatories as well.  There is a lot to see here.  Our facilities department does an incredible amount of work also.  </p>

<p>AJ: Sakura is such a fun festival to put together.  I get a kick out the being able to program very traditional Japanese folk dances on the same stage as edgy J-pop from Tokyo.  Everywhere you look during the festival you can see pink-haired girls posing next to women with wooden geta shoes and vintage kimonos. This year we have nearly two dozen new performances and presentations.  I&apos;m really thrilled to introduce our first-ever manga library, put on by the folks who do the AnimeNEXT convention.  Manga and anime are the gateway to Japanese culture for a lot of people around the world, and already we&apos;ve seen a few blogs where folks chatted first about what Cos-Play costumes they were going to wear to the festival and then later made plans to check out a traditional tea ceremony or presentation about the Art of Geisha.  Essentially, I spend about eight months programming and planning for Sakura and then just sit back and let the cherry blossoms do the rest! <br>
 <br>
<strong>When do the trees look their best?</strong> <br>
PC: Different cherries bloom at different times and the timing is all up to Mother Nature.  Generally, the cherry blossoms here are best perceived as a progression.  The show usually begins in early April with the Okame and (weeping)  Higan cherries.  As they are approaching peak bloom, the Yoshino cherries and others like them hit their stride.  A wide number of Japanese flowering cherries&#x2014;with variety names like Ukon and Shirotae&#x2014;then follow, and the show winds up with the Kanzan cherries at the end of April/beginning of May.  When you factor in, as the Japanese do, the cherries&#x2019; bud stage and the point where petals fall like snow, then you have a show that lasts five weeks or so.  This cherry viewing period is known as Hanami. <br>
 <br>
<strong>What&apos;s it like working in a garden in an urban area? </strong><br>
PC: I love it.  We get enthusiastic visitors from the many different surrounding the Garden, from across New York, and from around the world.  The City itself lends both vitality and emphasis to the Garden, and the Garden returns the favor by serving to ease the encroachments that can come with urban life.  For example, if you&#x2019;re standing in the Japanese Garden, you can hear traffic on Washington Avenue if you try, but you&#x2019;re more likely to have your attention grabbed by the garden&#x2019;s beauty.  In the Native Flora Garden, which borders Flatbush Avenue, you are more likely to hear bird songs than cars. </p>

<p>AJ: When my friends complain about battling rush hour crowds in the city I end up rubbing salt in their wounds by mentioning that I often have to yield to a red-tailed hawk or a line of baby ducklings&#x2026;I am a real nature addict, so being able throw open the door and be surrounded by dozens of blooming magnolia trees is a dream.   </p>
