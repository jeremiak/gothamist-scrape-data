<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="php1nTBpeAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144459im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php1nTBpeAM.jpg" width="288" height="350"> <br> <i style=" width:288px; ;display:block"> Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144459/http://GoingWithEddie.com/">GoingWithEddie.com</a></i></div> Yesterday Beyonce hit Coney Island with photographer Terry Richardson to shoot her new music video, which will feature the singer on some of the area&apos;s famous rides, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144459/http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BS6s6EKCYAA20tP.png">also maybe twerking</a>? <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144459/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/beyonce-rides-coney-island-cyclone-article-1.1441216">the Daily News</a>, fans who witnessed the spectacle loved it hated it loved it hated it...</p>

<p>The paper notes that &quot;fans around were aggravated that they got nothing,&quot; but also that &quot;Beyonce took time to greet fans [and] it was her fans who got the thrill.&quot; Guess we&apos;ll never truly know how her fans really felt about this! Except for one...</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144459/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ordeal_over_beyonc_aieee_ikYVQfqpjG1hTCGI2ASPtJ">The NY Post</a> found one woman who was traumatized by yesterday&apos;s events. Dorris Hone was on the Wonder Wheel, despite claiming she is deathly afraid of heights, when Beyonce&apos;s shoot took over part of the ride. The singer held up the ride, leaving the 47-year-old Hone trapped in her Wonder Wheel cage at the top for, like, 20 minutes or so&#x2014;the whole time her screams were drowned out by Beyonce&apos;s fans. She told the paper, &quot;I started freaking out. I&#x2019;m afraid of heights. I was horrified. It would be nice to get an apology from her.&#x201D;</p>

<p>All in all she was reportedly only there for 45 minutes...</p>
