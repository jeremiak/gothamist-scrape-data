</div></div>					<p>As you may have read in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075805/http://gothamist.list-manage.com/subscribe/post">our newsletter</a>, on this day in 1966 New York City experienced the smoggiest day in the city&apos;s history... and the details read like a horror movie. After 9/11, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075805/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/nyregion/you-should-have-seen-air-53-after-sept-11-considering-history-s-lessons.html?scp=8&amp;sq=smog%201966&amp;st=cse">the NY Times</a> touched upon three particularly smoggy years in the city, saying &quot;Most of the horrors of New York&apos;s environmental past, like the grim air episodes in 1953, 1962 and 1966, were chronic and cumulative. Most past events had a thousand sources and causes &#x2014; a vague diffusion of responsibility that made no one responsible.&quot; </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075805/http://washingtonpost.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/99-1257/99-1257fo5/text.html">this briefing</a>, key motivations for congressional action included a &apos;Killer Smog&apos; in London in 1962 and similar inversions in New York. In November 1953, smog killed between 170 and 260 people in NYC; 10 years later it killed 200; and in 1966 it killed 169. The 1953 smog is often mentioned in relation to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075805/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/28/dylan_thomas_is_baaaaack.php">Dylan Thomas&apos;s death</a>. He died in November of 1953, and a turning point in his health &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075805/http://www.answers.com/topic/dylan-thomas">came on November 2nd</a>, when air pollution rose to levels that were a threat to those with chest problems.&quot;</p>

<p>Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075805/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/22/new_york_is_vai.php">in 2006</a>, the EPA declared &quot;that 68 out of every million New Yorkers is at risk for getting cancer just from breathing the air.&quot; It looks like next year we can expect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075805/http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/8649/report/2008">a progress report</a> regarding air pollution in the city. In the meantime, we wonder if an upcoming season of <em>Mad Men</em> might revolve around the 1966 smog.</p>
