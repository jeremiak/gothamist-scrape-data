</div></div>					<p>Yesterday we took a look at New York City fashions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526224603/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/09/flashback_7.php">in 1969</a>, and now we jump back two decades prior to that. What were women in the city wearing in 1949? Really weird bikini tops, apparently. Click through for more fashion spotted in the city that year. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526224603/http://www.centuryinshoes.com/decades/1940/1940.html">here&apos;s a look</a> at 1940s fashion nationwide (did you know that by 1940, the average American woman owned five pairs of shoes?).</p>
