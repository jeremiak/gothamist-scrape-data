</div></div><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509160656/http://gothamist.com/tags/meninblackiii"><em>Men In Black III</em></a> will be helping to kick off summer blockbuster season on May 25th, and they&apos;ve got some unique ways to get you interested in the flick.</p>

<p>The Museum of Moving Image in Astoria is opening their Men In Black-themed exhibit today, titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509160656/http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2012/05/09/detail/aliens-gadgets-and-guns-designing-the-world-of-men-in-black-3/">Aliens, Gadgets, and Guns: Designing the World of <em>Men in Black III</em></a>, which will put you up close and personal with some alien life forms (though, sadly, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509160656/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRcUcxtaX-Q">B.Y.O.Pug</a>). This movie travels back to 1969 New York City, and that era will also be reflected at the exhibit:</p>

<blockquote>The sequences set in 1969 required that many of the props&#x2014;such as neuralyzers (memory erasers), guns, and cell phones&#x2014;be re-imagined in a retro-futuristic style. The exhibit features these and other objects made under the supervision of the film&#x2019;s property master Douglas Harlocker, including a singular &#x201C;time jump&#x201D; device used by Agent J, Men in Black binders with alien questionnaires (with real questions), an alien passport reader, and many fantastical firearms. A life-size futuristic &#x201C;monocycle&#x201D; from the film will be exhibited in the Museum&#x2019;s lobby.The selection of six alien masks also reflect the two different time periods, with some making obvious design references to how space creatures were imagined in the 1950s and &#x2018;60s.</blockquote>

<p>The show&apos;s on view through September 23rd, and on May 24th legendary makeup artist Rick Baker will appear in person at the exhibit, and for a preview screening of the movie&#x2014;he says, It&#x2019;s a true pleasure to work on a Men in Black film and I think this exhibit gives a good taste of some of the fun we have in store in the movie.&#x201D; Bonus: they tell us they &quot;are giving out the questionnaire to visitors&quot; (and you can click through to take it at home).</p>

<p>One of the first places you&apos;ll be able to catch the movie is on the Intrepid&#x2014;the museum is hosting an over-the-top party and screening for the flick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509160656/http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/mib3.aspx">on May 23rd</a>. Those willing to pay $150 will get to see the movie, then join the cast for the movie premiere after-party on the Flight Deck, where guests will be treated to enough free booze at the open bar that one may just tell you all about Scientology&apos;s secret &quot;Advanced Technology&quot; doctrines.</p>
