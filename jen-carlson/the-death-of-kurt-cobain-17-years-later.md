Alas, on this day in 1994&#x2014;seventeen years ago&#x2014;he died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound (though to be sure, if the Grunge Era had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110408073331/http://gothamist.com/tags/truthers">Truther</a> conference, it would be about the Cobain suicide). Some Cobain talking points from today:<br>
</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110408073331/http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_7818.shtml">A sculpture</a> honoring the memory of Cobain has been installed in a Washington state park next to the Young Street Bridge to observe the anniversary&#x2014;it&apos;s a large concrete guitar.<br>
</li><li>Every year since his death <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110408073331/http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2011/04/seventeen_years_after_kurt_cob.php">a group of artists</a> have presented &quot;The Smell of Teen Spirit,&quot; a live theater project commemorating his death and the &quot;impossibility of his suicide.&quot;<br>
</li><li>A theater troupe in Chicago is also working on a new production about Cobain&apos;s life, death and legacy, titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110408073331/http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/04/insight-verse-chorus-verse/">Verse Chorus Verse</a>.&quot;<br>
