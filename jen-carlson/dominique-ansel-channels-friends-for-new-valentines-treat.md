<p>Saccharine sitcom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320190106/http://gothamist.com/tags/friends"><em>Friends</em></a> and Cronut-creator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320190106/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiqueansel">Dominique Ansel</a>: together at last. The chef has created a new treat for Valentine&apos;s Day, which references one of the show&apos;s more memorable scenes, where Phoebe explains true love through lobsters. Adorkable. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320190106/http://instagram.com/p/jr9HYMlOLO/">lobster-shaped linzer cookies</a> come with a &quot;You&apos;re My Lobster&quot; note, and a rep for the bakery confirmed to us that yes, this is a nod to the below scene, adding, &quot;So very New York and nostalgic.&quot; They roll out this Friday, but remember, if you buy them for someone <em>that&apos;s it</em>. True love, forever. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320190106/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEn9YvJ3Gfg">No breaks</a>.</p>
