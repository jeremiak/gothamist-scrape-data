title: Kanye Shows Us That Scott Disick Would Actually Make A Terrible Patrick Bateman
---


                            
                            
                            
                            <p>Kim Kardashian&apos;s friend Jonathan Cheban and her sister&apos;s baby daddy Scott Disick were recently cast in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120413/http://gothamist.com/tags/americanpsycho"><em>American Psycho</em></a> parody video to promote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120413/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a>&apos;s new album. Yeezus Christ this is complicated. But what we need to focus on is Disick playing Patrick Bateman, a character he has always been compared to for his slicked back/suited up look and kind of dickish, creepy personality. So for the purpose of allowing us to see him fill the role <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120413/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2224424/Scott-Disick-tosses-cash-crowd-swigs-bottle-Vegas-club--Kourtney-Kardashian-stays-home-children.html">he was born to play</a>, we watched... and it turns out that Disick has absolutely no acting skills. This is actually the worst Patrick Bateman we&apos;ve ever seen&#x2014;he should be Patrick Bateman-ed for this portrayal. And while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120413/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/bret_easton_ellis_interview.php">Bret Easton Ellis</a> is being unusually tepid in his response to the final product, his Twitter followers have unleashed the criticism, one calling Disick&apos;s performance an &quot;epic disaster.&quot;</p>

<p>Watch him butcher Bateman&apos;s style with a high-pitched, almost-hiccuping voice.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the real thing for comparison and palate cleansing:</p>
