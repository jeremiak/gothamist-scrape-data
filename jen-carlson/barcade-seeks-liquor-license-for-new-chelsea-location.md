<p>The beloved half bar/half arcade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090209/http://gothamist.com/tags/barcade">Barcade</a> is just one liquor license away from opening their first Manhattan location. The bar originally opened its doors in Brooklyn in 2004, and then in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090209/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/photos_inside_barcade_jersey_city.php#photo-1">New Jersey</a> in 2011&#x2014;now the owners are hoping to get their liquor license approved for a new Chelsea location on West 24th Street. One of the owners, Paul Kermizian tells us, &quot;We will be on the CB4 agenda next Tuesday, January 8th, for a location in Chelsea at 148 West 24 Street.&quot; He added, &quot;We are really looking forward to being in the neighborhood. I think we&apos;ve been good neighbors at our other locations and I hope that our concept is well received and liked in Chelsea.&quot; And with that, they&apos;re seeking some community support next week:</p>
