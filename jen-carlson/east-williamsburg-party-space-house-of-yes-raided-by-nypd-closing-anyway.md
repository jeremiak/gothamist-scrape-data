These kind of illegal, DIY venues have mostly all become legal at this point, and if they haven&apos;t, The Man will come calling eventually. That&apos;s what happened at the House of Yes over the weekend.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303025127/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/speakeasy_silenced_VtyltmJVFresvVTkpN4OnO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=">the NY Post</a>, cops raided the place early Saturday morning, arresting four people for selling alcohol without a license, including manager John Politowski, bartender Samantha Isom, doorman Aaron Edwards, and security guard Robert Lasenburg.</p>

<p>The people behind the shuttered venue&#x2014;who are known for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303025127/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/photos_what_a_christmas_spectacular.php#photo-1">over the top parties</a>&#x2014;sent out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303025127/http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=cdb3bc9e37da4cb5ec3ca6825&amp;id=0ec14fa611">an email</a> this morning regarding their closing (&quot;We are closing our space with open hearts, packing up a five-year passion project fueled&quot;)... but this closing was planned. The NYPD just happened to come knocking on one of their final nights in the space. </p>

<p>They&apos;ve been actively seeking a new space in the area (&quot;4,000-7,000 square feet with over 25 feet of ceilings at market rate or lower&quot;), and promise great new things to come... maybe even great, <em>legal </em>things? We&apos;ve reached out the organizers for a comment on their future plans, as well as Saturday&apos;s bust, and will update if we hear back.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Anya of House Of Yes told us this morning that their Friday night variety show ended at 10 p.m., &quot;and then we rented the space out for a private event afterwards as we often do. There was some sort of a police altercation which we still don&apos;t know much about, but some people were apparently detained.&quot;</p>
