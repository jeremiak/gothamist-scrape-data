<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041356/http://gothamist.com/tags/zeldafitzgerald">Zelda Fitzgerald</a>&apos;s life came to an untimely end in a North Carolina asylum at the age of 47&#x2014;but had she survived, and then gone on to live an almost unbelievable, impossible amount of years, she would be <em>113 years old</em> today. So we thought we take a look at some rare footage of Zelda and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041356/http://gothamist.com/tags/fscottfitzgerald">F. Scott</a>, which can be found within this video that also includes photos of the two:</p>

<p>As you are undoubtedly <em>well aware</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041356/http://www.scottandzelda.com/">the Fitzgeralds</a> lived in New York City for some time (at the very least, you know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041356/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/zelda_the_wild_turkey_in_battery_pa.php">Zelda the Turkey</a>). The couple married at the rectory of St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral on April 3rd, 1920&#x2014;&quot;the entire wedding party consisted of 8 people... Zelda wore a suit of midnight blue with a matching hat trimmed with leather ribbons and buckles. She carried a bouquet of orchids and small white flowers. There was no music, no photographs and no luncheon afterwards.&quot; The couple also honeymooned here&#x2014;they retreated to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041356/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/26/the_kissing_room_is_returning_to_gr.php">The Biltmore</a> after their vows, but &quot;got thrown out for rowdiness and moved on to The Commodore.&quot;</p>

<p>In a letter to Isabelle Amore, F. Scott had written, &#x201C;I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity and her flaming self-respect and it&apos;s these things I&apos;d believe in even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn&apos;t all that she should be.... I love her and that&apos;s the beginning and end of everything.&quot;</p>
