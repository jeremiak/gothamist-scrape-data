<p>Locals have been rallying around The Ridgewood Theater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074943/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/17/locals_aim_to_get_ridgewood_theatre.php#photo-1">for years</a>, but even though the 1916-era space <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074943/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/ridgewood_theater.php">became a landmark</a>, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074943/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/09/ridgewood.php">still sits</a> on Myrtle Avenue abandoned. Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507074943/http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2012/39/ridgewoodtheater_fh_2012_09_27_q.html">Times Ledger</a> reports that the current owner is marketing it as a concert venue and events space.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the building says, &#x201C;We have been marking the property for a little over a month and since then have had a lot of interest.&quot; While the space would easily transition into a venue, they are willing to hear all proposals. As a venue, it could have a capacity of somewhere between 1,900 and 2,500.</p>

<p>Theodore Renz of the Myrtle Avenue BID believes a venue in the area would be &quot;wonderful,&quot; and we&apos;d have to agree. Having lived a few blocks from the space, we can say that stretch of Myrtle Avenue, and much of the neighborhood, is in <em>desperate</em> need of something that isn&apos;t a 99 cent store. It&apos;s just about 2 blocks from the Myrtle-Wyckoff L stop, and about 4 blocks from the Seneca Avenue M stop... paging Bowery Presents!</p>
