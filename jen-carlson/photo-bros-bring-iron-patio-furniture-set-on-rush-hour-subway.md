<p>In what may possibly be the Biggest Subway Douchery Act Of The Season, several carefree bros were spotted transporting their iron patio furniture on a packed 1 train during rush hour yesterday. Let&apos;s collectively wag our fingers at them:</p>

<p>Listen bros, we know you need a nice hard surface to get your flip cup game on, but <em>seriously</em> this type of behavior won&apos;t get you laid faster than those pleated pants won&apos;t get you laid.</p>

<p>The witness to this massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426194132/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> fail, Joe, says he even overheard the bros saying they didn&apos;t care if anyone said anything to them about this being an inconvenience. Sadly, no one did say anything, so it&apos;s our job to now publicly shame these bros (who we also hear are virgins).</p>
