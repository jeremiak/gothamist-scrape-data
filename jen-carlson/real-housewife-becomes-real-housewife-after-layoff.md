More shocking is that she even had a job! Seeing as how the couple spend most of their time shopping and plotting the huge renovation on their Cobble Hill home, this is just very sad news. What purpose could they possibly serve on the show now? Perhaps they can form a troupe of triste Parisian mimes with their French-speaking spawn, Francois and Johan. For now, McCord says they will still jet off to St. Barth&apos;s even though it was her salary &quot;that tended to pay for their infamous shopping sprees, not to mention the cost of their full-time nanny.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520021853/http://cobblehillblog.com/archives/1367">Cobble Hill Blog</a>]</p>
