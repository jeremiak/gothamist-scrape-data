<p>A tipster recently sent us the above photo, taken this past Saturday at the Lorimer Street / Metropolitan Avenue subway station in Williamsburg <em>of course</em>&#x2014;she writes:</p><blockquote>&quot;I was among 10 other people taking pictures right behind the girl as she was walking out. She didn&apos;t seem to pay attention at all to the paparazzi style chase going after her. <p></p>

<p>When I first noticed it I was 3 feet away and I literally froze for a second when I realized there was a snake so close to me. To be honest I freaked out a little bit and took three steps back&#x2014;it was so unexpected. The feeling of nausea followed as my brain was trying to make sense of this.</p>

<p>If there is a rule for dogs to be in a some sort of carrier there has to be a rule for reptiles as well.&quot;</p></blockquote>We&apos;ll let you quote Samuel L. Jackson in the comments, but first we&apos;d like to point out that <em>also pictured</em> here are a leather fanny pack, a leather backpack, a leather handbag, arm sleeves, leather gladiator shoes, a lot of black, a lot of anger, probably an iPod filled with early NIN and Tori Amos, and some dark and rebellious teenage years <em>someone</em> is unable to let go of. And a dude&#x2014;wearing an ill-fitting fedora and rolled up pants for some reason&#x2014;who&apos;s just <em>really into that shit.</em><p></p>
