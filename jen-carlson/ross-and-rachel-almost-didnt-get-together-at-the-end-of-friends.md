We couldn&apos;t remember either, so this alternate ending <em>bombshell</em> isn&apos;t really blowing our minds. Turns out that a <em>Friends</em> Blu-ray set is coming out next month, and in an effort to get all the <em>Friends</em>heads excited, producer David Crane has leaked one thing that he reveals in the exclusive Blu-ray offerings: &#x201C;At first we thought that [getting Ross and Rachel together] seems so expected,&quot; and an alternative, more &#x201C;vague&#x201D; ending was in place. </p>

<p>That&apos;s right: a group of television writers had thought of more than one scenario! As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233050/http://videogum.com/602651/the-one-where-friends-almost-ended-sadly/behind-the-scenes/">Videogum</a> points out, &quot;Relax David Crane. Your show wasn&#x2019;t <em>Lost</em>... It wasn&#x2019;t <em>The X-Files</em> or <em>Twin Peaks</em>. It was <em>Friends</em>! Give us that sweet sweet candy milk that we need to feel like our lives are OK for two seconds!&quot; And besides, them not getting together would have totally blown Phoebe&apos;s ironclad lobster theory.</p>
