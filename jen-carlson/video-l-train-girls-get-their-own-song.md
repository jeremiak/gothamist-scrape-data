<p><em>Finally</em> the girls riding the L train are being serenaded to, or perhaps made fun of, it&apos;s hard to tell in this age of irony. Anyway, the below song (titled &quot;L Train Girl&quot;) is courtesy of Zac Mering and Tyler Thacker, known together as Greatest Hits. Are you a girl riding the L train in Manhattan? Well, this isn&apos;t for you; the song namechecks the Bedford, Lorimer, Graham, Grand, Montrose, and Morgan stops.</p>
