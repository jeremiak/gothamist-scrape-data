										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154009/http://www.improveverywhere.com/2008/01/31/frozen-grand-central">Improv Everywhere</a> was back recently causing a commotion (or more appropriately: a standstill) at Grand Central. For this prank the troupe had 207 &quot;agents&quot; in place that all froze on cue for five minutes. (We&apos;d love to see this go down in Times Square.) The below footage shows the latest stunt:</p>

<p>The onlookers prove to be equally entertaining, and didn&apos;t know what to think (protest? acting class?). One employee trying to move his cart through the terminal has to radio in for help: &quot;I can&apos;t move my cart, there&apos;s hundreds of people frozen everywhere. This is wild. I need some help.&quot; Improv Everywhere: making the commute more interesting.</p>
