title: Times Square: You're On Rihanna Alert!

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="rihannaalert1110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145052im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/rihannaalert1110.jpg" width="125" height="100" class="image-right"> </span>Rihanna will be performing a few songs in Times Square tonight at 5:25 p.m.&#x2014;making for a more chaotic commute home for those who have to travel through the Crossroads of the World. The stage will be set up on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd streets, and the singer is expected to perform 3 songs... but with Jay-Z nearby giving a talk at the New York Public Library later, maybe there will be a surprise encore. (We&apos;re told the show is the first live performance for MTV&#x2019;s new afternoon series, The Seven.)</p>
