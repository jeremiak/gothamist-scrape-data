But now he&apos;s taking it all back, or at least the part about the series ending; on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174048/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/alec-baldwin-30-rock_b_845993.html">his HuffPo blog</a> this morning, he wrote, &quot;Gosh. I want to take the opportunity to state that although my days on network TV may be numbered, I hope <em>30 Rock</em> goes on forever. Or at least as long as everyone involved desires. Here&apos;s to five more seasons.&quot;</p>

<p>Can the show last without Jack Donaghy, though? He offers up some plot developments for after his departure, saying, &quot;Kenneth can run the network. Jenna will get her own talk show. Tracy will become Mayor of New York. Then resign to go raise exotic reptiles. And Lemon will go do... just about anything she sets her mind to.&quot;</p>

<p>The actress that plays Liz Lemon, Tina Fey, is currently doing something her character may never get to do: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174048/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20479888,00.html">having a (second) baby</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174048/http://www.hulu.com/watch/212708/30-rock-%C2%A1que-sorpresa">Qu&#xE9; Sorpresa!</a> During a taping of <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>, which will air on the 12th, she revealed that she&apos;s five months pregnant. This could be a sign that she&apos;s ready to leave a television schedule as well... which means the show may need a recurring role from this guy to save it!:</p>

<p>(P.S. You can catch Fey in person tomorrow at her Union Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174048/http://www.unionsquarenyc.org/explore/events/1930-author-event-tina-fey-barnes-noble">book reading</a>!)</p>
