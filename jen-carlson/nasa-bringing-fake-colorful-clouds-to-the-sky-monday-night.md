<p>Don&apos;t be alarmed if you see some unusual clouds in the sky on Monday night, it&apos;s just a little barium, strontium, and cupric-oxide gas. NASA will be releasing canisters of the stuff between 9:04 and 9:19 EST, creating &quot;vapor tracers&quot; in the sky that will look like red, blue and green clouds to those on earth. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212210/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/colorful-clouds-to-dot-east-coast-skies-after-nasa-rocket-launch-on-sunday/70001915">Weather.com</a>, the artificial clouds&#x2014;delivered 100 miles up via a rocket launch at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia&#x2014;should be visible from New York to North Carolina.</p>

<p>Why? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212210/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/wallops/2017/nasa-sounding-rocket-will-release-early-morning-artificial-clouds0lighting-up-the-mid-atlantic-coast-may-31/">According to NASA officials</a>, &quot;These clouds, or vapor tracers, allow scientists on the ground to visually track particle motions in space.&quot;</p>

<p>There be a livestream hosted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212210/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-tv-wallops">at this link</a>.</p>
