<span class="photo_caption">Ramps at yesterday&apos;s Union Square Greenmarket (Anna Hiatt/Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>Yesterday was the unofficial start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428102807/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/ahoy_the_first_day_of_ramps_season.php#photo-1">to ramps season</a> (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428102807/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/ny_times_drops_two_stars_on_roberta.php">Roberta&apos;s</a> has been serving up the stuff on their pizza since March 23rd!)&#x2014;and this year we&apos;re seeing the traditionally &quot;alt&quot; ramps crossover to mainstream America. Will ramps stay relevant?!</p>

<p>This morning we received a press release from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428102807/http://www.choptsalad.com/">Chop&apos;t</a> announcing their own Ramp Vinaigrette, which is coming to their menu soon. They tell us the limited edition offering will be available in stores from April 9th through April 29th (find a location near you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428102807/http://www.choptsalad.com/StoreLocator/StoreLocator.aspx">here</a>). There will be no additional cost for the specialty vinaigrette, and you&apos;ll also have the option to take home a bottle of it for $4.99. We approve! </p>

<p>But is this the first time the beloved ramp has shown up on a chain restaurant&apos;s menu, and will McDonald&apos;s soon be announcing a McRamp sandwich? Color us intrigued, if not a little bit scared.</p>

<p>To make your own Ramp Vinaigrette, you can follow this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428102807/http://www.redbookmag.com/recipes-home/blogs/cooking/ramp-vinaigrette-recipe">Redbook</a> recipe:</p>
