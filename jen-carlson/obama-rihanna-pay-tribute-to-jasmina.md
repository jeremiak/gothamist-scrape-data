In a statement, he said Jasmina &quot;showed tremendous bravery in the face of adversity, and her ability to stay positive throughout her battle was an inspiration to me and to all those she touched.&quot;</p>

<p>Singer Rihanna, who urged others to donate bone marrow last year, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145055/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1246941/Jasmina-Anema-Rihanna-President-Obama-pay-tribute-year-old-leukemia-victim.html">made a statement</a>, saying: &quot;I am incredibly heartbroken that Jasmina has passed away. She was such a brave and special child. She showed me more strength and spirit that many adults I have met. I feel blessed that I was able to have her in my life and know that through her example, she has saved many lives. She was truly an angel on earth.&quot; </p>

<p>Jasmina died Wednesday night in Manhattan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145055/http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jasmina/journal">Her blog</a> has now been updated to read: &quot;Jasmina had a wonderful life and we thank each and every person who showed kindness and love over the years. Your endless support through this entire process has been invaluable.&quot; The family is in the process of making arrangements, and ask that in lieu of flowers and to show your support, please make any contributions to: OneForJasmina, P.O.Box 295, New York, NY 10276.</p>
