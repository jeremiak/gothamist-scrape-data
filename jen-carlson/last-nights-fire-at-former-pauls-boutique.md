As we noted in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831041036/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php">NYC Album Art</a> series, the shot was taken at 99 Rivington Street, where Rivington and Ludlow intersect. The storefront has had many incarnations, including a restaurant a few years ago called Paul&apos;s Boutique&#x2014;an homage to the album. Well, currently it&apos;s a joint called Three Monkeys, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831041036/http://evgrieve.com/2011/01/pauls-boutique-burns-down-on-lower-east.html">EV Grieve</a>, last night eyewitness reports came in declaring, &quot;it just burned down.&quot; <p></p>

<p>At 8:30 last night we received word from the newswire that &quot;all hands working for fire on the 1st floor restaurant of a 6 story. Req for board of health and placed fire.&quot; No injuries have been reported, and it&apos;s unclear at this time how extensive the damages are. Locals, who have been complaining about the noise levels there, seem to be taking it in stride, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831041036/http://twitter.com/#!/poswald/statuses/28314323520593920">one Tweeting</a>, &quot;I just learned that NYC&apos;s Three Monkeys (n&#xE9;e Paul&apos;s Boutique) burned down. As long as it didn&apos;t spread to Verlaine, I&apos;m ok.&quot;</p>
