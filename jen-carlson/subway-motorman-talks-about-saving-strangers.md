<p>We&apos;ve heard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407143747/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/30/subway_hero_2.php">from subway hero</a> Carlos Flores and the man he saved, Thomas Grant...and now the subway train motorman is speaking! Edson Braham told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407143747/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/12/01/2010-12-01_dramatic_answer_to_motormans_prayer.html">the Daily News</a> he says a prayer each day before work: &quot;Please, God, may no one get hurt as I do my job.&quot; On Sunday his prayer <em>almost</em> went unanswered, however, when Grant fell on to the tracks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407143747/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/29/nycs_got_a_new_subway_hero.php">Almost instantly Flores jumped down to save him</a>, and a bystander ran to alert the station agent of the situation (surely we&apos;ll be hearing from those two next), but Flores was running out of time to get himself off the roadbed. </p>

<p>Braham says, &quot;I was halfway between 110th St. and 103rd St. and my control center called me on the radio, telling me I should &apos;stop and stay, stop and stay.&apos; It was urgent... the last thing I wanted was to run someone over or to hurt someone. We all fear that. That&apos;s a fear that all train operators have.&quot; He was able to stop in time, just 30-feet from Flores; normally he says he would have been traveling at about 25 mph. </p>

<p>The paper points out that last year 44 people lost their lives on the subway tracks, and the motorman explains, &quot;For my fellow employees who have experienced that, it&apos;s a life-long image and memory that never fades. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been told.&quot; Needless to say, he is happy that some New Yorkers took the &quot;opportunity to change that gentleman&apos;s destiny by action.&quot;</p>
