<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502003056/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> rolling out a month long, open air street art residency here in New York, it&apos;s prime time for Fakesy pieces to go up, and for those less schooled in street art to declare pieces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502003056/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/13/nick_walker_or.php#photo-1">by Nick Walker</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502003056/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/some_pieces_that_could_be_banksys_b.php#photo-1">et al</a>, to be Banksy. Earlier today a tipster sent us in the above photo, which we believed <em>wasn&apos;t</em> a Banksy... but there&apos;s some debate online.</p>

<p>Our resident street art expert Jake Dobkin points out: &quot;The font is Banksy, but that could easily be faked... but he&apos;s done plenty of dogs and plenty of silhouettes.&quot;</p>

<p>The piece, which is at 6th and 24th, is not on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502003056/http://instagram.com/banksyny">Banksy&apos;s Instagram</a>, where his two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502003056/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/new_banksy_on_the_westside.php#photo-1">confirmed</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502003056/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/banksys_back_in_nyc_for_octoberfirs.php#photo-1">pieces</a> have been posted.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502003056/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/photos_this_is_a_banksy_piece.php">Looks like it might be REAL</a>.</p>
