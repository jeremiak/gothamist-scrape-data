<p>Emma Roberts had A Moment outside of Dominique Ansel Bakery yesterday when she allegedly tried to cut the line to get her hands on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000505/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronuts">a precious Cronut</a>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000505/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2387306/Emma-Roberts-turned-away-bakery-trying-queue-jump-popular-Cronut.html">the Daily Mail</a>&#x2014;who have published a series of photographs of the actress trying to wave her magic Celebrity Wand to get in&#x2014;the 22-year-old was denied. After Roberts (niece of Julia, btw) and her publicist &quot;attempted to skip to the front, [they] were sent to the back of the line by the doorman.&quot;</p>

<p>Later that night she told Jimmy Fallon that she simply didn&apos;t realize there was a line because why would a Famous Person recognize what a line looks like? She told the <em>Late Night</em> host: &quot;Today I went to the bakery to get a Cronut, and I was like &quot;Oh my God there&apos;s no line. And I walk in and they&apos;re like, &apos;Um the line is actually down the block.&apos; So I walked out and I waited and waited and then they were like &apos;Sorry there&apos;s no more Cronuts.&apos; It&apos;s serious business over there.&quot;</p>

<p>But her tragic tale had a happy ending...</p>

<p>Turns out all you need to do to get a Cronut is star in <em>Hotel For Dogs</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000505/http://www.tmz.com/2013/07/16/emma-roberts-domestic-violence-arrest-evan-peters-montreal/">beat your boyfriend</a>, go on Fallon, and have him present you with one on a silver platter.</p>

<p>We reached out to the bakery for their comment on this type of behavior, and Ansel told us: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;We appreciate all our customers&#x2014;celebrity or not&#x2014;and service each one the best we can. The celebrity clientele that we&apos;ve had have all been very proper. Most of them have assistants who call in advance for a pre-orders, and wait in line fairly like everyone else. And we appreciate that.

<p>Have we made exceptions for people? Yes, every business has. But in the case where I make exceptions, I take the responsibility for it and wake up an hour earlier (i.e. 2 a.m.) to make extra for those orders so as not to hurt the overall inventory for the customers in line. We promise them a certain amount of Cronuts to our fans, and will deliver that daily.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000505/https://twitter.com/RobertsEmma/status/365872453941080064">Roberts has embarked</a> on a hashtag mission (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000505/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nocronutcut&amp;src=hash">#nocronutcut</a>) to clear her name.</p>
