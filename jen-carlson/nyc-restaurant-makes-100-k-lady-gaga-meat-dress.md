The proprietor at the restaurant, Marc Sherry, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161019091833/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/27/2010-10-27_local_steakhouse_creates_100000_version_of_lady_gaga_meat_costume_waitress_model.html">the Daily News</a> that Gaga&apos;s VMA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161019091833/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/lady_gaga_distracts_from_scandal_wi.php">meat dress</a> was &quot;very tacky,&quot; and he&apos;s created a new one which one &quot;lucky lady&quot; can procure for just $100,000.</p>

<p>While Gaga&apos;s dress was made of flank steaks, Sherry&apos;s was stitched from USDA prime porterhouse, leggings from rib eye and kobe beef boots. Yep, nothing says <em>not tacky at all</em> like a knock-off that includes a Flintstones-esque bone necklace. There&apos;s also a goodie bag for the gal who goes gaga over the garment, filled with filet mignon, chocolate sauce, kobe burgers and candy corn. And of course, the entire dress can be eaten as well, if you have no problems eating something that&apos;s been worn by one of the waitresses. </p>

<p>Sherry suggests, &quot;Wear it for an hour, have fun with it... Then you might have enough meat for six months for your freezer. So that the $100,000 is not that expensive.&quot;</p>
