<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cookiesapp0112.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604071215im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cookiesapp0112.jpg" width="640" height="449" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604071215/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/girl_scout_cookies.php">the past</a>, we&apos;ve turned directly to Girl Scout HQ to find out where to procure cookies, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604071215/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/your_guide_to_getting_girl_scout_co.php">last year</a> it got even EASIER. Which is good, because this year we want to buy more than ever, just to go against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604071215/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/11/teenage_girl_spews_horrible_rant_ag.php">this closed-minded boycott</a>. We might even try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604071215/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/05/new_girl_scout_cookie.php">the new Savannah Smiles cookie</a>, who knows, <em>the sky&apos;s the limit.</em></p>

<p>The girls in green introduced an app <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604071215/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/your_guide_to_getting_girl_scout_co.php">last year</a>, and it&apos;s still up and running. You can get the Girl Scout Cookie Locator App for your iPhone, iPad, or Android, and it&apos;s free. Right now, if you go on, it will tell you Cookie Season starts in 44 days in New York, and to check back. In the meantime, avoid the &quot;nutritional info&quot; section of the app, but explore the recipes&#x2014;did you know you can make Samoas Trail Mix?</p>
