<p>James Turrell hasn&apos;t had a solo presentation in a New York museum since 1980, but now he&apos;s come back big with a new site-specific installation for the Guggenheim rotunda, called <em>Aten Reign</em> (presented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152501/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/james-turrell">along with</a> some of his early works). The piece will transform the rotunda into a light installation starting tomorrow (the summer solstice), and running through September 25th. Today, they turned on the lights for a press preview, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152501/https://twitter.com/Guggenheim/status/347733096638066688">Turrell explained</a> that &quot;the Guggenheim skyspace will change throughout different times of the day, as daylight enters the oculus.&quot;</p>

<p>The artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152501/https://twitter.com/Guggenheim/status/347731814003113984">also noted</a> that the viewer should remember: &quot;the history of art has been full of artists who have depicted light, but I decided to pursue light itself.&quot; This pursuit of light takes the form of &quot;shifting natural and artificial light and intense, modulating color, creating a dynamic perceptual experience...&quot; but you really need to see it for yourself.</p>

<p>There were no photos or video allowed at this afternoon&apos;s preview, but The Internet has magically provided anyway. Sadly, The Internet didn&apos;t provide any Vines, but here&apos;s a short video on the installation, where you&apos;ll get a glimpse: </p>
