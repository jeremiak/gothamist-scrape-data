<p>The Moth Ball&#x2014;also known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145000/http://gothamist.com/tags/themothball">the only event we look forward to every year</a>&#x2014;is coming back to the Bowery next month. The annual affair, taking place on May 10th, will return Capitale and operate under the theme: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145000/https://themoth.org/events/oh-you-pretty-things-the-2016-moth-ball">Oh! You Pretty Things</a>&quot; (celebrating all things glam and rock). Appropriately, this year&apos;s Ball will honor riot grrrl, actress, and author Carrie Brownstein. (Previous honorees have included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145000/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/louis_ck_the_moth.php#photo-1">Louis C.K.</a>, Zadie Smith, Albert Maysles, and Martin Scorsese.)</p>

<p>What to expect: <br>
</p><ul><li>A host! This year that will be Baratunde Thurston.<br>
</li><li>A silent auction, with items like: Guns n&apos; Roses tickets to their sold-out Met Life Stadium show; a drink and a dilemma with pop culture icon Molly Ringwald; a chat over lunch with Cheech Marin. Who else would offer these things up but the Moth?<br>
</li><li>Drinks! Seriously there are so many drinks at these things, and they&apos;re not very difficult to attain as there are a number of (open) bars set up around the venue.<br>
</li><li>Food. Eat it if you want to be able to enjoy all of the aforementioned drinks.<br>
</li><li>Stories: duh. There will be stories from Baratunde, Carrie, and last year&apos;s GrandSLAM champs (who will deliver a one-minute version of their winning tales).<br>
</li><li>Costumes (people really go all out for this). According to the press release, you are encouraged to &quot;don fabulous fashions inspired by the likes of Ziggy Stardust, Iggy Pop and Candy Darling&#x2014;celebrating a time of androgyny and individuality, and music underlined with lipstick and strength.&quot; BYO-costume, but they usually have some accessories to add to your attire&#x2014;we&apos;re told there will be a temporary tattoo booth, too.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>All proceeds go to The Moth, which is a fantastic organization that, if I were a wealthy eccentric, would leave all of my fortunes to.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145000/https://themoth.secure.force.com/ticket/#sections_a0FU000000CspGtMAJ">buy tickets here</a>&#x2014;they range from $500 (cocktails, dinner, stories &amp; dancing) to $15,000 (table seating for 12, VIP service, premium program listing, full-page ad). It may sound like a lot of money, but honestly this one night out (which ends with a gift bag) is worth skipping several mediocre nights out for.</p>
