Okay, <em>indie</em> rock stars...who haven&apos;t quite broken out of their downtown bubble yet.</p>

<p>First up on Indie Cribz (it&apos;s really called that): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424022333/http://www.myspace.com/teamrobespierre">Team Robespierre</a>. Mediocre band, amazing &quot;semi-legal&quot; apartment story. </p>

<p>Bassist of the band, Mike House, lives in a former squat on 9th Street between Avenues C and D. In 2002 Giuliani sold the former squat to a non-profit housing corporation called the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board; someday (over the rainbow) the 20 residents will apparently own their apartments. Currently Mr. House pays 70 bucks a month to live &quot;where the magic happens.&quot; </p>
