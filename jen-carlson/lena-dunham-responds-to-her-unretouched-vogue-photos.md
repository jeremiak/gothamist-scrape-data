<p>Earlier this week Vogue&apos;s Lena Dunham photo spread was placed in the hands of The Internet, where everyone is so loving and nice and kind. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706204251/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/how_much_did_vogue_photoshop_lena_d.php">It didn&apos;t really seem that Photoshopped</a> to us, but Jezebel put a bounty out for the unretouched photos in order to see how much Vogue messed with her body. As they do with all bodies appearing in their pages. For $10,000, they got what they asked for, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706204251/http://jezebel.com/here-are-the-unretouched-images-from-lena-dunhams-vogu-1503336657">published the unretouched images today</a>. While some of Dunham&apos;s finest work to date is in her subtweets to Jezebel, she has also now officially spoken about the matter...</p>

<p>She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706204251/http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/01/17/lena_dunham_response_to_vogue_photoshop_criticism_fashion_magazines_are.html">told Slate</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I understand that for people there is a contradiction between what I do and being on the cover of Vogue; but frankly I really don&#x2019;t know what the photoshopping situation is, I can&#x2019;t look at myself really objectively in that way. I know that I felt really like Vogue supported me and wanted to put a depiction of me on the cover. I never felt bullied into anything; I felt really happy because they dressed me and styled me in a way that really reflects who I am. And I felt that was very lucky and that all the editors understood my persona, my creativity and who I am. I haven&#x2019;t been keeping track of all the reactions, but I know some people have been very angry about the cover and that confuses me a little. I don&#x2019;t understand why, photoshop or no, having a woman who is different than the typical Vogue cover girl, could be a bad thing.

<p>A fashion magazine is like a beautiful fantasy. Vogue isn&#x2019;t the place that we go to look at realistic women, Vogue is the place that we go to look at beautiful clothes and fancy places and escapism and so I feel like if the story reflects me and I happen to be wearing a beautiful Prada dress and surrounded by beautiful men and dogs, what&#x2019;s the problem? If they want to see what I really look like go watch the show that I make every single week.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, Jezebel has dutifully called out magazines for Photoshopping for years, and they state their problem is with Anna Wintour and Vogue giving digital makeovers that in turn may be giving some impressionable women an unrealistic standard to live up to. Meanwhile, Mother Jones&apos; co-editor Clara Jeffery expressed another concern on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706204251/https://twitter.com/ClaraJeffery">Twitter</a>: &quot;If [Lena]&apos;s given us an image of a real woman on <em>Girls</em>, and they altered&#x2014;perhaps without her consent, isn&apos;t that a paradox that should be explored?&quot;</p>

<p>And Vogue is calling out Jezebel for claiming the entire Brooklyn street scene with the pigeon was fake, with this: </p>
