<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="steindaughter1109.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135354im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/steindaughter1109.jpg" width="255" height="230" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s been just over two years since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135354/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindastein">Linda Stein</a> was murdered in her apartment on the Upper East Side. Her assistant Natavia Lowery was charged with the crime and has been in custody since&#x2014;and now Stein&apos;s two daughters are suing Prudential Douglas Elliman brokerage for hiring her in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135354/http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/linda-stein-s-daughters-sue-elliman-for-mother-s-wrongful-death">The Real Deal</a> reports that Samantha Wells and Mandy Stein &quot;allege in a new wrongful death lawsuit that the city&apos;s largest residential brokerage hired Natavia Lowery, their mother&apos;s personal and work assistant, despite several arrest warrants having been filed against her.&quot; They believe the company should have hired from within and not gone through a job placement agency (who is also named in the suit).<br>
 <br>
According to the lawsuit, Lowery told Stein&apos;s supervisor, an executive vice president at Elliman, that she was unhappy working for Stein &#x2014; who was never informed of the complaint. The lawsuit was filed on October 30th, which was exactly two years after the murder, and just in time &quot;because in most instances in New York, a wrongful death lawsuit must be filed within two years of the date of death.&quot;</p>
