Ever since first spotting the truck in DUMBO last Thursday we&apos;ve been stalking it&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140829033448/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/dels.php"><em>Del&apos;s is a very big deal</em></a>&#x2014;and today we finally got our first taste of a New York City-blend.<p></p>

<p>You see, the frozen treat isn&apos;t always replicated the right way&#x2014;we&apos;ve heard horror stories about one California-based Del&apos;s where owners didn&apos;t use the real Rhody recipe. They eventually shut down operations after just one summer. So we&apos;re happy to report that this truck is slinging the real deal slush, with the original mix <em>and</em> real pieces of lemon&#x2014;owner Cam Crockford is Rhode Island born and bred, so that is definitely a winning factor.</p>

<p>We caught up with Crockford in Brooklyn this morning and he gave us four tall cups of the frozen stuff. Here&apos;s what my coworker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140829033448/http://twitter.com/jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a>, who had never had a Del&apos;s before today, had to say: <strong>&quot;That was a real deal slushee&#x2014;perfect icey consistency all the way to the bottom, delicious chunks of lemon rind, sweet but not too sweet.</strong> I feel awake and alive&#x2014;like I just got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140829033448/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/20/unpacking_last_nights_mad_men_2.php">a B12 shot</a>!&quot;</p>

<p>Coworker Nell Casey asked, &quot;Do I eat this with a spoon or use a straw?&quot; The answer is: both! In fact, Cam will hook you up with a straw that has a spoon shape at the bottom of it. Though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140829033448/http://www.dels.com/Flavors.aspx">Del&apos;s officially recommends</a> sipping it straight from the cup:</p><ul><li>Shake the cup&#x2014;the heat from your hand will slowly melt the ice.<br>
</li><li>Sip right from the cup&#x2014;no straw is needed.<br>
</li><li>Repeat whenever you need an icy treat.</li></ul><p></p>
