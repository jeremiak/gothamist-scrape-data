<p>As we learned during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816223510/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/29/brooklyn_bridge_park_to_get_a_35_de.php">the frigid months of February</a>, Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s Pier 2 is getting a pool of its own. That pool will be opening today once Marty Markowitz gets over there to cut the ribbon. We took a look from the Brooklyn Promenade this morning, and wondered: why didn&apos;t they add an accompanying adult-sized pool next to the glorified kiddie pool, which is only 3.5-feet deep? And how grimy will the pool get, given that there&apos;s only a few shipping containers separating it from the churning traffic on the BQE? </p>

<p>We&apos;ve got someone on the scene at the press conference for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816223510/http://gothamist.com/tags/mccarrenparkpool">the 2nd most important public pool opening of our time</a>, and will report back with more details, and hopefully some answers.</p>

<p>Until then... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816223510/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/30/day_after_opening_mccarren_park_poo.php">Godspeed lifeguards</a>, we hear those Brooklyn Heights toddlers get cranky if they haven&apos;t had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816223510/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/brooklyn_babies_binge_on_babyccinos.php">their babyccinos</a> in the morning.</p>
