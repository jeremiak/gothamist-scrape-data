<p>Saturday Night Live <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184039/https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/658675743195557888">just announced</a> that Matthew McConaughey will return to Studio 8H to host the show on November 21st. More like Saturday Night L-I-V-I-N amirite? </p>

<p>McConaughey has hosted the show one other time, in 2003, when he was co-starring in <em>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</em>. A lot has happened since then! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184039/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1113899_1129980,00.html">Sexiest Man Alive</a>! What parts of the actor&apos;s career will be mined for creative content? Jim Carrey already addressed those Lincoln ads <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184039/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/31/videos_the_best_sketches_of_saturda.php">on the show</a>, but we&apos;ve still got the Rom Com Period, featuring <em>Failure to Launch</em>, <em>Fool&apos;s Gold</em>, <em>Ghosts of Girlfriends Past</em>). And then there&apos;s McConaughey&apos;s transition into more dramatic roles: <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em>, <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>, <em>Magic Mike</em>, <em>True Detective</em>, and <em>Interstellar</em>. </p>

<p>Adele will be the musical guest on November 21st &#x2014; this is her 2nd time, too. Prior to that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184039/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/13/donald_trump_snl.php">Donald Trump</a> is hosting on November 7th, unless Lorne Michaels decides to listen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209184039/http://pac.petitions.moveon.org/americasvoice/sign/no-room-for-hate-on-saturday">The People</a>, and a week later, on November 14th, Elizabeth Banks will host for her first time.</p>
