										<p>As if the graffiti and anti-hipster sentiments weren&apos;t enough to prove that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151920/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/staten_island.php">Staten Island</a> may indeed be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151920/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/08/staten_island_the_next_williamsburg.php">Williamsburg II</a>, the borough is raising the bar by opening up NYC&apos;s first ever tattoo museum! How hip is <em>that</em>? It&apos;s set to open this summer in a space above one-named local Dozer&apos;s Island Tattoo shop. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151920/http://www.silive.com/eastshore/index.ssf/2008/07/new_museum_coming_to_grasmere.html">The SI Advance</a> notes that the plan is &quot;to create three tableaux in the 500-square foot space, with automated mannequins depicting tattooing methods. Video and sound elements will add explanation and atmosphere to each scene.&quot; Other relics and photographs of the hundreds of firefighters who came in for their official commemorative WTC tattoos will also be on display. As a nice side note: All money from each of those tattoos has been given to firefighters and their families. Dozer is sure to be the main attraction of the museum, however, along with his 6-year-old son, who the paper claims is &quot;an aspiring gynecologist.&quot; </p>
