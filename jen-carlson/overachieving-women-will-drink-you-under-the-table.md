<p>The researchers found that women who went to university consume more alcohol than their less-educated counterparts <em>and</em> they are twice as likely to drink on a daily basis. In fact, this can all be predicted at an early age&#x2014;the study points out that schoolgirls who scored medium and high test marks are 2.1 times more likely to drink daily as adults. </p>

<p>These boozy broads also tend to postpone parental responsibilities and hold off on having children, likely work in male-dominated offices, and we&apos;re guessing have afforded themselves a life of luxury that allows them to pour only the finest Chardonnay into their coffee mugs in the morning.
