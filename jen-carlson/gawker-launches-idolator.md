										<p>Gawker&apos;s music blog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913202936/http://idolator.com/">Idolator</a>, is here. At first glance it reads like an MLB.com writer and an EW writer are attempting to write about music...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913202936/http://www.idolator.com/tunes/announcements/meet-your-editorsand-their-numerous-conflicts-of-interest-200576.php">oh, wait</a>. </p>

<p>So far they have shed light on things that already have glaring spotlights on them, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913202936/http://www.idolator.com/tunes/announcements/the-idolator-manifesto-americas-disappointing-music-nerds-200481.php">such as</a>: blogs create buzz about bands, and sometimes those bands aren&apos;t worth the buzz! Nothing new there, though they promise to step in and &quot;cover the people who are manufacturing the latest band buzz, whether it&apos;s an old-guard standby (Rolling Stone), an absurdly powerful new-media turk (Pitchfork), or an agenda-pimping blogger (take your pick).&quot;</p>

<p>They also &quot;want to steer you in the direction of a good song or artist, which we&apos;ll do every day. We aim to be discerning, but not snobby.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913202936/http://www.idolator.com/tunes/nme/where-do-we-enlist-200654.php">Today&apos;s mp3 appears to be the new My Chemical Romance song</a>. Nice one. </p>

<p>Related: According to editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913202936/http://www.myspace.com/mauradotcom  ">Maura&apos;s Myspace page</a>, she is currently listening to Andrew WK and Annie.</p>

<p>UPDATE: We agree with the Yeti, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913202936/http://noyetidance.blogspot.com/2006/09/weve-been-had.html">who has some more to add</a>. </p>
