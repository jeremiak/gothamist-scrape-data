                            <p>Recently a woman who was going to be visiting New York City from Germany emailed us asking us for the location of a scene from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044802/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakfastattiffanys"><em>Breakfast At Tiffany&apos;s</em></a>. Surprisingly, it wasn&apos;t one of the more iconic scenes, so we accepted the challenge. She wrote, &quot;I would love to know which historic landmark the actors are crossing at the enclosed picture. Do you know which building this is? In two weeks from now I plan to go to New York City on vacation, and I would love to see this place.&quot; Here&apos;s the image she attached&#x2014;if you want to guess yourself, don&apos;t scroll down below the image.</p>

<p>The building in question is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044802/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Park+and+East+52nd&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.758424,-73.972921&amp;spn=0.009476,0.016952&amp;sll=40.758390,-73.972952&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,321.79,,0,-20.76&amp;cbll=40.758427,-73.972925&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=Park+Ave+%26+E+52nd+St,+New+York,+10022&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;panoid=6vB48_3CFVpyRUWIFPgQEA">Park and East 52nd Street</a>, and now <em>soul-crushingly</em> houses a Chase Bank. But the main tenant at 370 Park Avenue is The Racquet and Tennis Club&#x2014;the private social and athletic club that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044802/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/realestate/streetscapes-racquet-tennis-club-park-ave-anomaly-dedicated-arcane-sports.html">opened in 1918</a> and <em>still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044802/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/augusta-national-now-accepts-women-all-male-nyc-clubs_n_1818998.html">doesn&apos;t allow women</a></em>. Here&apos;s what the landmarked building looked like back in the day:</p>

<p>And the fountain they sit at across the street, right after they stroll past the club, is still there!</p>
