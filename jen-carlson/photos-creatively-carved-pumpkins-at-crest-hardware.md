</div></div><p>Last night our photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111023213914/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> checked out the Crest Hardware <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111023213914/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/carve_a_pumpkin_at_crest_hardware_t.php">annual pumpkin carving contest</a>, where creative carvers created everything from Beavis and Butthead to Osama Bin Laden to Hello Kitty jack o&apos; lanterns. A reader in attendance last night tells us: </p>

<blockquote>The party was in this amazing secret-ish garden hidden inside a city block in plain site of Metropolitan Avenue. The big tree was reportedly the tree Betty Smith had in mind when she wrote &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; according to the patriarch of the family that owns the store.  They have a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig named Franklin that you could pet like a dog who has his own petting zoo corral.  They had 2 different campfires, and awesome DJ, free Tiger Beer and Bud tall-boys + rum and bar-b-que and hay bails. The pumpkins were creative and people put a lot of work into them. AND IT WAS FREE... then some asshole wrecked the port-o-let and the party was over.</blockquote>

<p>That sounds messy. Click through for photos of the pumpkins, as well as Franklin the pig! While there are no photos of the port-o-let aftermath were captured, there are a couple of classic &quot;puking pumpkin&quot; designs for a gross-out factor.</p>
