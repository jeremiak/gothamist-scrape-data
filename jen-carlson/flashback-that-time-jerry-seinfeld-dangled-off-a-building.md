                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="seinfeldvergtigo0611.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131028050552im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/seinfeldvergtigo0611.jpg" width="640" height="444" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>These photos from LIFE magazine are captioned: &quot;Comedian Jerry Seinfeld perching precariously on roof ledge overlooking Central Park.&quot; So <em>edgy!</em> The comedian probably wouldn&apos;t attempt such a stunt these days&#x2014;this photoshoot took place back in May 1990. Any guesses as to which building he was atop?</p>
