</div></div>					<p>Mike D has always had money, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304153003/http://genius.com/17325">like Charles Dickens</a>, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304153003/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/lets_not_forget_that_mike_d_has_bee.php">it wasn&apos;t really surprising</a> when the NY Times profiled his beautiful $5 million townhouse in Brooklyn back in 2013. Many gasped, however, as if they believed Mike D was just living out his years on someone&apos;s couch in the basement, eternally grasping a can of Bud, continuing to fight for his right to party... not designing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304153003/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/18/this_brooklyn_toile_wallpaper_was_c.php">his own toile wallpaper</a>. But that wallpaper, along with every detail in his Brooklyn townhouse, is gorgeous, even if not synonymous with the Beastie Boys style. And now it can all be yours.</p>

<p>Mike D <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304153003/http://www.6sqft.com/beastie-boy-mike-ds-brilliant-brooklyn-townhouse-can-be-yours-for-5-7m/">is selling</a> his townhouse in Cobble Hill for $5.6 million. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304153003/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3469129">Corcoran</a>, the home at 148 Baltic Street contains 5 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a media room, satellite kitchen, a full floor master suit, an elegant living room with a wood burning fireplace, an expansive dining room and open kitchen, outdoor dining on the deck and a staircase to the garden, a large walk-in dressing room, a freestanding tub, 9&quot; Wide Plank Floors, an In Home Theatre System, and a bunch of other rooms in which you can store your material possessions.</p>

<p>Not included in the price is that glass swing set or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304153003/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/06/check_your_bed_are_trespassing_porn.php">the amateur pornographers</a> who recently fornicated all over the home.
