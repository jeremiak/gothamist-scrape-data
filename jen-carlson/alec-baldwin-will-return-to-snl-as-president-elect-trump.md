<p>While he won&apos;t commit to playing Donald Trump for the next four years, or until whenever Trump is impeached, Alec Baldwin will return to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042946/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> stage this weekend to reprise his role as the now President-elect. (He previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042946/http://www.wnyc.org/story/alec-baldwin-sheds-trump-impressions-election-day/">told Brian Lehrer</a> he was trying to &quot;shed the Trump cloak.&quot;) </p>

<p>Since he skipped last weekend&apos;s post-election show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042946/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/06/alec_baldwin_kate_mckinnon_snl.php#photo-1">the last time</a> we saw Baldwin with his Donald wig on we were all much more hopeful that this buffoon would not be elected into the highest office. This is the first time we&apos;ll see SNL tackle Trump as the actual President-elect.</p>

<p>Baldwin told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042946/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-saturday-night-live">Vanity Fair</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m going to do it again this weekend, but not all that often.&quot; He explained, &quot;There were a lot of things online said about it&#x2014;like why didn&#x2019;t I do it after the election? I was booked [last] weekend. Not even other jobs; we have things to do. It crashes every weekend.&quot; </p>

<p>The actor has been vocal on his (two) Twitter accounts about his feelings on Trump, post-election.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On January 20, 2017, let&apos;s start counting the days that Trump betrays his working class base.</p>&#x2014; AlecBaldwin (@AlecBaldwin) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042946/https://twitter.com/AlecBaldwin/status/797444879030829056">November 12, 2016</a></blockquote>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump has yet to look happy, satisfied, triumphant. Only grim, purposeful and exhausted.<br>Did he really see this coming?</p>&#x2014; ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042946/https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/798188687385300997">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>
