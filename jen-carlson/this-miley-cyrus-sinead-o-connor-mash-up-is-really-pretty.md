<p>Was Sinead O&apos;Connor just using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119132808/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/sinead_oconnor_to_miley_cyrus_what.php">the open letter</a> to Miley Cyrus to get press for her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119132808/http://www.sineadoconnor.com/tour-dates/">upcoming tour</a>? Who knows, but we choose to believe her sentiment was a sincere (and very well put) one. Was Miley Cyrus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119132808/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/sinead_oconnor_to_miley_cyrus_what.php">really mean</a> to Sinead O&apos;Connor after the two open letters were published? Yep, but she&apos;s young and young people are often impulsive and not very nice. Were Cyrus&apos;s non-controversial, fully-clothed performances of her songs on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119132808/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/videos_saturday_night_live_turns_in.php#photo-13">this weekend&apos;s SNL</a> a mature nod of understanding in O&apos;Connor&apos;s direction? Probably not, but they did showcase her natural talent. </p>

<p>Whatever you think of their open dialogue last week, we recommend listening to this mashup from producer/DJ/remixer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119132808/http://www.crackajack.de/2013/10/07/milhead-ocyrus-nothing-compares-to-wrecking-ball/">Robin Skouteris</a>, who brought together &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; and &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; in the most perfect way possible. No more open letters, just this:</p>

<p>Now can someone mash up that acoustic &quot;We Can&apos;t Stop&quot; with &quot;The Last Day Of Our Aquaintance&quot;?</p>
