An emergency service unit was sent to track the animal down, and they cornered her in Trinity Cemetery on 155th and Broadway, where she was tranquilized. </p>

<p>The coyote is currently under evaluation by the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo. The WCS&apos;s Mary Dixon says she is about 1 or 2 years old, and following their observation the Department of Environmental Conservation will either send her to a rescue center or set her free into the wild.</p>

<p>New York City Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe says, &quot;This is actually the third coyote that has been seen in the last 10 years,&quot; and he believes they make their way from Westchester down the Amtrak rail corridor, or swim down the Hudson. One local <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430000646/http://twitter.com/misspierceful/statuses/8030003186">Twittered</a>, &quot;they callin it a coyote but i know better that was a harlem rat.&quot;</p>
