</div></div>					<p>The snow dumped on New York City overnight is really nothing compared to accumulations of the past, and we&apos;re much better prepared than Back Then. So click through and feel better about having plowed streets and not having to trudge through the piles of snow in a girdle and bustle. Although, the past does get a point for building a bar on the frozen Hudson River...</p>

<p>From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114551/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/new_yorkers_cross_frozen_east_river.php">our post last year</a> on the city&apos;s rivers freezing... and a bar being built on the North River (now the Hudson River):</p><blockquote>&quot;January 1821: Below zero temperatures and &apos;a stiff wind succeeded in packing both the East and North Rivers, the Kill von Kull, the Narrows between Staten Island and Long Island shore, and the Upper Bay between Staten Island this city with a solid mass of ice. The ice was for some time the only means of getting from New Jersey to this city. <strong>Some adventurous person built a temporary tavern on the ice on the North River, midway between New York and Hoboken, and dispensed eatables and drinkables to travelers between the two states</strong>.&apos;&quot;</blockquote><p></p>
