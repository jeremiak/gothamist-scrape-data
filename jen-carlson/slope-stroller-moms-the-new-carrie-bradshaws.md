He&apos;s &quot;teamed with Sony and NBC for a proposed series about a group of affluent characters who live in the upscale Brooklyn neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p>The same execs of the yet-to-be-titled show also brought <em>Sex and the City</em> to the small screen, a series that Brooklyn-bashed throughout its lifespan. Post-Carrie Bradshaw, however, the area has become a bustling hot spot for the 30s-crowd, stroller pushers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221446/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/29/residents_rise.php">complaining neighbors</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221446/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/13/photo_of_the_da_20.php">yuppies</a> and even the occasional hipster.</p>

<p>The show&apos;s script writer, and Park Slope resident Sue Kramer, says it&apos;s slated to be &quot;an hour-long dramedy. <strong>It takes place in Park Slope and Park Slope is one of the characters in it. Park Slope has so much juice, just like Manhattan.</strong> It&apos;s got a lot of pizzazz and energy.&quot; She&apos;s got plenty of fodder to work with, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221446/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/01/union_hall_sort.php">Strollergate</a> to the much buzzed about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519221446/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/03/park_slope_decl.php">sex toy shop</a> moving in. </p>

<p>If it gets the green light, expect it to hit airwaves by next year. Residents of the Slope have mixed feelings, CB6 member Craig Hammerman is  thrilled and envisioning shots &quot;of the Soldiers and Sailors Arch at Grand Army Plaza, and long views of the stores on Fifth and Seventh avenues.&quot; Meanwhile, some locals fear the show taking over their street, Law &amp; Order invasion-style.</p>
