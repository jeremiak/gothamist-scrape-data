</div></div><p>A few creative types found a way to work <em>with</em> the snow, instead of having it work against them. This event&#x2014;which took place after a recent snowfall, but not last night&apos;s&#x2014;was called Snow Migration, and we&apos;re told it was created by artist and costume designer Sarah McMillan. After a trip on the Staten Island ferry, participants &quot;were whisked away to a strange nature park in the middle of the night, and went on a snowy walking tour where you met fantastical creatures, like mollusks, otters, wolves, and narwhals.&quot; Photographer Tod Seelie was on hand to document, check out more of his images <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180208/http://todseelie.com/snowmigration/">here</a>.</p>
