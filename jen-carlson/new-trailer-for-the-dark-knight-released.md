<p>In March, Queens Councilman Hiram Monserrate started pushing New York to lay claim on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423034930/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/25/gotham.php">&quot;Gotham City&quot; as the official city nickname</a>. Though there has long been discussion over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423034930/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City">which city Gotham is based upon</a>, this particular movie was primarily filmed in Chicago.</p>
