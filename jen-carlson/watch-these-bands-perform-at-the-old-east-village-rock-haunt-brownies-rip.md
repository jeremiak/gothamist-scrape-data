The spot was ending &quot;its 13-year history as one of the crucial East Village rock haunts,&quot; and reopening a month later as what is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102508/http://www.yelp.com/biz/hi-fi-new-york#query:hi%20fi%20bar">Hi-Fi bar</a>. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102508/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-up-close-rock-alternatives-music-scene-migrates.html">The NY Times</a> called its closing &quot;not quite the end of the city&apos;s rock world as we know it,&quot; adding that &quot;Manhattan&apos;s downtown music scene is shrinking again, even as Brooklyn&apos;s expands.&quot; Brownies booker Eric Speck explained, &apos;&apos;Developing bands are going straight to Brooklyn. Manhattan is still the nucleus, but Brooklyn has become the breeding ground.&quot;</p>

<p>At the time, owner Mike Stuto told the paper, &quot;&apos;The music industry has disappointed me for the last 15 years, so maybe it&apos;s time I disappoint the music industry.&quot; During its time as a venue the small stage saw acts like The Strokes, Interpol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and... &quot;the New York debuts of Creed, Sugar Ray and Third Eye Blind.&quot; Let&apos;s just blame Scott Stapp for the venue&apos;s demise.</p>

<p>Here are some of the performances that were caught on tape:</p>
