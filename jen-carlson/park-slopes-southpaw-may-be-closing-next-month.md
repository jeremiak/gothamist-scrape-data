<p>Is Park Slope mainstay Southpaw closing in February? According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809082826/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/01/southpaw_closin.html">Brooklyn Vegan</a>, the venue&#x2014;which opened in 2002&#x2014;will shut its doors on February 20th. One of the bookers at the club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809082826/https://twitter.com/#!/u90soccer/status/162205912919056386">Tweeted</a>, I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m writing this. Southpaw will be closing its doors for good Feb. 20th. The venue&apos;s been sold.&quot; Which currently seems to be the main confirmation.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the owner of Southpaw to get an official confirmation, and to find out more about why they&apos;re shutting down operations&#x2014;we&apos;ll update when we hear back.</p>
