<p>Jim Power, aka the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507100137/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosaicman">Mosaic Man</a>, is the man behind the 80 colorful light poles around the East Village, a project he started 25 years ago as part of his legendary Mosaic Trail. But you probably know all of that already. What you may not know is that Power has never received funding for his public art project, and he&apos;s currently trying to change that with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507100137/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-legendary-mosaic-trail">this Indiegogo campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the designs on the lampposts have been damaged through vandalism, and &quot;only about a quarter of the lamp posts that make up the original trail are still fully intact.&quot; A little more background for the unfamiliar (and we recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507100137/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/east_village_mosaic_man_explains_wh.php">revisiting the video</a> below, as well).</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The trail of whimsical mosaic designs on lamp poles, planters, sidewalks and storefronts throughout New York City are some of the most recognizable and universally acclaimed works by a local artist. The various pieces are often dedicated to an historical event, person, or landmark, i.e. 9/11 or the former Fillmore East, or simply act as sign-posts and markers. The works are, for the most part, created using recycled materials, built to last, unique to the city, and add a great deal to the quality of life in the neighborhood. In 1988, Jim was authorized by the DOT to build up to 80 light poles. In 2004, he was inducted into the City Lore Peoples Hall of Fame and received an official proclamation from Mayor Bloomberg recognizing him for his selfless contribution to the city.&quot;</blockquote> 

<p>He&apos;s hoping to raise $80,000, and he&apos;s offering some cool gifts in return, including getting your image or brand included in one of the mosaics. The money will go towards construction and artistic materials, a team of workers to help out Power, and transportation to and from the work sites.
