<p>After some time spent travelling around America, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141302/http://guspetro.com/">Gus Petro</a> started a new project titled &quot;Merge,&quot; which brings two vastly different locations together in a series of surreal images. Petro explains, &quot;In this project two opposite places are merged into one: New York City, where, it seems like, everyone wants to live there, and Grand Canyon / Death Valley, which are unlivable.&quot;</p>

<p>He created the images using his own photographs and, of course, Photoshop. But it looks <em>so real</em>. In fact, he told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141302/http://m.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2013/07/what-it-would-look-if-you-dropped-manhattan-grand-canyon/6204/">Atlantic Cities</a>: &quot;After showing the images, most of the people who haven&apos;t been in either place thought it was real. They began questioning me where it is. I didn&apos;t expect that for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Prior to this, he offered up the photos separately in his series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141302/http://guspetro.com/empty/">Empty</a> (Grand Canyon) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141302/http://guspetro.com/dense/">Dense</a> (NYC). You can see more from his &quot;Merge&quot; series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141302/http://guspetro.com/merge/">here</a>.
