<p>We just flipped the page to the chapter we always <em>knew</em> would be written: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154723/http://gothamist.com/tags/dovcharney">Dov Charney</a> has been accused of forcing a teenage employee to perform sexual acts on him. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154723/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/08/2011-03-08_american_apparel_founder_dov_charney_accused_of_forcing_teen_employee_into_sex_a.html#ixzz1G2itCYXd">the Daily News</a>, the unnamed employee is now suing her former boss for <em>$260 million</em>, and her lawsuit claims she was held captive at his Manhattan apartment!</p>

<p>The suit was filed in Brooklyn Supreme Court this week, and charges that in April 2009, Charney invited the teen employee to his Manhattan apartment, where he was wearing nothing but underpants and she was &quot;forced her to go down on her knees just inside the front door and perform fellatio upon him... nearly suffocating her in the process.&quot; This allegedly went on for several hours, while she was &quot;held prisoner&quot; there.</p>

<p>The Dov allegedly waited until she was 18 to escalate his flirting to this physical level (according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154723/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/american_apparel_founder_turned_sh6u5Ij8RCqftvW5dsuLsN#ixzz1G2pbZopX">the Post</a>, who gives her last name as &quot;Morales,&quot; he threatened termination if she didn&apos;t perform once of legal age). As for the alleged victim, she&apos;s been &quot;diagnosed as suffering from serious psychiatric injuries from which she will never fully recover.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Charney&apos;s camp for a comment, but they&apos;re keeping mum for now.</p>
