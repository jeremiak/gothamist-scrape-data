Just one year later they are now expanding their two organic, grass-fed ice cream parlors in the borough, and adding a third in Rwanda, naturally.  With the launch of their non-profit organization <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053704/http://www.bluemarbledreams.org/">Blue Marble Dreams</a>, they&apos;ll &quot;explore the transformative potential of ice cream not just as a source of fun and joy but also as a means of sustainable economic growth in developing countries with local but underutilized dairy resources.&quot; Not only that, but they&apos;ll be doing so with eco-conscious business models. This week the two ice cream queens told us a little bit about their business, some new flavors on the way, and their plan to set up shop in Rwanda.</em></p>

<p><strong>You&apos;ve only just opened your first store in 2007, and already have a second. Have you been surprised at all by the success of the business so far?</strong> Equally surprised and inspired by the great community support in our Brooklyn neighborhoods.  We opened here because we suspected that folks would respond to the high quality product, the atmosphere we try to create, and our philosophy.  But we didn&apos;t anticipate the kind of customer loyalty and enthusiasm we&apos;ve experienced thus far.  Opening the second location felt to us like a huge risk at a time when we had only been open seven months and had yet to experience our first busy summer.  We went for it, just because our business instinct told us we couldn&apos;t walk away from the opportunity.  It&apos;s the customer support that has made us feel so relieved that in fact, the risk was worth it!</p>

<p><strong>In Boston, there&apos;s a lot of &quot;Burnt Sugar&quot; flavored ice cream. It&apos;s delicious, but nowhere to be found in New York. Would you ever consider bringing this flavor on? Alexis:</strong> Funny you should ask that!  Burnt sugar is one of my favorite flavors of all time! I used to live in Boston and would make regular treks across the Charles to Christina&apos;s (in Cambridge) for it.  They made a great burnt sugar.  We have definitely considered it, among other great flavor ideas, and hope to have it up on the menu someday soon.  </p>

<p><strong>What flavors would you like to see on the menu in the future?</strong> We are currently working on a salted caramel using the incredibly delicious organic caramel made by fellow Brooklynite, Justine Pringle of Nunu Chocolates.  We&apos;d also like to do an organic peanut butter swirled into something.  Maple has just returned to the menu, and pumpkin is just around the corner...</p>
