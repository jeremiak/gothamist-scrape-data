</div></div>					<p>As the observation of the 150th Anniversary of the sinking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150654/http://www.greenpointmonitormuseum.org/">of the USS Monitor</a> approaches (this Saturday), someone has marked the occasion by vandalizing the Brooklyn monument that celebrates the ironclad warship.</p>

<p>These photos of the vandalism have showed up on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150654/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=o.117578869809&amp;type=1">Friends of McGorlick Park Facebook page</a> yesterday. The Monitor is tied to the neighborhood because its hull was built there at the Continental Iron Works, and the ship was launched there on January 30th, 1862.</p>

<p>Phil DePaolo, a community activist in Greenpoint&#x2014;where the statue has stood since 1938&#x2014;told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150654/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/historic_klyn_icon_vandalized_i8FqTcKM4psd1b9JUY6ISM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">the NY Post</a> that the incident happened Sunday, when someone splashed the statue with buckets of white paint (not unlike the style of 2007&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150654/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/26/the_splasher_sp.php">Splasher</a>). The vandal(s) also painted the initials &quot;JJ&quot; and &quot;G&quot; on the ground near the statue.</p>

<p>The Monitor sank on December 31st, 1862 off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina during a storm&#x2014;16 of the 62 crewmen were lost.</p>
