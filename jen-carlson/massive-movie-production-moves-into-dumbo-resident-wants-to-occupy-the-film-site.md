</div></div>					<p>Earlier this year DUMBO residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713014531/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/18/dumbo_residents_still_being_held_ho.php">spoke out</a> against Hollywood infiltrating their quiet cobblestone streets, asking them to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713014531/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/11/local_dumbo_resident_to_hollywood_g.php">go back to TriBeca!</a>&quot; The DUMBO Neighborhood Alliance even asked the Mayor&apos;s Office to limit the number of productions allowed in the neighborhood, but were only told &quot;rest periods for streets within neighborhoods [will be] determined on a case-by-case basis.&quot; Well, nap time is over DUMBO, Marky Mark &amp; Co. rolled in this morning! And he&apos;s not here handing out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713014531/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/wahlberg_brothers_plan_to_open_whal.php">Wahlburgers</a> <em>or</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713014531/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eSN8Cwit_s&amp;ob=av3e">Good Vibrations</a>.</p>

<p>The actor is here filming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713014531/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235522/"><em>Broken City</em></a> (playing &quot;an ex-cop trailing the wife of New York City&apos;s mayor finds himself immersed in a larger scandal&quot;), which also stars Russell Crowe and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Allen Hughes (<em>Menace II Society</em>) is directing, and it looks like him and his crew will only be around until tomorrow sometime.</p>

<p>While the shoot may be short, the production is taking up much of the neighborhood (Jay Street from York to Water, Pearl from York to Plymouth, Adams from York to Plymouth, Front from Jay to Main, and Water from Jay to Main). So how are the DUMBO residents taking it? Looks like the 1% is ready to go up against... the 1%. One commenter on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713014531/http://dumbonyc.com/2011/11/03/filming-in-dumbo-broken-city/">DUMBO NYC</a> declares, <strong>&quot;We should occupy the film sites.&quot;</strong> Another echoes that sentiment, saying, &quot;The larger scandal here is that film companies are making money at the expense of the people who live here.&quot;</p>
