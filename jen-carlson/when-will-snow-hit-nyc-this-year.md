<p>The humidity has been lifting, and by next Monday we&apos;re projected to only hit a high of 59 degrees! So when is the snow going to hit, making us pine for the days the subway platform felt like a bikram yoga studio? </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033021/http://www.weather.com/news/weather-winter/snow-seasons-first-average-20121004">Weather.com</a>, the average first date of snowfall in New York City is December 15th (though it&apos;s happened as early October 21st, back in 1952). Here&apos;s the magic formula they used:</p><blockquote>&quot;We&apos;ve plotted National Weather Service 30-year average dates of the season&apos;s first measurable snow, the earliest-in-season snow on record, and average annual snowfall for dozens of cities on the interactive map above... see when, climatologically speaking, is the date by which you&apos;ll typically see the season&apos;s first measurable snow.&quot;</blockquote>It&apos;s unclear if they factored in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033021/http://gothamist.com/tags/globalwarming">dying polar bears</a> to this equation, however.<p></p>

<p>Either way, this gives us <em>plenty of time</em> to think of an alternative to the following phrases, which have worn out their welcome: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033021/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzardgeddon">Blizzardgeddon</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033021/http://gothamist.com/tags/snowpocalypse">Snowpocalypse</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033021/http://gothamist.com/tags/snowtoriousbig">Snowtorious BIG</a> (actually we still kind of like that one).</p>
