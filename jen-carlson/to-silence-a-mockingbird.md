But what happens when <em>nature</em> encroaches upon our sonic space? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702183449/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/06/21/2009-06-21_we_could_kill_a_mockingbird_nyers_not_thrilled_by_bawdy_birds_latenight_trills.html">The Daily News</a> looks into the sex-crazed mockingbirds of NYC, whose mating calls are slowly driving locals insane. The population has gone up 10% in a year, not good news for those who describe the sound outside of their windows as &quot;loud and shrill and grating.&quot; </p>

<p>The male mating calls mimic sounds they hear, so essentially you could be listening to a bird&apos;s interpretation of street noise. One Greenwich Village resident declared, &quot;The bird has an amazing ability to imitate car alarms. He starts every night about 2 a.m.&quot; Skeptical? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702183449/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zd6Iy4JuGk">Watch this video</a> of a mockingbird perfectly imitating a car alarm, over and over again.</p>

<p>And that&apos;s not all: the territorial birds have been known to attack! A professional dog walker from the Bronx told the paper she&apos;s got the fear in her after being attacked by one on 236th Street in Riverdale a year ago. It&apos;s all so Hitchcockian!</p>
