<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922123254/http://gothamist.com/tags/shamrockshake">Shamrock Shake</a> season, and the green stuff is already ready to be slung at your local McDonald&apos;s, and this year <em>all</em> of America will be able to indulge in the seasonal treat. The chain announced today that the shake will go national this year, for the first time in its 42-year-long existence. According to the McDonald&apos;s spokeswoman, Ashlee Yingling, the minty shake &quot;is currently available at every one of McDonald&apos;s 14,000 U.S. restaurants,&quot; and will be available through March 25th. The latest sightings, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922123254/http://shamrockshake.com/shamrock.shake">the Shamrock Shake finder</a> have been in Manhattan, at 23rd Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue, and 49th Street at 3rd Avenue.</p>

<p>Sadly, this year O&apos;Grimacey won&apos;t be the spokesman, Yingling told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922123254/http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/08/news/companies/mcdonalds_shamrock_shake/">CNN</a> he&apos;s been retired&#x2014;&quot;We will not be bringing back Uncle O&apos;Grimacey or the jingle you referenced.&quot; No word on if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922123254/https://twitter.com/#!/McDonalds/status/166929897959342081">Salt-N-Pepa</a> will be taking over the job, but here here&apos;s ol&apos; O&apos;Grimacey, one last time: </p>

<p>Now, prepare for an onslaught of Shamrock Shake content <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922123254/http://instagr.am/p/GwCOtUMT5t/">in your social media outlets</a>. And since we like to guilt-gulp ours, we looked up the nutritional info once again&#x2014;a small Shamrock Shake comes with 540 calories and 16 grams of fat, and a large with 840 calories and 24 grams of fat. So if you&apos;re going to go for it, might as well dunk in some Thin Mints, too&#x2014;it is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922123254/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/21/where_to_find_girl_scout_cookies_th.php">Girl Scout Cookie season</a>, after all.</p>
