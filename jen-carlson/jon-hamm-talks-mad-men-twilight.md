<p>Jon Hamm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170307/http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/13680805">recently discussed</a> the future of <em>Mad Men</em> and who is to <em>really</em> blame for the delay of the next season. Unsurprisingly, it was the fat cats in Hollywood. He says, &quot;it was the network and the studio. When billionaires fight it tends to take a lot longer than when normal people do.&quot; The fifth season will air sometime early next year, and the actor says it will only last two more seasons after that, noting, &quot;I think it should end. Everything should end.&quot; <em>Deep.</em></p>

<p>In the meantime, Hamm discusses his own existence, admitting, &quot;I&apos;m 40, which is ridiculously old in Hollywood. I mean, come on I&apos;m not in <em>Twilight</em>. I could play their grandfather or something.&quot; (Note to Hollywood, please make Jon Hamm a sexy vampire dad.)</p>

<p>As for his part in <em>Mad Men</em>, his character Don Draper will allegedly have &quot;an exciting role&quot; in the upcoming season (when doesn&apos;t he?), and Hamm will be directing the first episode himself, which will happen in July or August... though no one has seen a script yet.</p>
