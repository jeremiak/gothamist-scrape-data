</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s that time of year again, when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140027/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynbotanicgarden">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a> declares one block in the borough the greenest of them all. This morning they&apos;ll officially announce all of the winners at a ceremony, and we&apos;ll have more from there later, but right now we are able to announce that the big winner is Lincoln Road from Bedford Avenue to Rogers Avenue, in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens. </p>

<p>That stretch of city sidewalk is the greenest <em>residential</em> block in Brooklyn, according to the BBG and their voting panel, who chose them out of more than 200 contenders. Click through for a glimpse at their green thumb magic. And note, PGL&apos;s win means the end of Flatbush&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140027/http://gothamist.com/tags/greenestblocks">two year streak</a> in taking home the <strike>gold</strike> green.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more later from the press conference, including winners of the greenest storefront and commercial spaces.</p>
