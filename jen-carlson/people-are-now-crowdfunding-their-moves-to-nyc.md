The world is now your trust fund! You no longer have to work in porn to earn your Big City money <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172051/http://dailyrefill.blogs.com/daily/2004/04/shock_awe_.html">like <em>some of us</em> did</a>.<p></p>

<p>There are thousands of hopeful would-be New Yorkers over there trying to get enough scratch together for a move to the big city, and this week some were featured in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172051/http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/future-new-yorkers-funding-moves-to-city-online-1.6417469">an amNewYork story about their brave struggle</a>. Let&apos;s use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172051/http://www.gofundme.com/NewYorkDreamFund">Jes Ann Nail</a> as our example. The Austinite signed up last September after dreaming of living here since 8th grade&#x2014;&quot;I love the energy. I love all the loud city noises. I love walking in herds of people, going places with different hopes and dreams but sharing the same place and time. I love the Art, the Culture, the buildings, the sights. But most of all I love the idea of me moving there to Live. Be. Create. Love. Dance. Dream. Learn and Grow.&quot;</p>

<p>One assumes the city has now sufficiently crushed Jes&apos;s hopes, dreams, and sometimes even her will to live, and that she&apos;s been too busy working a soul-crushing job to have any time to &quot;create&quot; or &quot;be.&quot; She says the money &quot;is gone. It went very quickly,&quot; but Jes, at least for the press, is keeping optimistic.</p>

<p>She told AmNY that she&apos;s falling back on the &quot;New York survival goals&quot; she posted on her GoFundMe page, namely the part about teaching dance and &quot;showing my art work in galleries, coffee shops.&quot; She&apos;s now booking students through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172051/http://jesannnail.com/">her website</a> &quot;and producing paintings she hopes to sell.&quot; She&apos;s paying half of a $1900/month rent (or a &quot;share&quot; of it, at least, with her boyfriend) and says, &quot;If you&apos;re willing to live in the boroughs, you can make it work.&quot; At least she didn&apos;t expect a life she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172051/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/young_writer_who_moved_to_nyc_finds.php">saw on TV</a>... but if someone sees Jes please tell her they&apos;re <em>all</em> boroughs.</p>
