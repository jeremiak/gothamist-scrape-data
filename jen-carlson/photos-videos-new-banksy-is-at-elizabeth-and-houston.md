So basically, that is confirmation that the new Banksy is at that location. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023309/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/todays_banksy_is_not_getting_announ.php">Earlier today we stopped by</a> and spotted a bumper car, speakers, a stage area, a scythe, and lights.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 5:48 p.m.:</strong> After we spotted him at a nearby bar, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023309/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php">Banksy crew member</a> made his way to the site and stepped behind the tarp.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 6 p.m.:</strong> Word is the unveiling was delayed until 6:30 p.m. There are about 200 people surrounding the site now.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 6:05 p.m.:</strong> Banksy just uploaded this to Instagram. The caption is Bowery but he&apos;s gotten his own location wrong before!:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 6:20 p.m.:</strong> There&apos;s accordion music and smoke coming from behind the tarp. And the tarp is being cut down by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023309/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php#photo-10">Steve Zissou-sky</a>!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 6:29 p.m.:</strong> Banksy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023309/http://banksy.co.uk/2013/10/25/bowery">updated his website</a> with this video, featuring Blue Oyster Cult, and noting it will run &quot;tonight through Sunday, dusk until midnight.&quot;</p>

<p>Scott Lynch tells us: &quot;At least 1000 people, but installation itself is kind of slight. Grim Reaper in a bumper car tootles around to a guy playing accordion, then every five minutes Blue Oyster Cult comes on with disco lights. Reaper spins around. Repeat.&quot; But whatever, it&apos;s FUN!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 7:15 p.m.:</strong> The audio is now up on Banksy&apos;s site, welcoming you to the fair. He says, &quot;This is the dance of death,&quot; and adds that &quot;one of you will die tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>And was this piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023309/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/7639413/Banksy-gives-band-200k-painting-in-apology-for-stealing-their-name.html">based off a painting</a> he gave a band after he accidentally stole their name for the title of his movie, <em>Exit Through the Gift Shop</em>? Seems like it. (h/t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023309/http://hyperallergic.com/90538/banksys-friday-night-surprise-looks-creepy/">Hyperallergic</a>)</p>

<p>Some believe this man walking in to the gated off area today (and then seen briefly directing things inside) is Banksy. This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023309/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php#photo-11">the same man</a> who was spotted during Ronald McDonald&apos;s trial run, and taking photographs at the Woodside piece. But LA LA LA we don&apos;t really want him unmasked, do we?</p>
