<p>While Dominique Ansel has trademarked the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015606/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">Cronut</a>&#x2122;, he cannot stop people from making their own cronut-like pastries, slapping a $5 pricetag on them, and calling them something else. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015606/http://www.millefeuille-nyc.com/">Mille-Feuille Bakery</a> (located near Washington Square Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015606/https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Dominique+Ansel+Bakery,+Spring+Street,+New+York,+NY&amp;daddr=Mille-feuille+Bakery+Cafe,+552+LaGuardia+Place,+New+York,+NY+10012&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.726839,-74.000544&amp;sspn=0.006228,0.012059&amp;geocode=FaJqbQId582W-yGa8-JAAhofUCk_Qo5ajFnCiTGa8-JAAhofUA%3BFX16bQIdqeCW-ylPOKO2kVnCiTGY54cYiok-aA&amp;oq=dominique+an&amp;t=h&amp;gl=us&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ltm&amp;z=17"><em>just blocks</em></a> from Ansel himself) isn&apos;t the first, and they&apos;re certainly not the last to do this... but they are and always will be the first place the Gothamist staff ever tasted a cronut-esque thing. We tried their Vanilla Bean and Raspberry &quot;french donuts&quot; this afternoon&#x2014;unsurprisingly, they were really quite good. Here are some staff reactions on the French Donut, and veering off topic, the Cronut Craze in general:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;It tasted like the overwrought decadence of a dying materialist culture&#x2014;I think this is the taste Gatsby had in his mouth in the pool. Also very greasy.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015606/https://twitter.com/Jakedobkin">Jake Dobkin</a>
</li><li>&quot;To people who haven&apos;t eaten a Cronut&#x2122; yet (and I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s most of this place&apos;s market) this fauxnut is like the Shr&#xF6;dinger&apos;s Cat of pastries. You don&apos;t know if it&apos;s nothing like a cronut, or an exact replica. Only until you open the box (wait in line for 15 hours) will you know for sure. It&apos;s essentially a tasty jelly donut and I appreciate the flakiness of the pastry, but I also think $5 is a cruel price to pay for an imitation.&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015606/https://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a>
</li><li>&quot;Tastes like a jelly donut. Totally unsure what the fuss is all about.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015606/https://twitter.com/JJSteele3">Josh Steele</a>
</li><li>&quot;Like the best funnel cake at the county fair and a jelly donut had a baby in my mouth.&quot; &#x2014; Allison Davis</li></ul>

<p>We tracked down <em>two</em> dedicated pastry connoisseurs who have managed to try BOTH the Cronut&#x2122; and this fauxnut, and we were told that the main thing that sets the two apart is that the original Cronut&#x2122; is flakier and crispier, whereas the fauxnut is greasier and chewier. And both are delicious, in the way that both croissants and doughnuts are enjoyable things to eat sometimes. But note: Neither are worth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015606/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/25/photo_people_sleeping_on_street_to.php">pressing your bare skin to the dirty New York City sidewalk</a> for.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Olivier at Mille-Feuille would like to point out that French Donuts (and Cronuts, too) have a shelf life, and should be eaten right away. We waited a few hours before eating ours&#x2014;but we devoured them none-the-less.</p>
