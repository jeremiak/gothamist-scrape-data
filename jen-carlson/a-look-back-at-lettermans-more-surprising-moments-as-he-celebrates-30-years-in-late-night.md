</div></div>					<p>Tomorrow night will mark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529220546/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidletterman">David Letterman</a>&apos;s 30th year anniversary in late night television, though not always with the same network. He started out as the host of NBC&apos;s <em>Late Night With David Letterman</em> on February 1st, 1982, and left a little over a decade when he made his shift over to CBS in 1993. According to the <em>Late Show</em>&apos;s executive producer Rob Burnett, the milestone may be mentioned on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529220546/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/television/david-letterman-howard-stern-board-marks-30-years-transforming-late-night-comedy-article-1.1013175#ixzz1l2x2iJaN">tomorrow night&apos;s show</a>, &quot;but I don&#x2019;t see an extravaganza coming to fruition. Dave has never been super comfortable drawing a lot of attention to himself.&quot; Howard Stern is a guest on the show tomorrow night, who Burnett refers to as &quot;a kindred spirit with Dave.&quot;</p>

<p>So if Letterman isn&apos;t going to promise an anniversary special complete with a retrospective on his long career, the least we can do is take a look back ourselves. Here are some more of the unexpected moments, like the time Jerry Garcia and Dave did a little duet, or when Hunter S. Thompson paid the host a visit. Or, you know, that time Letterman did a whole &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529220546/http://www.life.com/gallery/24102/david-letterman-as-an-80s-bachelor">1980s bachelor</a>&quot; photo shoot at his home in Westchester for photographer Susan Wood.
