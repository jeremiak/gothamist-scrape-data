Recently she delivered some anecdotal gold to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402115336/http://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2011/03/qa_with_countess_luann_delesseps_one_of_the_real_housewives_of_new_york">the Brick Underground</a>; for the most part she discusses New York City real estate (she&apos;d love to move into Gracie Mansion and give it a fresh coat of paint!), and then... she talks about that time six years ago she was nearly forced to ride the subway with the commoners. Oh what an adventure she had!</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Coming back from the Bronx Zoo with my two children in 2005.  We took the bus up Madison Avenue, but we missed the bus coming back. So, we decided to take the subway. The kids were a little scared, since there were some pretty shifty characters on that subway. But it was an experience they will never forget.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Yes kids, Never Forget 2005, that time you took the subway.</p>
