Paul Lawrence was recently fined $2,000 for picking up an air conditioner on a sidewalk in Middle Village, Queens&#x2014;turns out that even though he was told he could take it from a woman at the building, the item was officially city property once it was set on the ground. <p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429095919/http://wcbstv.com/local/recycling.fine.discarded.2.1800611.html">WCBS</a>, a sanitation officer watched from a distance as he picked the air conditioner up from the curb and put it in his car. He then fined him $2,000, impounded his car, <em>and</em> fined his 73-year-old aunt $2,000 since she is the owner of the car! Department of Sanitation officials clarified that it&apos;s not <em>always</em> illegal to pick up something from the street, it&apos;s only when a vehicle is involved. The law was &quot;designed to deter organized rings of recycling thefts&quot; that end up costing the city hundreds of thousands a year since recycling is a revenue source.</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg commented on the incident, telling WCBS, &quot;Two thousand dollars is a pretty hefty fine and I don&apos;t know what law was broken.&quot;</p>
