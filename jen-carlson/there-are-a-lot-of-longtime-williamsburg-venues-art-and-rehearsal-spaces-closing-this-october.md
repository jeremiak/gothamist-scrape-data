Rumors have been flying around recently that Williamsburg&apos;s Monster Island would be demolished and reincarnated as a Whole Foods, and while there&apos;s no proof in the grocer taking over the space, it will be coming down this year. <p></p>

<p>Later this year Monster Island, Secret Project Robot, Mollusk Surf Shop, and a number of Todd P rehearsal spaces that have been in the neighborhood for quite some time, will all be evicted. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409002125/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101807596/monster-island-arts-and-music-festival-farewell-pa">their Kickstarter campaign</a>, their expiration date is in October, with demolition beginning in November. The group involved in the spaces writes: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Over the last 7 years we have always thrown an annual Block Party where we invite the entire neighborhood in to listen to live bands on the street, tour the building and host 2 giant art installations; as that this is our last block party ever (the building is slated for demolition in November), we&apos;d like your help.

<p>This year&apos;s block party will entail over 12 live music performances from building bands... It will host 2 art installations... It will also host open studios, an all day BBQ, DJ&apos;s, a video installation in the basement and live music in several practice spaces.  We plan to make a memorabilia T-Shirt, poster and tote bag of Monster Island so that our community will have something tangible to remember us by.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>We&apos;ll have more on this story later this week, as it becomes more clear what is happening to the empty space the demolition will leave behind.</p>
