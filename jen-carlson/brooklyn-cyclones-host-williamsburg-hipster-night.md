<p>The Brooklyn Cyclones are inviting Williamsburg&apos;s bearded and skinny jean-ed set to Coney Island for their own special night at the ballgame, dubbed Williamsburg Night. This is going down on July 5th, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606121149/http://brooklyncyclones.com.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/PDFs/Williamburg%20Night.pdf">their flyer</a> notes that any bearded fans receive special vouchers, and those wearing skinny jeans can run the bases after the game.</p>

<p>Plus, since hipsters love Skeeball more than baseball (probably?) there&apos;s going to be a Skeeball tournament run by Williamsburg&apos;s own Full Circle Bar. To make the people of Williamsburg feel even more comforted in the strange new land of Coney Island, they will be surrounded by &quot;some as-yet-unidentified Williamsburg music and art.&#x201D; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606121149/http://brokelyn.com/brooklyn-cyclones-wliiamsburg-night/">Brokelyn</a>]</p>
