The campaign just launched yesterday, and aims to help bring the musical&#x2014;based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis&#x2014;to the stage. While the initial run will be at London&apos;s Almeida Theatre later this year, Jesse Singer&#x2014;who is producing it&#x2014;told us today that they are in talks about when and where to bring it over to New York, so that <em>will happen</em> (and the funds from this Kickstarter&#x2014;if wildly successful&#x2014;will go towards that as well). </p>

<p>This is the fundraising platform&apos;s highest profile Musical Theater project to date, and Singer explained, &quot;We chose Kickstarter because of its ability to to generate excitement and build a new community around our production. There is already an expansive and dedicated fan base... we really built this campaign with these fans in mind.&quot; With that, the rewards are better than the thickest paper stock in all the land (including Patrick Bateman business cards, yoga with Duncan Sheik, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160502131732/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798121016/american-psycho">etc</a>!)</p>

<p>Below, check out the Kickstarter video, which features all of the major players (including Ellis), as well as the first listen to one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160502131732/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/duncan_sheik_american_psycho_musical.php">the song&apos;s Sheik created</a> for the musical:<br>
