                            <p>New Yorkers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083435/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/28/flashback_hating_on_suburbia.php">long hated on Suburbia</a>, but that doesn&apos;t mean we don&apos;t long to integrate some of its more charming qualities into our urban landscape. Like lawns. Lush, green, glorious lawns. </p>

<p>Architectural designer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208083435/http://www.aaron-berman.com/">Aaron Berman</a> sent us over his renderings for a Mobile Suburbia, which features a &quot;sliding lawn&quot; that would hang high in the air above the bustling sidewalks, as your own private sanctuary of solitude. It wouldn&apos;t be yours <em>forever</em>, because nothing really is, but you would be able to rent it for a little &quot;serenity now&quot; session. Or Ros&#xE9; kegger. Berman tells us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Mobile Suburbia is a mobile service that aims to bring the &apos;pleasures&apos; of suburban life to an urban context, specifically New York City. The mobile service takes the form of a prosthetic facade adaptor kit that New Yorkers can rent in order to temporarily enjoy an &apos;urban suburbia.&apos; This proposal opportunistically uses mobility as an enabler of shared infrastructure and space. With the ability to be deployed daily to different residential locations throughout New York City, the concept of a private, &apos;suburban back yard&apos; becomes a reality for the urban dweller. After all, most suburban yards are only used for a few hours a week &#x2014; why pay extra for a balcony or roof deck when you can just rent private outdoor space as needed?

<p>My inspiration for Mobile Suburbia came from research I did about &apos;Mobile Architecture and Mobile Services&apos; while attending Columbia University&apos;s Graduate School of Architecture.  I wanted to design a mobile service for NYC (The land of Mobile Services) that didn&apos;t previously exist. I think there could be a few variations of the design, each of which would be modified to fit specific building typologies.  One for the glass skyscraper, one for the townhouse/brownstone, etc.  For some buildings it could be something as simple as an expanding lawn that can be installed into your existing fire escape, for example.&quot;</p></blockquote>It looks a little precarious, but you&apos;re probably in more danger when you spend those evenings alone on your century old fire escape romanticizing the flickering lights and hot white noise of the city while reading <em>The Bell Jar</em>.<p></p>
