</div></div>					<p>Maybe the real reason New Yorkers don&apos;t look up is because they know they&apos;ll see a goddamn mansion on top of a building. A sprawling set of cottages, even. Their dream, completely out of reach, looking down on them, cackling. </p>

<p>Over at the corner of East 13th Street and 3rd Avenue is the most real estate envy inducing property we&apos;ve ever seen in this town: a $4.4 million penthouse with a rooftop cottage. Or maybe it&apos;s <em>cottages</em>&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135840/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3467444">the Corcoran listing</a>, there are more than one, and there are two private garden terraces to go with them. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="evcottageenvy15.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135840im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/evcottageenvy15.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>You know, we&apos;ve tried to embrace the beauty of living in a tiny studio overlooking a garbage courtyard, to really live that minimalist lifestyle, to be at one with our closet that is half the depth of a normal closet, therefore not allowing for regular size hangers. We know these grand living spaces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135840/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/17/demi_moore_is_selling_her_central_p.php">mean nothing in the end</a>. But we want this. We want the Manhattan rooftop cottage life. Please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135840/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tell us</a> who we sell our souls to in order to make this happen. [Thanks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135840/http://evgrieve.com/2015/06/live-in-tranquil-cottages-overlooking.html">EV Grieve</a>. Thanks a lot.]</p>
