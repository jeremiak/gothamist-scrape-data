<p>Recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161904/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">Justin Bieber</a> urinated into a mop bucket housed in the basement of a New York City restaurant because egomaniacal teenage pop stars mixed with alcohol is The Devil&apos;s Cocktail. While the video that his &quot;friend&quot; filmed showing the incident mostly features Bieber&apos;s back, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161904/http://www.tmz.com/2013/07/10/justin-bieber-restaurant-mop-bucket-piss-pee-urinate-video-bill-clinton/">TMZ</a> seems pretty confident this is him, saying they were &quot;told Bieber and his idiotic friends were leaving some nightclub, exiting through a restaurant kitchen, and Bieber decided he needed to take a leak. But rather than go to a bathroom like a civilized person, Bieber whipped out his junk and whizzed into a yellow mop bucket used to clean the restaurant&apos;s floors.&quot; His hype men cheered on, &quot;That&apos;s the coolest spot to piss.&quot;</p>

<p>So, let&apos;s try to unfurl the mystery of what floors have now been mopped with Bieber Pee. Some clues:</p><ul><li>It&apos;s definitely in Manhattan, because LOL to Bieber going out in any other borough.<br>
</li><li>After doing the deed, he yells at a photo: &quot;Fuck Bill Clinton!&quot; So, this place has a photo of Bill Clinton hanging inside. <br>
</li><li>It&apos;s described as both a nightclub and a restaurant in TMZ&apos;s post, but it looks more like the latter. So this is likely a restaurant/bar that stays open late.<br>
</li><li>The floor tiling is black and white, with some tiles forming flower-esque patterns.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Now see it all for yourself:</p>
