<p>The fourth trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161324/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>Dark Knight Rises</em></a> movie has been released, with some new footage from the final piece of Christopher Nolan&apos;s trilogy. Previously we&apos;ve seen the East River bridges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161324/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/01/watch_the_new_dark_knight_rises_tra.php">getting blown up</a> and the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161324/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/video_the_latest_dark_knight_rises.php">falling apart</a>&#x2014;so naturally, Batman is coming out of retirement, and he&apos;s pretty pissed off. But we&apos;ll take angry Batman over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161324/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/batman_looks_super_bummed_hawking_m.php">Sad Batman</a> any day.</p>

<p>The summer blockbuster hits the big screen on July 20th (but good luck getting tickets), with AMC theaters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161324/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/05/dark_knight_marathon.php">running a marathon</a> up until the first midnight screening.</p>
