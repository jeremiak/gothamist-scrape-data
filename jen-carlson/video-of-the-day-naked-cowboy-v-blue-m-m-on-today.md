title: Video of the Day: Naked Cowboy v. Blue M&M; on Today
---

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014945/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/23/naked_cowboys_lawsuit_against_mms_c.php">Following the announcement</a> that a judge will allow some of Naked Cowboy&apos;s lawsuit against Mars Inc. to move forward, the tighty-whitey bearing Robert Burck appeared on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014945/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/25363382">the Today Show</a> this morning. </p>

<center><iframe height="339" width="425" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014945if_/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22425001/vp/25363451#25363451" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></center>

<p>The 38-year-old entertainer is hoping to make some extra coin in the case, but Mars says they had a right to parody and are protected under the First Amendment. Amongst many, many other things, Burck noted: &#x201C;I came to New York City to be the most celebrated entertainer of all time. There are certain values that are representative of that effort &#x2014; eating candy is not one of them. When they dressed up the M&amp;M; to personify the Naked Cowboy, they implied that I was endorsing their product. <strong>Type II diabetes and childhood obesity is epidemic. I am the opposite of that. I don&#x2019;t endorse that product.</strong>&#x201D; </p>

<p>NBC&apos;s Dan Abrams thinks Burck has a shot to win the case, saying, &quot;after all, that blue M&amp;M; does have a pair of underwear on, a cowboy hat and a guitar.&quot; But now that we all know the Cowboy doubles up on the underwear, the big question is: was the blue M&amp;M; sporting a 2-ply as well?</p>
