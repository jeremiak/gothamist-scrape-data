It&apos;s the end of an era&#x2014;one long-time member, Skye Ferrante, was recently told his 1929 black Royal typewriter (with glass keys) was no longer welcome.<p></p>

<p>The 37-year-old returned to the special room devoted to typists after an 8-month break, and where there was once a sign that read &quot;In the event that there are no desks available, laptop users must make room for typists,&quot; he quickly found out his kind was no longer going to be accommodated for. The executive director told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507212307/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/20/2010-05-20_untitled__typewriter20m.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;No one wants to work around the clacking of a typewriter.&quot;</p>

<p>Ferrante says he was told he was &quot;the unintended beneficiary of a policy to placate the elderly members who have all since died off. They offered me a choice to switch to a laptop or refund my money, which to me is no choice at all.&quot;</p>

<p>While he is allowed to use the space until the end of his term on June 30th, he says he won&apos;t return.</p>
