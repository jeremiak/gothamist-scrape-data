<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033602/http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/the-worlds-ugliest-buildings/1/?label=the-worlds-ugliest-building">Travel + Leisure</a> takes a look at the World&apos;s Ugliest Buildings, and somehow no New York structures made the list. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033602/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/18/verizon.php">Not even the Verizon Building</a>. Though the <em>New York</em> magazine architecture critic may have an explanation; he tells them: &#x201C;The ugliest buildings are the anonymous ones. Even if an experimental, high-profile building doesn&#x2019;t quite deliver, at least the architect is trying something. A boring building is a warehouse in the middle of New Jersey.&#x201D; </p>

<p>So which New York buildings would you add to their list? Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033602/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/01/gothamists_pick.php">our picks</a> from a few years ago (for shame, the Verizon Building didn&apos;t make it to that list either!).</p>
