Before filming a recent episode the faux-news anchor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313151724/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070727/ap_en_ot/people_stephen_colbert;_ylt=Anz0c1kcD.HE5f9wH1v_QS5xFb8C">broke his left wrist</a> while running around the studio of The Colbert Report to pump up the audience before taping. He really does hate the left!</p>

<p>This past week, he removed a giant foam hand to reveal the cast, saying &quot;I didn&apos;t want to draw attention to it. I didn&apos;t want to play on your sympathy...owww!!&quot; We wonder if &quot;floors&quot; will replace &quot;bears&quot; on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313151724/http://www.threatdowngenerator.com/">his Threat Down list</a>. And Colbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313151724/http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/player.jhtml?ml_video=90524&amp;ml_collection=&amp;ml_gateway=&amp;ml_gateway_id=&amp;ml_comedian=&amp;ml_runtime=&amp;ml_context=show&amp;ml_origin_url=%2F&amp;ml_playlist=&amp;lnk=&amp;is_large=true">also footage of him wiping out</a>, with Beyonce Knowles&apos; &quot;Ring the Alarm&quot; playing - a nod to the singer&apos;s own fall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120313151724/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1565743/20070727/knowles_beyonce.jhtml">last week</a>.</p>

<p>And yesterday, Colbert got presidential press secretary Tony Snow to sign his cast as they filmed a mock press conference.  The cast will be auctioned off to raise money for military families.</p>
