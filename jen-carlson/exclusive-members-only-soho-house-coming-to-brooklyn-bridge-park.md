					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415182440/http://gothamist.com/tags/sohohouse">Soho House</a> is bringing its name brand, members-only adult playhouse to Brooklyn Bridge Park. This time around, their third in NYC, they will rename the outpost&#x2014;it will be called the Dumbo House. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415182440/http://www.sohohouse.com/">The club</a>, which potential members must apply to become a part of and then pay a hefty annual fee thereafter, will be housed inside of Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s Empire Stores. </p>

<p>Community news website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415182440/http://brooklynbridgeparents.com/soho-house-dumbo-coming-this-fall">Brooklyn Bridge Parents</a> reports that it will take over the top two floors of the Empire Stores, above <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415182440/http://brooklynbridgeparents.com/soho-house-is-opening-italian-eatery-at-the-empire-stores-in-dumbo/">Cecconi&#x2019;s Restaurant</a>&#x2014;it &quot;will include an outside terrace with views of the East River and the Statue of Liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2015, we reported that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415182440/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/25/empire_stores_restaurants.php">a pizzeria run by Soho House</a> would be coming to Empire Stores.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415182440/http://gothamist.com/tags/empirestores">Empire Stores</a>, a Civil War-era building that has been undergoing renovations for the past few years, will likely be complete later this year (currently West Elm, housed on the ground floor, is open). According to an email that went out to Soho House members, per the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415182440/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/40/15/dtg-soho-house-opening-in-dumbo-2017-04-14-bk.html">Brooklyn Paper</a>, Dumbo House will open in Fall 2017. </p>

<p>Soho House currently has two other outposts in New York, in the Meatpacking District and on the Lower East Side. Membership runs from $1,050/year (if you are under 27 and only belong to your local house), to $3,200/year (if you are over 27 and have access to every Soho House). </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Empire Stores and a rep for Soho House for more details and will update when we hear back. Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation is not commenting at this time.</p>
