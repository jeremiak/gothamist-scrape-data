<p>Halloween is for <em>everyone</em>, but the candy isn&apos;t always. Have no fear, sweet-toothed vegans ,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104151807/http://girliegirlarmy.com/blog/20111029/oh-hell-yea-halloween-candy-done-right/">The GirlieGirl Army</a> is alerting their readers to a trick or treat option this season that will help fatten you up with the rest of America. They note that &quot;the Mars candy company not only tests on animals, but allegedly has child slaves make their candy,&quot; before offering their alternative: Go Max Go bars. The cruelty-free line of candy bars are &quot;all-natural, dairy-free, and vegan versions of the old-timey favorites, and as delicious.&quot; They&apos;ve got your nougat, your caramel, your coconut... whatever the inner non-vegan inside of you is craving. (Order online or go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104151807/http://www.gomaxgofoods.com/where.htm">one of the NYC locations</a> that sells them.)</p>

Including Blow Pops, Starburst jelly beans, Laffy Taffy, Lemonheads, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104151807/http://girliegirlarmy.com/blog/20091016/trick-or-treat-cruelty-free-candy/">so much more</a>!</p>
