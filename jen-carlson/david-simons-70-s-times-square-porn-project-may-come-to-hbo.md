<p>As Baz Luhrmann prepares <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201529/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/05/baz_luhrmann_netflix.php">his 1970s South Bronx show</a> for Netflix, David Simon will head to Midtown, for an HBO show focusing on 1970s Times Square.</p>

<p>While the deal isn&apos;t final yet, if it moves forward we&apos;ll be getting a show specifically about the porn industry, titled <em>The Deuce</em>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201529/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/david-simon-reveals-plans-1970s-803073">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, it &quot;will chronicle the legalization and subsequent rise of the porn industry in New York&#x2019;s Times Square from the early 1970s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006201529/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/20/times_square_80s_video.php">through the mid-1980s</a>. Also explored: the rough-and-tumble world that existed in midtown Manhattan until the rise of HIV, the violence of the cocaine epidemic and a rejuvenated real estate market ended the bawdy turbulence.&quot;</p>

<p>Simon has teamed up with  George Pelecanos for the project, and says it started when they heard of &quot;a man who had been one of the mob fronts on 42nd Street during that era,&quot; and had some stories to share. This eventually led to heavy research, and the idea to focus on the porn industry... but don&apos;t expect much of a peep show. He says, &quot;You really have to land it in such a way where it&#x2019;s a story about people... about the moment where something became legal and profitable and what happens to people in that environment when markets prevail.&quot;</p>
