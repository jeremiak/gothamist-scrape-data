By the time we get to a computer, we&apos;ve already forgotten about it. Not today though! Today we actually went in and poked around (you can buy directly from their storefront, as well as get things delivered). We grabbed a flyer on the way out, and clicked around their website to find the &quot;shop by acitivity&quot; section. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081523/http://www.maxdelivery.com/nkz/exec/Category/Display?categoryId=2027">Here</a> you can see what is listed in the package titled &quot;Date Night&quot;. K-Y lubricant! Condoms! Condom cases! Clearly, MaxDelivery thinks we&apos;re easy. And, who are we to argue, they probably picked the right city. Maybe with this kind of attitude the service will last longer than its predecessors: Kozmo and UrbanFetch (which lives on in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081523/http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/show_exhibit/urbanfetch">Museum of E-Failure</a>). </p>
