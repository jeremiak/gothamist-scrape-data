<p>If you see something douchey, say something douchey! For those of you who don&apos;t know about every website ever (because you have lives or something), please enjoy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142810/http://www.subwaydouchery.com/">Subway Douchery</a>, which went live five months ago&#x2014;a century in web time&#x2014;but is new to us, anyway. It posts photos of New Yorkers doing all sorts of douchey things in the subway system. Match it with some clever commentary and it&apos;s ripe for a book deal! The latest posterboy of douchey dealings is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142810/http://www.subwaydouchery.com/post/321887022/subway-douchery-planters-nuts-take-a-cab"><em>this guy</em></a> who decided to lug a giant plant (tree?) on the subway instead of taking a cab. To his credit, didn&apos;t look like he did this during rush hour.</p>

<p>What&apos;s the douchiest thing you&apos;ve ever seen (or done) underground?</p>
