<p>Finally, the most amazing subway busker ever, dressed as Jason and singing Natalie Imbruglia&apos;s &quot;Torn&quot;:</p>

<p><em>Correction: It has been pointed out to us that Imbruglia <em>covered</em> &quot;Torn&quot;&#x2014;it was originally by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314204333/http://bit.ly/2pQfFX">EdnaSwap</a>.</em></p>
