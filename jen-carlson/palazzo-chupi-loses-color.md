Julian Schnabel&apos;s Palazzo Chupi is losing its color! It seems like just yesterday it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144938/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/04/palazzo_chupi.php">generating rainbows</a>, but now the site reports, &quot;Its skin is peeling and it looks like there are some deep gashes over its eyes. It&apos;s also screaming out in pain, but in a high-pitched frequency only our ears are attuned to. Permits just posted on the Department of Buildings website mention the scaffold erection and sidewalk shed, but the extent of Chupi&apos;s care is unclear.&quot;</p>
