<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015349/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/14/its_national_etiquette_week.php">National Etiquette Week</a> again, so from now through the 19th try to not be rude, disgusting, inconsiderate, or in such a goddamn hurry. Relax, breathe, and maybe smile at the other human beings near you. Just for a week! After that you can go back to clipping your nails into someone&apos;s spaghetti on the subway and walking in the bike lane with your giant golf umbrella while texting.</p>

<p>We&apos;ll be tackling etiquette of all sorts every day this week&#x2014;but for now, if <em>you</em> have any photos or video of your fellow New Yorkers and New York City tourists breaking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015349/http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette">the rules of etiquette</a>, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015349/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send them our way</a> and we&apos;ll be happy to shame them... but like, for the greater good.</p>
