<p>Some heartbreaking, but not all that surprising news: the St. Marks record shop Sounds (the one you used to always sell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093221/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sounds-new-york?select=CcTBInqQS38CZz-gBfIowg#CcTBInqQS38CZz-gBfIowg">your used CDs</a> to in order to make some extra scratch) is closing. The news comes in a larger article about the changing streetscape of St. Marks from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093221/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303650204579377163727216956">Wall Street Journal</a>, where they report: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sounds, the last of once-many record shops on the strip, recently limited its business days to Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, said Felicia De Chabris, an associate broker with Halstead Property. She said Sounds&apos; space went on the rental market this month, with its first showings this week.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The stretch used to be home to record shops Joe&apos;s CDs, 13 CDs, Venus Records, Mondo Kim&apos;s, Smash, and Norman&apos;s, Rockit Scientist Records, notes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093221/http://evgrieve.com/2014/02/soon-there-wont-be-any-record-stores-on.html#.Uv41yC9Evu4.twitter">EV Grieve</a>. (At this point, it&apos;s actually easier to list off the names of record stores that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093221/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/record_store_opening_in_brooklyn.php">are still open</a>, rather than closed.) At least all of old St. Marks has changed&#x2014;we still have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502093221/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/fashion/trash-and-vaudeville-still-selling-punks-look-after-38-years.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">Trash and Vaudeville</a>, and the delightfully unchanging hair of Jimmy Webb.</p>
