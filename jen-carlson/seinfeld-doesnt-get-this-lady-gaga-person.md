										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="gagaseinfeld.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030101im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gagaseinfeld.jpg" width="350" height="172" class="image-right"> </span>What is <em>the deal</em> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030101/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a>? That&apos;s what Jerry Seinfeld wants to know. On June 10th the pop star donned a bra and panties at Citi Field and acted belligerent when photographers turned their cameras on her. Her tantrum landed her in Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s suite, where she was separated from the much more civil commoners in the stands. </p>

<p>The Mets camp later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030101/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/11/gaga_makes_no_apologies_mets_apolog.php">apologized</a> to Seinfeld for this move, and now the comedian is making his opinion of the Lady known. He told WFAN radio (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030101/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jerry_seinfeld_calls_calls_lady_1bVWKP67rYxAPhn3qEbGvI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz0rcM8HDCH">the Post</a>): </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;This woman is a jerk. I hate her. I can&#x2019;t believe they put her in my box, which I paid for. 

<p>You give people the finger and you get upgraded? Is that the world we&#x2019;re living in now?</p>

<p>I don&apos;t know what these young people think or how they promote their careers. I wish her the best,&quot; but then added, &quot;you take one &apos;A&apos; off of that and you&apos;ve got gag.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Upon finding out Gaga showed up at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030101/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/21/gaga_not_banned_from_ballparks_perf.php">Yankees game</a> last weekend, he declared: &quot;Oh please, wake me when it&apos;s over.&quot; Maybe he just needs to read the star&apos;s recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102030101/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/119071">Rolling Stone</a> tell-all, where she explains, &quot;When I wake up in the morning, I feel just like any other insecure 24-year-old girl. Then I say, &apos;Bitch, you&apos;re Lady Gaga, you get up and walk the walk today.&apos;&quot; Or maybe Gaga should be punished with a stint on <em>The Marriage Ref</em>.</p>
