<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152444/http://www.paleycenter.org/paleyfest2011-glee">LA&apos;s PaleyFest</a> was all about <em>Glee</em>, and rumor has it the show will dedicate a full episode to Fleetwood Mac&apos;s <em>Rumours</em>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152444/http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/glee-news-gwyneth-paltrow-to-return-next-season-show-will-do-album-episode/">Deadline</a>, &quot;the show&#x2019;s creators had long wanted to do an episode devoted to an album as opposed to an artist.&quot; Anytime someone pays homage to this album, it&apos;s reason to celebrate&#x2014;so it&apos;s lucky for the show&apos;s creators that this news softens the blow of their other announcement: Gwyneth Paltrow will return to the show for <em>at least</em> one more episode.</p>

<p>The Gleewood Mac episode announcement (which must have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152444/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEr1jK45F0A">this girl</a> pretty psyched) does leave us with some questions, though: Will the episode feature &quot;Silver Springs,&quot; originally intended for <em>Rumours</em> but eventually banished as a B-side of &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;? (Take a moment and enjoy, below). And can these kids do justice to the voices of both Stevie Nicks <em>and</em> Lindsey Buckingham?!</p>

<p>While we may not have gotten the big names at our own Paley Center here in New York, there&apos;s still some events left in their Spring Series, which you can check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152444/http://www.paleycenter.org/new-york-series-spring-2011">here</a>.</p>
