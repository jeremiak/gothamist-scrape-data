                            <p>Helicopters buzzed over Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO this morning as police responded to reports of a person rappelling from the Brooklyn Bridge via a rope. Cops told us that they are currently &quot;actively looking for evidence of that or the person,&quot; who was spotted just around 9 a.m. As you can see in the photos above, the rope is still hanging from the bridge.</p>

<p>No arrests have been made yet, but police are questioning witnesses from the neighborhood. We&apos;ll update as we learn more information. </p>

<p>Yesterday morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031020/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/heres_why_the_brooklyn_bridge_was_s.php">an SUV burst into flames</a> on the Brooklyn Bridge, shutting down all eastbound lanes for nearly two hours. Of course, sometimes all it takes is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031020/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/brooklyn_bridge_shut_down_for_2_hou.php">an abandoned car to shut down the bridge.</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Two witnesses who live at 7 Old Fulton said they were doing yoga on their roof when they saw a man rappelling from the bridge; they subsequently took two videos of it, which they gave to police. A man on the scene who saw one of the videos said it shows the suspect climbing the rope. </p>

<p>The rope appears to have been made from this material on the bridge:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The person who rappelled is said to have actually used the rope made from netting first, and then used the red hose, to the left of the rope in this photo. It has now been pulled up by the NYPD.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031020/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cops_hunt_man_who_repelled_down_Qpw0OuSiLPXHzmi980UwNM">told the Post</a> that the man first tried to climb down some netting, but it was too short to make it to the rooftop below. &#x201C;I guess he couldn&apos;t make it [with the netting] so he went back up and came back down with a hose,&#x201D; said witness Richie Torres. &quot;I thought it was one of the guys that work there, but then I realized it&#x2019;s 4th of July today. No guys up there working.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Cops say the suspect is described as a man in his 20s, approximately 5-foot-8 and weighing around 150 pounds. He was last seen wearing a red shirt and glasses. The Post adds that if he&apos;s caught, he is expected to be charged with criminal trespassing.</p>
