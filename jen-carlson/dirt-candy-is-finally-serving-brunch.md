</div></div>					<p>Last week Amanda Cohen announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021061706/https://instagram.com/p/67ys-oRaJT/">via Instagram</a> that her restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021061706/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/02/dirt_candy_20.php">Dirt Candy</a> would start serving brunch (while also revealing she had reservations about doing so). In the end, she caved to the NYC brunch crowd, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021061706/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2015/09/cant-beet-this-dirt-candy-finally-adds-brunch/">telling B+B</a> that it&apos;s &#x201C;just silly to have a place in New York not open on a Saturday and Sunday, during one of the most popular meals.&#x201D;</p>

<p>While brunch service soft-opened last weekend, it won&apos;t officially begin until September 12th (11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays). However, they announced another pre-launch preview weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021061706/https://www.facebook.com/DirtCandyNYC/photos/a.114939540923.101301.57295990923/10153097455730924/?type=1">on Facebook</a>: &quot;Labor Day Weekend?!? That means you can come to brunch! We&apos;re still secret, we still haven&apos;t announced it to the press, and we&apos;ll still stuff you full of smoked beet sandwiches and get you drunk!&quot; There are no reservations, and Dirt Candy is insanely popular, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021061706/https://instagram.com/p/6-NhtLxaD-/?taken-by=dirtcandynyc">get there early</a>. </p>

<p>Click through for a preview of Cohen&apos;s creative brunch dishes, which include fennel walnut stick buns, beet coffee cake, chocolate and onion fritters, tomato biscuits with basil butter and green tomato jam, a smoked beet sandwich, and a spinach ramen salad.</p>

<p><em>Dirt Candy is located at 86 Allen Street, btwn Broome and Grand</em></p>
