<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205643/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">High Line</a> claims it got their 2 millionth visitor on Thursday, since opening to the public <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205643/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/08/ribbon_officially_cut_at_the_high_l.php">last June</a>. In some sort of made-up ceremony, they dubbed Zach and Lexi Hauser (a brother, 12, and sister, 9) from North Carolina the co-2 millionth visitor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521205643/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/high_achiever_e7WqofvTNnoVtnzZX5FK1J">The Post</a> notes that workers have been counting visitors daily, and a Parks spokeswoman explained, &quot;They were a representation of 2 million. It was not necessarily exact. It was an informed estimate.&quot; </p>

<p>What do the winners of the title get? They&apos;ll be participating in a tree-planting ceremony <em>and</em> they&apos;ll get a plaque! Zach says, &quot;This park is really cool. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it.&quot; Sister Lexi noted that purple is her favorite color.</p>
