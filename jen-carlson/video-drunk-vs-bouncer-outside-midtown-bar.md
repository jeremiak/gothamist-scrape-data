title: Video: Drunk Vs. Bouncer Outside Midtown Bar
---

	
										<p>Sometime last week the universe orchestrated this piece of sidewalk theater, starring a drunk kid, a bouncer, and a bystander with the ability to record live, moving, action! Seems the young man wanted to get in to <strike>Clancy&apos;s</strike> Irish Exit on 2nd Avenue, and when denied by the bouncer he verbally assaulted him. With each &quot;fuck you!&quot; aggressively screamed into his face, the bouncer would shove the man to the ground. This happened four times, and each time the determined drunk would hop back up and start the routine all over again... all whilst his seemingly less drunk friend threatened legal action.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the bar to see if they&apos;ve heard from these two in the video, and to find out if their bouncers are licensed. We&apos;ll update when we hear back.
