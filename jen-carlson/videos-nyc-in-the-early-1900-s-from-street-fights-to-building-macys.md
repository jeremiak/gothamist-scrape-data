	<p>We&apos;ve revisited the later half of the 1900s, but the below footage shows New York City in the first decade of the century. The videos show residents walking through blustering snowstorms, parading down what is now Harlem River Drive, and even getting into fights on the street&#x2014;just like today!</p>

<p>This footage from 1902 shows two men getting into a (staged) fight, which is eventually broken up by an officer wielding a nightstick.<br>

<p>This is Broadway at the intersection of Wall Street, in front of Trinity Church<br>

<p>Filmed in 1903, this footage shows &quot;a wharf where a barge is being loaded with trash from two-wheeled, horse-drawn wagons. The trash is dumped off the edge of the pier onto the barge... Probably filmed on the East River, this is one of several New York City Sanitation Department dumping wharves in operation at the time.&quot;<br>
