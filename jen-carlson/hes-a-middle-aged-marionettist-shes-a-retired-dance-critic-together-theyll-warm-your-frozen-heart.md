<p>Meet Ricky Syers, who is 36 years younger than his 86-year-old co-star in this video: Doris Diether, a former dance critic for The Villager. The two met in Washington Square Park while he was puppeteering, and a friendship for a Disney movie blossomed immediately.</p>

<p>Ricky, we&apos;re told, &quot;recently found his calling as an artist and street performer, which has allowed him to live the life he wants.&quot; And now Doris (and the puppet he made her) will join him from time to time. Below, listen to the story of their friendship, because it&apos;s goddamn heartwarming. And sort of like the AARP version of <em>Harold &amp; Maude</em>, but, you know, with less Cat Stevens and less... other stuff.</p>
