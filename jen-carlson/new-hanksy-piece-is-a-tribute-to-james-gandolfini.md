<p>While the city is following the a trail of bread crumbs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061343/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> is dropping daily, New York street artist and pun master <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061343/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a> has put up some new pieces on the Lower East Side and Brooklyn, and one is a tribute to the late great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061343/http://gothamist.com/tags/JamesGandolfini">James Gandolfini</a>. The above piece, at the corner of Orchard and Grand Street, is called Gandalfini, and is a combination of the actor and Gandalf from <em>Lord Of The Rings</em>. We asked him if he had any other ideas for a James Gandolfini piece that got left on the cutting room floor, but it seems it was Gandalfini the whole time&#x2014;Hanksy told us, &quot;My tagline was &apos;one bada bing to rule them all.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>He also put this down by a busted up bike in Brooklyn. Is there a punny <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061343/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/08/the_guy_who_keeps_tagging_the_banks.php">Omar-esque</a> rival to bomb it?</p>
