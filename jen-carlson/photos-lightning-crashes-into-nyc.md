</div></div>					<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216190719/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/muggy_weather_to_give_way_to_thunde.php">we warned earlier</a>, some storms were coming our way this afternoon (and this evening)&#x2014;and, as you probably noticed, the first one just hit. Like, <em>hard</em>. Click through for some photos, including one of the Empire State Building getting zapped&#x2014;fun fact: the Empire State Building is actually struck by lightning on average 23 times each year! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216190719/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">Send us</a> your own if you managed to capture some striking shots. (You can also tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr or hashtag them #Gothamist on Instagram.)</p>

<p>P.S. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216190719/http://www.twitvid.com/NEVOI">Here&apos;s a video</a> of what it looks like when a building is struck, taken during the storm. Hopefully someone out there was making a timelapse of the storm...</p>
