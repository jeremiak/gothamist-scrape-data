<p>There are a few days left to see the &quot;On Creating Reality&quot; exhibit at Maccarone gallery&#x2014;which brings together an extensive collection of ephemera and artifacts from Andy Kaufman&apos;s life. The project is unique, and was pulled together by artist Jonathan Berger in collaboration with the Estate of Andy Kaufman, Lynne Margulies, Bob Zmuda, and Tony Clifton.</p>

<blockquote>The show features photographs, correspondence, performance notation, scripts, props and costumes including the original Tony Clifton jacket, record collections, transcendental meditation materials, hand written drafts of his novel <em>The Huey Williams Story</em>, hundreds of pieces of hate mail he received from women challenging him to wrestle, in addition to numerous personal effects. The exhibition will act as a portrait of an unclassifiable figure in American cultural history whose work has been seminal in the evolution of performance art, new media and relational aesthetics.</blockquote>

<p>You will not find traditional labels explaining what each item is, rather &quot;<strong>a rotating series of Kaufman&apos;s friends, family, and collaborators will be physically present in the exhibition at all times</strong>&quot; to talk with visitors. These guests include Gina Acre, Bill Boggs, Tony Clifton, Prudence Farrow Bruns (Don&apos;t know the name? She&apos;s the subject of the Beatles song &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;), Carol Kane, Michael Kaufman, Carol Kaufman-Kerman, Johnny Legend, Lena Dunham&apos;s mom, Bob Zmuda and many more. But not Andy Kaufman himself, who died in 1984 and would have returned 20 years later if he had in fact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328173041/http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/kaufman.asp">faked his own death</a>.</p>
