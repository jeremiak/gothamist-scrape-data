<p>Captain Picard once stated, &quot;It is possible to commit no errors and still lose.&quot; This seems accurate in describing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006181044/http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/984846-coop-510-park-avenue-lenox-hill-new-york">nearly $15 million apartment</a> that looks like a 1960s sci-fi movie set. Track lighting, carpeting, land lines, clunky-button phones built into furniture, mirrors... all that silver. You created a perfect no-frills 1960s sci-fi set&#x2014;a time capsule even&#x2014;but just because you <em>could</em> doesn&apos;t mean you should have. Oh but you did...</p>

<p>The apartment is located on Park Avenue, light <strike>years</strike>minutes away from Central Park, and is described as &quot;a trophy residence&quot; in the listing, which totally ignores that it looks like how a 1980s businessman would decorate a 1960s sci-fi movie set on a B-movie budget.
