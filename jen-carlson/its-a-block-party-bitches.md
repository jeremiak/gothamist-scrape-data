<p>There&apos;s something we left off of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203152559/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/archives/2004/08/31/sell_outs.php" target="_Blank">Sell Outs</a> list, because it deserves its very own post. </p>

<p><img alt="2004_09_artschappelle.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203152559im_/http://www.gothamist.com/arts/images/2004_09_artschappelle.jpg" width="250" height="150" border="0" p="" align="right" hspace="5/">First because it&apos;s FREE and second because it&apos;s DAVE CHAPPELLE. Actually, there&apos;s a third too, and that is it&apos;s a BLOCK PARTY! </p>

<p>Gothamist was just discussing the lack of block parties in this city. We&apos;d imagine nothing better than closing down a street and drinking with friends on stoops. But we digress. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203152559/http://www.1iota.com/show.aspx?sid=25" target="_Blank">Get your free tickets</a> for this uber block party now!</p>
