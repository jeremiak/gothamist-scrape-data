<p>This Saturday and Sunday simulated explosions will occur of and off for 12 hours on 43rd Street between 8th and 9th Avenues. So don&apos;t panic if you hear noises and see smoke! It&apos;s just Hollywood doin&apos; its thing.</p>

<p>The alert that went out reads: &quot;The filming of a movie will stage the aftermath of a simulated explosion with smoke effects on 43rd Street between 8th and 9th Avenues in Manhattan. The stunt will happen throughout the day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  NYPD and FDNY will be on site.&quot;</p>

<p>What movie is it for? <strike>Possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717093320/http://gothamist.com/tags/spiderman"><em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</em></a>, which took yesterday and today off from shooting, but should be back on tomorrow.</strike> The movie is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717093320/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/"><em>Birdman</em></a> and stars Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts.</p>
