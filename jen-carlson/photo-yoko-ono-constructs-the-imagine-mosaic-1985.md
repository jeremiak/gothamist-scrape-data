<p>This photo of Yoko Ono constructing the Imagine mosaic in Central Park back in 1985 is part of a new book on Strawberry Fields, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151706/http://twitter.com/#!/CentralParkBuzz/status/46225246495322112">Central Park Buzz</a>. It has never been published before.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151706/http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/strawberry-fields.html">Strawberry Fields</a> was designed by Bruce Kelly, the chief landscape architect for the Central Park Conservancy, and inaugurated on what would have been Lennon&apos;s 45th birthday, October 9th, 1985, by Ono, who had underwritten the project. The now iconic mosaic was designed by a team of artists from Naples.</p>
