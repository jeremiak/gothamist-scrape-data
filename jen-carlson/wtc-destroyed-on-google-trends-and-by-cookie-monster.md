										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0109cookiemonster.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161450im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0109cookiemonster.jpg" width="600" height="762" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The cover of Sesame Street magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161450/http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/06/cookie-monster-eats.html">circa October 1976</a> depicts a giant Cookie Monster putting aside his favorite snack for a few bites of the Twin Towers. Sort of makes you think about how innocent the world seemed before the terrorists started blowing shit up, no?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, over at Google Trends, you may notice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161450/http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/06/%E2%9C%88-%E2%96%8C%E2%96%8C-unpleasant-google-trends-subversion/">a more current depiction</a> of the WTC being destroyed, but this falls under the blatantly insensitive category. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161450/http://valleywag.gawker.com/5124652/the-sick-internet-joke-about-911--">Gawker</a> explains that a user on &quot;a site which posts pictures and invites often profane discussion, suggested his peers search on a string of icons &#x2014; &quot;&#x2708; &#x258C;&#x258C;&quot; &#x2014; and thereby launch it onto Google Trends, the search engine&apos;s tracker for swiftly rising Internet phenomena.&quot;</p>
