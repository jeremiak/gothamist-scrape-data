</div></div>					<p>Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205446/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/19/nathan_kensinger_photographer.php">Nathan Kensinger</a> got inside the nooks of the landmark Williamsburgh Savings Bank recently. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205446/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/willie/willie.html">Brooklyn&apos;s Tallest</a> (also known as One Hanson Place) is now home to luxury condos, of course, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205446/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2009/04/williamsburgh-savings-bank.html">Kensinger notes</a> that &quot;few have seen the interior of the bank since it was closed in 2005. Over the last four years, the building has been renovated into a luxury residential complex. Work is still not finished and many residential spaces remain empty, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205446/http://www.onehanson.com/#/FLOORPLANS%20%26%20AVAILABILITY/">Penthouse A</a>, with its two private observation decks. Soon, though, the building will be completely filled and permanently closed to the public.&quot;</p>
