	<p>At 7 a.m. this morning people were already lined up to shop at the newly reopened Fairway market in Red Hook, which had been closed since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512021533/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> hit late last October. But first, they had to wait for the grand reopening ceremony to take place, where Mayor Bloomberg, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, Senator Chuck Schumer, Miss America Mallory Hagen, and Fairway president Howie Glickberg (amongst others) were on hand to cut the ribbon.</p>

<p>During the ceremony, Bloomberg described his favorite item at the store&#x2014;an onion bagel with schmear, before being presented with a bag filled with the items (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512021533/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/mayor_bloomberg_presented_with_port.php">a bad-ass portrait</a>). Markowitz, who said he&apos;s there so much he considers himself part of the Glickberg family, said he has felt like &quot;a wandering Jew again&quot; in the supermarket&apos;s absence, noting that neither himself or his wife cook, and rely a lot on the market&apos;s prepared foods. He also called for the building of two more Fairways in Brooklyn, which we&apos;re pretty sure would be well-received by the borough! As for Schumer, he half-joked that the Red Hook Fairway&#x2014;which opened in 2006&#x2014;was his wife&apos;s idea, and they consider it their own personal market. </p>
