To keep things equal, they were all consumed plain and untoasted. Spoiler alert: Dunkin&apos; Donuts <em>didn&apos;t</em> come in last. For shame, New York. <em>For. Shame.</em><p></p>

<p>Some other surprises, the control group says, &quot;Once schmeared, there&apos;s nothing wrong with a good old H&amp;H; Bagel. But on their own ... found them dense and sweet.&quot; And over at Ess-A-Bagel they&apos;re allegedly serving up &quot;funky, almost moldy-tasting&quot; bagels.</p>

<p>Amongst the best of the best were Terrace Bagel (in Windsor Terrace), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045608/http://www.murraysbagels.com/index2.htm">Murray&apos;s</a> in Manhattan and Hot Bialys in Flushing; but unsurprisingly varying opinions seemed to make it <em>nearly</em> impossible to declare a #1 Bagel in NYC. The site ultimately did claim one victor, however: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045608/http://www.bagelhole.net/">Bagel Hole</a> on 7th Avenue in Brooklyn. They declared, &quot;It made a satisfying crunching sound when I bit into it; the exterior actually required the use of my teeth; it was a lovely dark brown color; it was moist and almost light on the inside, and it wasn&apos;t absurdly large.&quot; Plus they have the advantage of all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045608/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/10/florida_baker_recreates_brooklyn_wa.php">that Brooklyn water</a>.</p>
