Three agents represented this time around, bringing IE&apos;s latest mission to Starbucks, where they managed to confuse fellow patrons by bringing in their old, clunky desktop computers (complete with WIndows 95!). The trio hooked up their time machines and got to work, one even able to surf the World Wide Web. For those who didn&apos;t think Starbucks had set up a computer lab as a service to their customers, it was a baffling scene. </p>
