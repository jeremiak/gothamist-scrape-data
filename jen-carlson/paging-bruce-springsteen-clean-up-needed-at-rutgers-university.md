<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="snookiboss0411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412131532im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/snookiboss0411.jpg" width="365" height="220" class="image-left"> </span>Remember earlier this month when a bunch of Rutgers students used actual money to bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412131532/http://gothamist.com/tags/snooki">Snooki of <em>Jersey Shore</em></a> to their school? Paying her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412131532/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/snooki_gets_paid_more_than_toni_mor.php">more than</a> Nobel winning author Toni Morrison? Ha, <em>kids these days right</em>... well now some <em>other</em> students at the school want to undo it all by inviting Bruce Springsteen to the campus. There&apos;s even a Facebook campaign, titled &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412131532/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=190142874363013">College Ave Freeze Out: Let&apos;s Bring the Boss to Rutgers!</a>&#x201D; Let&apos;s move past the fact that this is such a predictable choice&#x2014;<em>New Jersey people want to book Bruce Springteen!</em>&#x2014;and see what Facebook campaign head Daniel Oliveto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412131532/http://beta.courierpostonline.com/article/20110411/NEWS02/110411015/Students-want-Bruce-Springsteen-to-clean-up-Rutgers--image-after-Snooki-appearance">has to say</a>.</p>

<p>Oliveto, along with Paul Tran&#xAD;quilli, have proposed the booking of The Boss, and say, &#x2018;&#x2019;We&#x2019;re a smart institu&#xAD;tion. We&#x2019;ve produced Nobel Prize winners. We have a great reputation. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to see it burned to the ground by Snooki or any&#xAD;one else.&#x201D; He added that the campaign is also to reverse &quot;some of the other hits Rut&#xAD;gers has taken recently&quot;&#x2014;like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412131532/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/body_found_in_hudson_believed_to_be.php">the Tyler Clementi incident</a>. Not sure The Boss can help with that, but basically, in the end, Oliveto is looking for positive press for the school.</p>

<p>Can Bruce save Rutgers? Could performing there tarnish <em>his</em> image?! Stay tuned, as all eyes are now fixed on the student&apos;s mission to book an &quot;honest, working individual... that transcends socie&#xAD;tal bounds.&quot;</p>
