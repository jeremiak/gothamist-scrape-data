<span class="photo_caption">The only real Banksy stencil stand, 2013.</span></p>

<p>Every couple of months we receive an email declaring that &quot;Banksy is back,&quot; which is either stated as fact in the subject line or posed as a question. <em>Banksy is back?</em> What these suckers are asking is if they should purchase a stencil from someone who has set up a stand on the street, just like Banksy did that one time in 2013.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/13/video_banksy_set_up_a_pop_up_booth.php">Banksy&apos;s stand</a> was set up around Central Park for a few hours as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://gothamist.com/tags/betteroutthanin">his month-long residency</a> here&#x2014;no one knew it was his latest installment, but three people were into the stencils enough that they shelled out $60 a pop. One expert later priced each one closer to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/13/banksy_3.php">$95,000</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally, the city&apos;s entrepreneurs began popping up with their own stands selling very similar, almost identical, stencils, hoping to make a quick buck. This is still happening three years later.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="phpHeVqX9PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpHeVqX9PM.jpg" width="350" height="283"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> Banksy AND Keith Haring stencils at one stand? SCORE.</i></div> So: did you just pass by a Banksy-looking stencil stand? Are you about to email us asking if you should buy the Banksy-looking stencil? I don&apos;t know, should you buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/05/armani_jacket_scam.php">that &quot;Armani&quot; jacket</a>? Not if you are looking for authenticity. But if you actually like the stencil, or the jacket, <em>why not?</em> Even Andy Warhol originals were really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://revolverwarholgallery.com/andy-warhol-screenprints-process-history/">Styria Studios Inc. originals</a>. How many degrees of separation in outsourcing an artist&apos;s work makes it no longer real?<p></p>

<p>And is the stencil not real no matter who created it? Can you not hold it in your hands, gaze at it, hang it on your wall? <em>Are you only in this life for the money?</em> Maybe you should take your $60 and buy a mirror, and have a nice long look. </p>

<p>The latest inquiry about one of these stands came from &quot;anonymous&quot; yesterday, who wrote: &quot;Just spotted guy selling Banksy paintings near corner of 7th &amp; 41st Street. See photos attached. Airbrush paintings are on canvas with wood frames. Price: $60 each for any size.  He had limited selection, seems to be going pretty fast this time.  Fake or real?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Fake. Always fake,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;But maybe this time it&apos;s real... just another one of Banksy&apos;s games,&quot; anonymous replied. &quot;It&apos;s &apos;always fake&apos; until it&apos;s not. Fucked up.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, just like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/black_tap_milkshake_insanity.php">four hour lines for milkshakes</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/17/crunning_down_a_dream.php">crunning</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050345/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">President Trump</a>, it is indeed &quot;fucked up.&quot; How WILL we ever know the difference between what is real and what is real-but-not-of-monetary-value?</p>

<p>We reached out to Banksy&apos;s publicist, Jo Brooks, to get a definitive answer to this question: &quot;Will Banksy ever set up a stencil stand in New York City again?&quot;</p>

<p>Brooks has yet to answer, so we may never know.</p>
