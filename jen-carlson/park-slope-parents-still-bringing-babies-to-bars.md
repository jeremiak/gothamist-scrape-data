She opines, &quot;No matter what breeders might think, bars are not family-friendly. If I am out drinking and sobbing about a bad breakup, I don&#x2019;t want my cries to compete with those of an infant sitting next to me. If I go to the bathroom to correct my wayward mascara at the end of a long weekend night, I don&#x2019;t want to watch a baby being wiped down on the soggy sink counter.&quot;<p></p>

<p>According to Chubinsky, the breeders have now taken over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075810/http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gate-brooklyn">the Gate</a>, where parents dare wag their fingers upon hearing the regular, non-stroller-pushing crowd spew out curse words. And that&apos;s not all, parents from Gowanus to Astoria have been spotted lining up baby bottles on bars, and changing diapers on tables! But at least their babies aren&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075810/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/flashback_1.php">chillin&apos; on fire escapes</a>?</p>

<p>So... should the parents boozing it up with babies in tow be the ones on the receiving end of a judgmental finger wag? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075810/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/16/park_slope_1.php">Last year</a> the stroller mafia was even scolded for bringing their little ones to romantic restaurants.</p>
