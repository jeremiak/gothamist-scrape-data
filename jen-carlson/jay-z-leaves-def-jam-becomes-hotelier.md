This was just one of many things that signaled more changes for the major, and now it turns out that the president of Def Jam, Jay-Z, is stepping down from his position. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054836/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/25/business/25music.html?_r=1&amp;ref=music&amp;oref=slogin">NY Times</a> reports:</p><blockquote>Jay-Z made the announcement with Def Jam&#x2019;s parent, Universal Music Group, as his employment contract was expiring. Under a separate long-term recording contract with Def Jam, Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, still owes the company one or more albums.</blockquote>Upon his departure he stated, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s time for me to take on new challenges.&#x201D; What&apos;s left after already having his hand in a fashion line, nightclubs, the New Jersey Nets and of course the music industry? Looks like the most immediate project is a downtown 5-star hotel. Jay-Z <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054836/http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/news/88372.php">purchased a development site in Chelsea</a> which will be home to a 150,000 square-foot luxury hotel called The J-Hotel -- he hopes this will be the flagship of what a chain that will span the nation&apos;s major cities.<p></p>

<p>The $66.4 million spot will be located at 511 W 21st Street. There&apos;s no word on when you can expect to make reservations, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054836/http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2007/12/12/151539/23/hotels/Jay_Z_To_Open_J_Hotel_in_NYC">Hotel Chatter</a> projects a 2009/2010 opening. </p>
