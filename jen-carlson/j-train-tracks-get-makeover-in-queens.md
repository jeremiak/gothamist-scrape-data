<p>The Jamaica Avenue J is about to get a makeover that will hopefully make residents of Woodhaven and Richmond Hill, Queens slightly less bummed out when they&apos;re walking to the subway. MTA officials told City Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley this week that that part of the span will be repaired and painted forest green next year, according to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811064337/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/06/18/2010-06-18_with_facelift_vow_things_looking_up_under_j_train_el.html"> the Daily News</a>. Currently the underside of the tracks are covered in chipped paint, dirt and grease&#x2014;decades worth of it, at that. </p>

<p>The project will take 30 months, and cost almost $30MM (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811064337/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=jamaica+avenue+richmond+hill&amp;sll=40.692614,-73.857222&amp;sspn=0.016758,0.035276&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Jamaica+Ave,+Queens,+New+York+11418&amp;ll=40.701236,-73.831987&amp;spn=0.016625,0.035276&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.699746,-73.831908&amp;panoid=HNOz5N0uRIZgCRWuz6DiyQ&amp;cbp=12,261.54,,0,-40.51">here&apos;s the before shot</a> of Richmond Hill&apos;s span). One resident told the paper, &quot;We take care of our properties. They should have done this 10 years ago,&quot; and added with skepticism, &quot;We&apos;ve been promised this before.&quot;</p>
