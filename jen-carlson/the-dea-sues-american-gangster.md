The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229101829/http://www.nysun.com/article/69697">NY Sun</a> reports that Former DEA agents are suing NBC Universal for being falsely depicted on-screen.</p>

<p>They feel their characters were portrayed as villains and the lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan, claims &quot;the movie defamed hundreds of DEA agents and New York police officers by claiming at the end that Frank Lucas&apos;s collaboration with prosecutors led to the convictions of three quarters of New York City&apos;s Drug Enforcement Agency.&quot; The DEA claims that Lucas, a government informant after his conviction, never got any of them convicted.</p><blockquote>&quot;This is absolutely off-the-wall,&quot; a prosecutor in the federal case against Lucas in 1975 who now represents the DEA agents, Dominic Amorosa, said.<p></p>

<p>Mr. Amorosa said the filmmakers had unfairly blackened the reputation of agents who risked their lives to put away Lucas and other drug felons in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what these people were thinking, but they are going to pay for it,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote>Universal maintains that &quot;the corrupt law enforcers depicted in the film were supposed to be New York police officers.&quot; Wonder if the NYPD will be next to file suit! Incidentally, the movie has grossed $127 million...and the lawsuit is for $62 million.<p></p>
