<p>Who knew that one of the nation&apos;s most beloved adult contemporary musicians (or someone that looks an awful lot like him*) was such a bad ass! In the below video, you&apos;ll see Neil Diamond (or some guy that looks like him) single-handedly trying to push out drug dealers and crack addicts in Greenwich Village <em>with his billy club</em>. This was in 1986, when the crack epidemic was hitting its peak in many of the country&apos;s cities, and in the below video, this guy&#x2014;<em>whoever he is</em>&#x2014;is clearly fed up, saying:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I live here... they come and urinate in the doorway, they throw their crack vials all over... for residents of the Village it&apos;s an atrocity, it&apos;s criminal. And no one seems to do anything. I have to come out armed because I&apos;m afraid that by chasing them they&apos;ll attack me. The whole neighborhood is a junkyard for drugs.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>*Note: It&apos;s unclear if this is actually THE Neil Diamond, but we want to believe.</p>
