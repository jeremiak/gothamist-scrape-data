                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="subsharkmontage.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173316im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/subsharkmontage.jpg" width="640" height="500" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>If we are to believe the Taiwanese animators&apos; lore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173316/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/photos_dead_shark_on_subway.php#photo-1">of the Subway Shark</a>, and why wouldn&apos;t we, then here&apos;s what happened: three tourist sharks visited the Big Apple, ate hot dogs at Gray&apos;s Papaya, murdered some people, went to the Statue of Liberty, and then one was caught eating a human who couldn&apos;t get through the subway turnstile fast enough. At that point, the NYPD stop and frisked him, found a bowl, tazed him, and presumably tossed him on the subway, where he then smoked a cigarette, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173316/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/weekend_at_bernies_subway_shark.php#photo-1">drank a Red Bull</a>, went to Williamsburg, killed more people, and died. The End. Or rather, FIN. (Shark puns you guys.)</p>

<p>Get the popcorn and dim the lights! It&apos;s Subway Shark, the short film.</p>

<p>We may never know the true story behind Subway Shark, but we have some theories coming up that are much more depressing than this. Stay tuned.</p>
