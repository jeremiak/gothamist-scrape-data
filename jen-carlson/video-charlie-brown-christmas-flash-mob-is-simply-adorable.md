<p>When it comes to word combinations that will fill you with dread, &quot;Flash Mob&quot; is 2nd only to &quot;Jazz Brunch.&quot; But this adorable little troupe managed to pull one off that&apos;s rather cute, because who doesn&apos;t love the Peanuts gang, a little Vince Guaraldi, and some awkwardly idiosyncratic dance moves? And it&apos;s not even a marketing trick pulled off by some evil conglomerate! (OR IS IT?) So, enjoy:</p>

<p>Also, you can watch the real... animated thing on Thursday at 8 p.m. on ABC.
