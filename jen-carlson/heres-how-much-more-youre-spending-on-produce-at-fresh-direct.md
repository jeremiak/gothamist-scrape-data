<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phploBL8GAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154247im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phploBL8GAM.jpg" width="223" height="211" class="image-right"> </span>Recently I discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154247/http://www.yelp.com/biz/atlantic-fruit-and-vegetables-brooklyn">Atlantic Fruits and Vegetables</a>, a small produce shop on the Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill border. Every neighborhood has something like this place (when I lived in Ridgewood I would make daily trips to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154247/http://www.yelp.com/biz/fancy-fruits-and-vegetables-ridgewood">Fancy Fruits and Vegetables</a>), albeit some are better than others. This one happens to be stellar, with a great selection of fresh produce, some staple items, and spectacularly low prices... particularly in comparison to, say, Fresh Direct. </p>

<p>Curious about the price difference, I compared my haul today to what it would cost at the online grocer and there was a pretty stunning difference&#x2014;at Atlantic Fruits and Vegetables the items totaled up to $25.89. At Fresh Direct the same exact items (at approximately the same amount/weights) would have cost $42.06 (with shipping: $48.73). While obviously Fresh Direct was going to be more expensive, a nearly $25 difference seems worth pointing out.</p>

<p>So, if you aren&apos;t already, get your granny cart and find the freshest produce shop within walking distance of your apartment.</p>
