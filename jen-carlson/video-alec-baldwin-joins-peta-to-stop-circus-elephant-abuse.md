<p>If Alec Baldwin fell out of favor with you after his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308002739/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/alec_baldwin_may_have_just_been_kic.php">in-flight tantrum</a>, then he might just win you back with this. The actor has teamed up with PETA in a new campaign against the Ringling Bros. Circus. In the below four-minute video, he narrates the life of a circus elephant from birth, to being &quot;broken,&quot; to getting bullhooked by trainers. The video shows footage of the elephants being tortured by circus employees&#x2014;footage that is even more disturbing than PETA&apos;s original video documenting the abuse, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308002739/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/22/peta_has_video_of_ringling_bros_bea.php">we published in 2009</a>.</p>

<p>The circus&apos;s controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308002739/http://gothamist.com/tags/elephantwalk">Elephant Walk</a> usually takes place in March, but this year (this weekend, in fact) they&apos;re over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308002739/http://www.ringling.com/TourSchedule.aspx?action=marketsearch&amp;marketId=979">in New Jersey</a> instead of New York City.</p>
