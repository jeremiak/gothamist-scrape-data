<p>Have you ever wondered what the main color in the New York City sky is at any given moment? Well <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520020435/https://twitter.com/#!/mikebodge">Mike Bodge</a> is telling you every five minutes with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520020435/http://nskyc.com/">his website</a> that captures the average color of the sky. As we type this at 9:45 a.m., should you be gazing up and thinking, &quot;this is the color I want to paint my walls,&quot; it&apos;s at #F3F4F3... but you might want to wait until some softer tones come into the mix.</p>
