title: PETA Shows Video Of Ringling Bros. Workers Beating Animals
---

<p>It&apos;s unsurprising that Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus has been called out in the past for abusing their animals, but it&apos;s another thing to see it all on tape. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065553/https://secure.peta.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=2359">PETA went undercover</a> this year and captured Ringling workers on video beating and whipping elephants. The organization announced their findings today at a press conference (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065553/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/102726/video-shows-ringling-brothers-handlers-hitting-elephants/Default.aspx">NY1 has footage</a>), calling upon Madison Square Garden to ban the circus, or at least the use of animals in their show.</p>

<p>This summer expects to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065553/http://hsus.typepad.com/wayne/2009/02/ringling-trial.html">finally see a verdict</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065553/http://www.bornfreeusa.org/a1a6f_updates.php">in a lawsuit</a> filed against Ringling, which centers around the circus&apos;s use of steel-barbed bullhooks, electric prods, and shackles on the elephants. PETA&apos;s new footage also shows abuse to the circus&apos;s tigers. They say workers struck animals on the head, face, ears, legs, and other parts of their bodies with bullhooks and other abusive handling tools. &quot;The unit&apos;s animal superintendant and head elephant trainer were among those who used bullhooks&#x2014;sharp, fireplace pokerlike devices&#x2014;to hook and yank elephants by their sensitive skin.&quot; Their skin, by the way, is as sensitive as human&apos;s.</p>

<p>While this is <em>all on tape</em>, Ringling has thus far not commented on the footage and merely called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065553/http://gothamist.com/tags/peta">PETA</a> &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065553/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/07/22/2009-07-22_peta_video_shows_ringing_bros_handlers_beating_elephants.html">an extremist animal rights group</a>.&quot; Perhaps they need some prodding by a bullhook to get them talking.</p>
