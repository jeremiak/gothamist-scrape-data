<p>Tonight, at 11:57 p.m. on the dot, crowds will come together in Times Square to sing John Lennon&apos;s &quot;Imagine,&quot; as Yoko Ono&apos;s anti-violence film &quot;Imagine Peace&quot; plays on billboards in the background. The celebration of peace comes one week after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151554/http://gothamist.com/tags/newtownshooting">tragic shooting</a> at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, and is a collaboration between Ono, Times Square Arts, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151554/http://www.artproductionfund.org/projects/yoko-ono-imagine-peace-times-square">Art Production Fund</a>, and Make Music New York.</p>

<blockquote>IMAGINE PEACE is Yoko Ono&apos;s worldwide initiative of anti-violence. In the film, the words &quot;Imagine Peace&quot; are written in 24 languages set over the tranquil imagery of a blue-sky background. The piece has been transformed into a multi-channel work specifically for Times Square, and spreads the message of peace across Times Square&apos;s monumental screens simultaneously</blockquote>.
