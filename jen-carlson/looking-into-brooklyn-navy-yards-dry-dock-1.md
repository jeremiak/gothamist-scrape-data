<p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard contains more than the old, crumbling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202418/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/02/inside_admirals_row.php">Admiral&apos;s Row homes</a> that are often romanticized in photos (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202418/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/31/admirals_row_1.php">likely to vanish</a> in the near future). Recently one photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202418/http://citynoise.org/article/9284">documented Dry Dock 1</a>, the 3rd oldest dry dock in the country, completed in 1851 and costing $2 million at the time. Last year architect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202418/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2008/07/architects_diar.php">Brendan Coburn</a> noted that it was &quot;Fashioned entirely from massive, hand-cut and hand-sanded blocks of granite excavated from a quarries in Maine, Connecticut, Staten Island and upstate New York, its size, form, and general aesthetic bring to mind a Roman ruin.&quot;</p>

<p>While the dock still maintains and repairs ships, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202418/http://citynoise.org/article/9284">CityNoise</a> concludes their documentation of it with a list of ships that were <em>built</em> there during the 19th century, including &quot;the Niagara (1867): the ship that laid the first successful transatlantic cable, Halstead&#x2019;s Folly or The Intelligent Whale (1872) the prototype of the first submarines ever built, and The Maine (1897) which had a very short sailing life before it exploded in Havana Harbor, setting off the Spanish American War in 1898.&quot;</p>
