<p><em>The New Yorker</em> is celebrating the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011851/http://sfist.com/tags/doma">overturning of DOMA</a> on their upcoming cover, which features Bert and Ernie&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011851/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/06/new-yorker-cover-bert-ernie-gay-marriage.html">moment of joy</a>.&quot; The two <em>Sesame Street</em> puppets are pictured sharing a very human moment, cuddled up on a couch looking at the Supreme Court on their television screen&#x2014;it&apos;s enough to make even the coldest heart melt.

<p>Cover artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011851/http://jackhunter-sketchbook.blogspot.com/">Jack Hunter</a> submitted the image to a Tumblr, according to the publication&#x2014;he wrote, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s amazing to witness how attitudes on gay rights have evolved in my lifetime. This is great for our kids, a moment we can all celebrate.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Hunter actually created the cover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011851/http://oddmanoutphx.tumblr.com/post/23724806556/blown-covers-gay-marriage-i-was-extremely">last year</a> for a contest, with President Obama on the television screen instead. At the time, he said, &quot;While I&#x2019;m certainly not the first person to speculate about Bert &amp; Ernie&#x2019;s more personal and private relationship, I thought they were well suited to represent how a lot of gay couples must have felt hearing Obama&#x2019;s comments &#x2026; after all, they&#x2019;ve been together for almost 50 years &#x2026; as &apos;just friends&apos; or otherwise.&quot;</p>
