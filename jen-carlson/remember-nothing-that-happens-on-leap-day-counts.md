<p>Much like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115621/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/06/daylight_saving_time_manifesto.php">Daylight Saving Time</a>, Leap Day is nonsense. Here is how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_29">Wikipedia</a> explains the existence of February 29th every four years: &quot;a date that occurs in most years that are divisible by 4, such as 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024. Years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 did not contain a leap day, 2100, 2200, and 2300 will not contain a leap day, while 1600 and 2000 did, and 2400 will.&quot; Life is so weird! Who made up these rules, anyway? </p>

<p>The day is added to the calendar every four years &quot;because a complete revolution around the Sun takes slightly longer than 365 days, [and] it compensates for this lag.&quot; What would happen if we didn&apos;t make up for this lag? Nothing. Because measuring time is just some strange human thing we do. So the best place to celebrate Leap Day is within the realm of fiction.</p>

<p>During its sixth season, <em>30 Rock</em> gave us Leap Day William, who is part Lucky Charms mascot, part Santa Claus, and part marine creature. Leap Day William emerges from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench">Mariana Trench</a> every four years to trade candy for children&apos;s tears. And on that day, everyone wears yellow and blue, and spews forth YOLO-esque catch phrases like: &quot;Real life is for March!&quot; and &quot;Nothing that happens on Leap Day counts.&quot; <em>30 Rock</em> made Leap Day the Las Vegas of holidays, and it&apos;s that spirit that you should embrace today, not that silly sun science above.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115621/http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/leap-day-30-rock-episode-backstory.html">Vulture</a> has some comments from <em>30 Rock</em> co-creator Robert Carlock on their Leap Day episode&#x2014;he explained:</p><blockquote>&quot;What if we made a big deal out of Leap Day?&quot; Suddenly, you&apos;re handed everything associated with any holiday, and you get to recast it. &quot;Oh, great, we&apos;ll do a Scrooge conceit.&quot; &quot;We&apos;ll go to a Leap Day party.&quot; &quot;We&apos;ll write songs.&quot; &quot;We&apos;ll come up with traditions.&quot; You just saw the whole thing immediately, even though I think we were telling four full stories in it.</blockquote> <p></p>

<p>As for Jim Carrey, who portrays Leap Dave Williams in the movie within the show, <em>Leap Dave Williams</em>, Carlock says, &quot;Jim had a ton of ideas we tried to incorporate. There was that shot of him running down the sidewalk, and it was like the end-of-movie moment &#x2014; &apos;I was very connected with my son and I solved the court case from earlier!&apos; &#x2014; and he&apos;s tearing his clothes off. That was not scripted, but it was wonderful. I wish it happened in my life more. And of course, having Alec running around New York crying, &apos;Happy Leap Day!&apos; like it&apos;s the end of <em>It&apos;s A Wonderful Life</em>.&quot;</p>
