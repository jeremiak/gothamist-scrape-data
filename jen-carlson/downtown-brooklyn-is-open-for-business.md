Sure, they&apos;ve got an Urban Outfitters and Trader Joe&apos;s, but they&apos;re looking to make the area &quot;a vibrant, 24/7, live-work urban center&quot;. (Hoboken has allegedly been stealing their business over the past 10 years!). So Marty Markowitz has officially stated they&apos;re &quot;&apos;open for business&apos; and&#x2014;with all due respect to our friends in Jersey&#x2014;our borough is the very best place for companies to locate and employees to live, work, and raise families.&quot; The Downtown Brooklyn Partnership promises &quot;a mix of advertising, direct marketing, promotional events and other activities&quot; to help attain their goal. So, a round of J&#xE4;ger shots to celebrate?</p>
