<p>The Straphangers Campaign, Brooklyn Borough president Marty Markowitz and even bagpiper John Maynard came together today to mourn the passing of the Z train. A mock funeral was held at the Fulton Street-Broadway/Nassau subway station in Manhattan, and those in attendance tell us that there was also a &quot;call on lawmakers and the MTA to save the Z line in its 2009 budget.&quot; So what does this mean, besides having to refer to the line as the JM now?</p><blockquote>Loss of the Z would end &quot;skip stop&quot; service on the J line during rush hours between Jamaica, Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, adding an hour extra each week in commuting for many riders, according to the Straphangers Campaign.</blockquote>Markowitz lent some comforting words to those grieving the subway&apos;s passing: &quot;Friends, New Yorkers, straphangers&#x2014;I come to praise the Z train, not to bury it. Though the Z train begins in Queens and ends in Manhattan, it is&#x2014;like the J&#x2014;Brooklyn to the core. When trains like the Z die, our City&apos;s economy dies with them. This is why we grieve at this mock funeral today. Let&apos;s hope these are not the Z&apos;s last rites. Long live the Z!&quot; The news of the Z landing on the MTA&apos;s chopping block was just one of the many, many issues touched upon at the the first public hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042857/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/hundreds_give_mta_piece_of_their_mi.php">last night</a>...but what about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042857/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/mta_may_eliminate_w_train_among_oth.php">poor &apos;ol W</a>?<p></p>
