<p>In the history of <em>Live</em>, the co-hosts have always worked for one reason, and it&apos;s the same reason most romantic relationships work: you&apos;ve got two personality types. </p>

<p>We started with Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford, where the former&apos;s role was mostly to react to the latter&apos;s jovial morning show filler talk. Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501203021/http://gothamist.com/tags/kellyripa">Kelly Ripa</a> stepped in as Philbin&apos;s new co-host, amazingly providing even more energy than Gifford, and ultimately stealing the show because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501203021/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/12/watch_kelly_ripa_get_ripped_on_broa.php">Ripa is a goddamn gem</a> and doesn&apos;t even need a co-host. </p>

<p>Still, when Philbin left she got a new one&#x2014;Michael Strahan filled the empty seat, but he eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501203021/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/04/kelly-ripa-michael-strahan-abc-live-good-morning-america">turned his back on Ripa</a> while securing himself a new position at <em>Good Morning America</em>. </p>

<p>Ripa was once again alone, holding the whole thing together by herself and succeeding because she is a powerhouse, but she&apos;s getting a new co-host anyway, and it&apos;s Ryan Seacrest. </p>

<p>This is simply <em>too much energy</em> for one morning show.  Please reconsider.</p>

<p>Seacrest is basically the Ripa of men, meaning not only is he wealthy, white, successful, and in the same age bracket, but he is <em>also</em> a positive energy merchant. There is only room for one of those. Might we suggest a personality type closer to a Charles Bukowski or even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501203021/http://gothamist.com/tags/michaelshannon">Michael Shannon</a>.</p>
