										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="lobstertastrophe0513.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005912im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lobstertastrophe0513.jpg" width="342" height="270"> <br> <i style=" width:342px; ;display:block"> This photo does not help matters.</i></div> Last month when a lobster roll was transformed into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005912/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/behold_the_tex-japanese_lobster_rol.php">a Tex-Japanese monster sandwich</a>, we pleaded with whoever is making lobster rolls out there to keep it simple. But there&apos;s always that one fool who thinks they can still improve upon perfection... <p></p>

<p>The folks at Cert&#xE9; have announced that this month, and this month only, they&apos;ll be offering something called the &quot;Count of Stonington,&quot; which is basically a lobster french toast sandwich. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005912/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2013/06/certe-june-sandwich-special-lobster-french-toast.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+seriouseats%2Fnewyork+%28Serious+Eats%3A+New+York%29">Serious Eats</a> says the concoction contains &quot;two thick pieces of eggy vanilla-honey french toast with coarse sea salt... a fistfull of lobster salad, with small chunks of sweet, tender meat and a generous helping of mayo. The salad gets topped with a thick crisp of Grana Padano.&quot; (Let us Google that for you: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005912/http://www.slashfood.com/2010/08/31/grana-padano-cheese-course/">Grana Padano</a> is a hard cheese with &quot;a fruity aroma, firm texture, and sweet caramel-like taste.&quot;)</p>

<p>The sandwich is just under $10 though, which might make it worth trying?</p>
