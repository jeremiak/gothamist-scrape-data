<p>Getting in to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032055/http://gothamst.com/tags/saturdaynightlive">Saturday Night Live</a> taping is not easy. Not if you know someone hosting the show. Not if your cousin is BFFs with Lorne Michaels.  Not even if you slept with a cast member and are still on sort of okay terms with him/her. Your best shot is to enter the annual lottery for tickets&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032055/http://www.nbc.com/tickets/">which is happening <em>now</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;To enter the Saturday Night Live ticket lottery for the upcoming 2013-2014 season send an email in the month of August only to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032055/mailto:snltickets@nbcuni.com">snltickets@nbcuni.com</a>. Please include all contact information and do not request a specific date. If you are selected, you will receive two tickets to a random show date and time. You may only send one email per household and all audience members must be at least 16 years of age. Please note that entering the lottery does not guarantee tickets, and you will only be notified in the event that you are chosen.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Should that fail (it probably will, just being honest), then there&apos;s always the stand-by tickets. That&apos;s also pretty hopeless, especially if someone like Louis CK is hosting&#x2014;last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032055/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/louis_ck_line.php">that line formed</a> at least a day ahead of his appearance. <em>Just imagine what it was like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032055/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/10/videos_justin_bieber_and_his_belieb.php">for Justin Bieber</a>.</em> But as a wise Belieber once said: YOLO. So if you want to give it a shot, those tickets get distributed at 7 a.m. on the morning of the show, for both dress rehearsal and the live broadcast. But there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032055/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/i_waited_on_line_for_cronuts_and_ha.php">no Cronut</a> at the end of that line, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032055/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/rain_room.php">no Rain Room</a>, there&apos;s no 1975 cast, there&apos;s just something that you could have seen on television at home on your couch alone.</p>
