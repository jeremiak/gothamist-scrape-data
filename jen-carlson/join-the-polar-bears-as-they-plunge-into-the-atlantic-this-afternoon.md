<p>It&apos;s going to be a downright balmy day, with a high in the mid-50s, so if you ever considered jumping into the Atlantic Ocean on January 1st, this is the January 1st for you! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082629/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/01/photos_coney_island_new_years_day_p.php">Last year</a> Polar Bear swimmers also got weather in the 50s, but there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082629/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/02/more_photos_from_polar_bear_swim_20.php#photo-1">snow on the ground</a>, which can really psych a person out. This year, it&apos;s all clear skies (full hearts, can&apos;t lose), so there&apos;s nothing to stop you. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082629/http://www.polarbearclub.org/">Coney Island Polar Bear Club</a> is the oldest winter bathing organization in the United States, so you&apos;ll be out there with the experts.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082629/http://gothamist.com/tags/polarbearclub">The club</a>&apos;s New Year&apos;s Day swim is open to the public, and they&apos;ll be assembling on the Boardwalk at Stillwell Avenue before the 1 p.m. swim. They note that you should bring &quot;warm clothes, surf boots or old sneakers, towels, and definitely bring your camera.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082629/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">Send us</a> your photos or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr if you are there taking the plunge (or as a spectator).</p>
