<p>Well, this is only a few seasons late, but in case you&apos;re just catching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062043/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/cloverfield"><em>Cloverfield</em></a> for the first time on DVD it may seem relevant! The map above was created to tell people &quot;where things in <em>Cloverfield</em> happen okay.&quot; Find out just where the monster punted the Statue of Liberty&apos;s head from, and much much more. Warning: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062043/http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;om=%3D0&amp;msid=106355793162209761440.00044537c4b75d0503ab1&amp;ll=40.673868,-73.879623&amp;spn=0.372874,0.590515&amp;z=11">the descriptions</a> contain a lot of <em>likes</em>, <em>dudes</em> and <em>oh my gods</em>, okay?</p>
