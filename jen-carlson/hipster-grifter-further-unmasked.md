</div></div>					<p>Tracking down a grifter should really be much more challenging, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/15/hipster_grifter.php">Kari Ferrell</a> has left her mark all over the internet for anyone to find. Perhaps she&apos;s been purposely leaving footprints, even commenting on FreeWilliamsburg back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2009/03/my_new_favorite.html#comment-1368050">on March 4th</a>, linking to her own photos. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://gawker.com/5214573/kari-ferrell-hipster-grifter-the-illustrated-life">Gawker</a> picked up on her trail and has delved into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://s13.photobucket.com/albums/a261/karithecrucial/?start=all">her Photobucket account</a>, and since her story broke yesterday images have been popping up everywhere, with at least one person who encountered her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://www.flickr.com/photos/gb/sets/72157616731353605/">starting a Flickr set</a> with not-yet-seen pics. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://groups.myspace.com/slpdkariferrel">A MySpace group</a> dedicated to catching her was even started in February.</p>

<p>She seemed to use the &quot;KariTheCrucial&quot; username a lot, on top of the Korean Abdul-Jabbar moniker, and at one point was even looking for a roommate on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://www.veggieroommate.com/viewProfile.aspx?member=5446">Veggie Roommate</a>&#x2014;one who didn&apos;t drink, smoke or do drugs, because she&apos;s straight edge, of course (maybe this was back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://www.miconian.com/2009/04/16/my-life-with-kari-ferrell/">her kitten-saving days</a>). For those who feel the need to get more involved in this downward spiral, there are currently dueling Facebook groups in homage to the con artist, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=66944661091">one started by</a> comedian Dave Hill who hosted Smiths Speed Dating in Greenpoint last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://twitter.com/mrdavehill/status/1529937546">and Twittered</a> that she was there (she wasn&apos;t).</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that this is clearly a troubled person, let&apos;s end this with a comment her dad allegedly left <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6127200538906915738&amp;postID=7295630688462928805&amp;pli=1">on one blog</a> stating, in part, &quot;She had a very spoiled upbringing. I have no idea how she turned out this way, but I hope she gets help and whatever treatment is needed. Kari if you&apos;re reading this turn yourself in. I love you.&quot; Don&apos;t feel too badly though, she&apos;s likely already got a six-figure book deal in the works.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Observer, who wrote the original story on Miss Ferrell, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227124529/http://www.observer.com/2009/media/hipster-grifter-writes-well-wisher-yes-i-have-made-mistakes?page=0">an updated article</a> that includes a note she wrote at 3 a.m. to a well-wisher.</p>
