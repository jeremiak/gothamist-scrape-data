<p>Not long ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065556/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/the_real_world_zuccotti_park.php">MTV put out word</a> that they were looking to cast Occupy Wall Street protesters for the new <em>Real World</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065556/http://www.bmpcasting.com/casting/realworld/">they&apos;re still looking</a>!). At the time, a rep for the company confirmed with us that it was indeed their Craigslist ad, and they were &quot;targeting young passionate people&quot; for their 27th season (a location has yet to be determined). While they comb through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065556/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/there_arent_that_many_hot_chicks_oc.php">Zuccotti Hotties</a>, they&apos;ve slapped together an episode of <em>True Life: I&apos;m Occupying Wall Street</em> (we would have gone with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065556/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/24/protesters_having_sex_losing_virgin.php"><em>True Life: I Lost My Virginity At Zuccotti Park</em></a>, but there&apos;s still time for that), which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065556/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1673057/occupy-wall-street-true-life.jhtml">will air November 5th</a>.</p>

<p>The protagonist: Bryan, a 20-something male that is &#x201C;one of the leaders of the Occupy sanitation team.&quot; You can meet him in this below video:</p>

<p>Do you think seeing the OWS movement through an MTV-tinted lens is a little... weird, though? [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065556/http://twitter.com/#!/brianstelter/statuses/128496254551465986">Brian Stelter</a>]</p>
