<p>Following the success of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160330/http://www.amazon.com/Want-My-MTV-Uncensored-Revolution/dp/0525952306">this uncensored history of the network</a>, four of the original MTV veejays&#x2014;Martha Quinn, Alan Hunter, Mark Goodman and Nina Blackwood&#x2014;are coming back together to give their <em>own</em> uncensored accounts of MTV in the early days. You know, the days when the &quot;M&quot; actually stood for &quot;music&quot; and not &quot;more reality television.&quot; Last year we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160330/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/06/your_first_mtv_veejays_where_are_th.php#photo-1">checked in on</a> the four pioneers as the network turned 30 years old, and even talked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160330/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/28/mark_goodman_mtvs_original_veejay.php">to Goodman</a>, who told us the VJs and much of the crew are still friends to this day.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160330/http://www.80svjs.com/?p=360">the press release</a> announcing their upcoming foray in print, this will be the first time the foursome &quot;give their uncensored accounts from the front lines of the cultural revolution that was MTV. Among the highlights will be never-before-told stories about getting, doing, and ultimately leaving the most coveted job of the decade.&quot; They also promise to unveil &quot;the truth behind Roger Daltrey&#x2019;s demands to visit MTV.&quot; Intriguing! </p>

<p>Of course, none of this will actually make MTV good again. But at least there&apos;s YouTube:</p>
