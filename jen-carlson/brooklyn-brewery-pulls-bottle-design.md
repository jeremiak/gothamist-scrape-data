Who, apparently, you do NOT mess with. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811085727/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/a-trademark-dispute-brewed-in-a-bottle/">CityRoom</a> reports that BB owner Steve Hindy started making a refermented ale called Brooklyn Local 1, which borrowed a method from the monks. But the problem was in the design of the bottle he used for it: &quot;an amber bottle design featuring a double embossed ring at the base of the neck. It was not unlike the single-ringed bottle used by the Westmalle Abbey in Belgium and by the New Belgium Brewing Company of Fort Collins, Colo.&quot; First his friend Kim Jordan, owner of the New Belgium, warned him of her &quot;protracted negotiations with the monks of Westmalle on the use of a ringed bottle in the United States...She told him it was her duty under the partnership to defend the trademark.&quot; Hindy soon backed down, took a loss of $60K and noted of the monks: &#x201C;God is on their side.&quot; However, it looks like the press images that got out there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811085727/http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/45/35328">still include the old design</a>. <em>Developing...</em> like dark clouds of a wrathful God.</p>
