<p>Last night an enraged tipster emailed us the above photo, noting it was taken on the Manhattan bound L train during rush hour. What you<em> can&apos;t</em> see here is the self-important expressions on their faces, which we blurred out. But you <em>can</em> see that they&apos;re clearly violating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230185606/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">Subway Law</a>.</p>

<p>This laid back, relaxed, can&apos;t be bothered, <em>bags on the seat</em> move is used simply to deter people from even thinking about sitting next to them. It&apos;s the worst, least original, passive-aggressive way to hog a seat (at least try the &quot;cough tactic&quot; where you show signs of sickness as someone approaches the seat next to you&#x2014;challenge yourself, be a little original!). So even if the train wasn&apos;t overflowing (though at least one person is seen standing) it&apos;s just a dick move. If you don&apos;t want to be near people on your way to pick up a hot new pair of capri trousers or whatever, then take a cab or ride a bike. Otherwise, make room for your fellow New Yorkers, maybe one of them can even lend you a pair of socks.</p>

<p>Still, all that said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230185606/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/is_this_the_most_horrifying_subway.php">coulda been worse</a>.</p>
