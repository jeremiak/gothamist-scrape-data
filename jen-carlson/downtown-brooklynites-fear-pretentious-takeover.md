One small business owner said, &quot;Eventually there&apos;ll be no small stores left. They&apos;re making it harder and harder to operate a business.&quot; And about that Barneys moving in? One local said, &quot;When I think Barneys, I think of SoHo and Chelsea and all that pretension. That&apos;s one of the things I like about living in Brooklyn, it&apos;s not pretentious.&quot; Yet!</p>
