<p>It&apos;s sort of cruel that National Donut Day comes during swimsuit season, but if we must celebrate deep fried dough in June, then so be it. And on that note: Happy National Donut Day! Might we suggest you head over to Dunkin&apos; Donuts or Krispy Kreme for a free glazed treat? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135740/http://blogs.forbes.com/markpasetsky/2011/06/03/dunkin-donuts-vs-krispy-kreme-its-war-on-national-donut-day/">Both chains</a> are giving away free donuts&#x2014;at the former, you have to buy a beverage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135740/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=152886148115472">get your donut</a>, but at the latter they&apos;re just handing them out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135740/http://www.facebook.com/KrispyKreme/posts/10150279386201001">to anyone</a>!</p>

<p>As far as &quot;food holidays&quot; go, this one has some history&#x2014;the first was celebrated by the Salvation Army in 1938 to honor the women who served donuts to soldiers during World War I. Since then, it&apos;s been observed every first Friday of June. And yet establishments like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135740/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/04/happy_national_donut_day_get_free_d.php">The Doughnut Plant and Peter Pan Donuts</a> still refuse to celebrate the day by giving us free goods... so maybe we&apos;ll just make our own.

</li><li>2 C sugar<br>
</li><li>5 tsp. baking powder<br>
</li><li>1 &#x2018;saltspoon&#x2019; salt<br>
</li><li>2 eggs<br>
</li><li>1 3/4 C milk<br>
</li><li>1 Tub lard</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Combine all ingredients (except for lard) to make dough.<br>
</li><li>Thoroughly knead dough, roll smooth, and cut into rings that are less than 1/4 inch thick. (When finding items to cut out doughnut circles, be creative! Salvation Army doughnut girls used whatever they could find, from baking powder cans to coffee percolator tubes.)<br>
</li><li>Drop the rings into the lard, making sure the fat is hot enough to brown the doughnuts gradually. Turn the doughnuts slowly several times.<br>
</li><li>When browned, remove doughnuts and allow excess fat to drip off.<br>
</li><li>Dust with powdered sugar. Let cool and enjoy.</li></ul><p></p>
