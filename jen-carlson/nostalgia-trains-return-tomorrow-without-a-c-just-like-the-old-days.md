<span class="photo_caption">An old R1-9 car (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407001947/http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/theymovedthemillions4.html">via</a>)</span></p>

<p>You can&apos;t blame the MTA for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407001947/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/where_the_f_is_the_ac_on_the_c_trai.php">no air conditioning on the subway cars</a> if they&apos;re simply trying to deliver you an authentic experience! The agency brings the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407001947/http://gothamist.com/tags/nostalgiatrain">Nostalgia Train</a> back tomorrow morning, inviting you to join them &quot;on the ever popular boardwalk-bound Coney Island Nostalgia Train, riding the R1-9 cars of the Independent Subway System... it&#x2019;s &apos;All Aboard&apos; for a scenic (above and below ground) two-hour ride to Coney Island.&quot; </p>

<p>The trains don&apos;t have air conditioning (only ceiling paddle fans), and the high is supposed to be around 98&#xB0; tomorrow&#x2014;so at least bring your bathing suit so you can jump into the ocean once you deboard. And here are some ways you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407001947/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/21/ways_to_beat_the_heat_on_the_hot_su.php">keep cool</a> underground.</p>

<p>The moving <strike>sauna</strike> historic experience will cost you $50 if you&apos;re an adult, and $20 for children (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407001947/http://www.mta.info/mta/museum/programs.htm">you will also get</a> exclusive access to the exhibits and store at the Transit Museum)&#x2014;and there&apos;s another one coming up in August that&apos;ll bring you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407001947/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/your_guide_to_rockaway_beach_this_s.php#photo-1">the Rockaways</a>.</p>
