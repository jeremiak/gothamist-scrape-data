Turns out New York&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064211/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/06/video_of_the_da_125.php">Subway Cyrano</a>, Patrick Moberg, has found his lady love. Or rather, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064211/http://www.blackbookmag.com/features/comments/patrick-mobergs-crush-is-blackbooks-intern/">Blackbook outed her</a> as one of their very own interns. Patrick apparently got a tip from a friend of hers prior to that, and updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064211/http://www.nygirlofmydreams.com/">his website</a> with a big &apos;ol &quot;FOUND HER!&quot; illustration.</p>

<p>A little about the girl: she&apos;s an Aussie, her apartment burned down a few days ago, and she&apos;s currently on the <em>Sex and the City</em> movie set as an extra. Guess she can play herself when this hits the big screen. Her name hasn&apos;t been revealed, so for now we&apos;ll just call them Patraussie, because let&apos;s face it -- combined couple names were made for these two.</p>

<p>Patraussie are talking, but only to each other -- Moberg says that the rest of the world will have to come up with their own ending to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064211/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/05/awww.php">this story</a> while they figure out if it&apos;s love, or just well-positioned hair flowers that made him so attracted to her. </p>
