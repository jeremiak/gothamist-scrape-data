<p>On September 17th &quot;THE INTREPID WILL ROCK LIKE NEVER BEFORE!&quot; Or at least since its day as a World War II aircraft carrier? Either way, It&apos;s an ALL CAPS event! According to the press release we received, the night will have a strong focus on music, and include some of &quot;today&apos;s top recording artists&quot; coming together for an unprecedented concert event. </p>

<p>We were totally picturing some sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522110147/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEszTzdUMcY">Cher type thing</a> happening here, but after some digging we learned that <strong>potential acts</strong> include The National, The Strokes, Foo Fighters, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, with openers that could include Yelle, Twin Shadow, and Delorean. Yeah, count us <em>in</em>.</p>

<p>Also, we&apos;re hearing mumblings about custom dog tag VIP passes! And, of course, fireworks.</p>
