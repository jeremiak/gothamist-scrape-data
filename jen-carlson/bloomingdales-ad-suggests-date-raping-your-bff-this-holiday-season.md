<p>&quot;Spike your best friend&#x2019;s eggnog when they&#x2019;re not looking,&quot; is the actual text on a real advertisement from Bloomingdale&apos;s. Do you know who spikes their friend&apos;s eggnog when they&apos;re not looking? Rapists.</p>

<p>After being called out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155939/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bloomingdales?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">on Twitter</a> and by various outlets yesterday, a rep for the department store told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155939/http://www.techinsider.io/bloomingdales-holiday-catalog-ad-2015-11">Tech Insider</a>: &#x201C;In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our recent catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste. Bloomingdale&#x2019;s sincerely apologizes for this error in judgment.&quot;</p>

<p>Unclear if they will issue an apology to Robin Thicke, whose &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; likeness seems to have been used in this campaign... but, you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313155939/http://jezebel.com/yikes-blurred-lines-lyrics-arent-so-catchy-when-rap-1335658624">that song was also rapey</a>.</p>

<p>We reached out to Bloomingdale&apos;s and they have told us they have &quot;no further statement at this time,&quot; and would not comment on where this ad ran or if it will continue to run.</p>
