                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="princewinery.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006163144im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/princewinery.jpg" width="640" height="426" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>You can still buy tickets to the New Power Generation shows at City Winery, for the August 21st (two shows), 22nd (two shows), 23rd (late show), and 25th (late show). But the big question is: which one will Price show up to... if any, but c&apos;mon, he is, right? The run ends on the same night the VMAs take place in Brooklyn, so it would be crazy if he were in town for that (he has been touring with his band 3rdeyegirl, after all).</p>

<p>The band&#x2014;featuring Shelby J., Liv Warfield and NPG Hornz and an 11-piece horn section&#x2014;promise that each performance will be the experience of a lifetime, and each show will feature a different celebrity guest performance. And the press release notes that &quot;even Prince has been known to grace the stage in support of his acclaimed band, so plan to expect the unexpected at each show!&quot;</p>

<p>There are still standing room tickets left for each show, which are $75 every night except for the last night, when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006163144/http://www.citywinery.com/newyork/video-music-awards-after-party-featuring-new-power-generation-vocalists-shelby-j-and-liv-warfield-and-the-npg-hornz-w-special-surprise-guests-late-8-25.html">skyrocket up to $200</a>. So, that may be telling. That one doesn&apos;t start until midnight, and is billed as a VMA after party.</p>

<p>It&apos;ll be like this but with more cheese and wine: </p>

<p>Just don&apos;t expect to see any videos of the performance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006163144/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045247/radiohead-to-prince-unblock-creep-youtube-vids">on YouTube</a> the next day.</p>
