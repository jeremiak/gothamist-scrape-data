<p>For the past few months this pink elephant has been living in DUMBO&#x2014;specifically, in the archway under the Manhattan Bridge. For some reason the elephant is getting evicted from its home, and needs a new one&#x2014;this is where YOU come in. Do you want a pink elephant? We do... but our boss says it&apos;s probably filled with rats. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152202/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/zip/4368824871.html">the Craigslist posting</a>: &quot;If you can get this wooden sculpture yourself, it&apos;s free to keep! It&apos;d be sad to see our pink friend go out a different way. Elephant is approximately 13.5 ft long, 6.5 ft high, and 4.5 ft wide and very heavy. Removal will require a pallet jack or similar equipment. Reply to this post if you are interested in taking a piece of DUMBO. <br>
(Plus, wouldn&apos;t it be cool to take this elephant out on a joy ride all the way home?)&quot; And then turn it into a bong!</p>

<p>Anyway, if no one takes it, we recommend a viking funeral on the East River.</p>
