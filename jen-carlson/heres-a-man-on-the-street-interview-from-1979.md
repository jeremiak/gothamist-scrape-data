<p>This video, recently uploaded to YouTube, was filmed around the streets of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171312/http://gothamist.com/tags/1979">NYC in 1979</a>. The filmmaker who uploaded it explains, &quot;I found this collection of outtakes in my archive. I shot these interviews on the streets of New York in the late 70s when I was doing a documentary on the coming of the information age.&quot; </p>

<p>Many of the New Yorkers filmed were given keywords to react to: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027171312/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/video_wall_street_was_occupied_in_1.php">corporations</a> (&quot;they&apos;re devious,&quot; one man declared), bureaucracy, government, instant communication (&quot;telephone,&quot; was one response), and computer. &quot;Computer? Uh...,&quot; one man paused, &quot;I&apos;m not really understanding this so you better cancel it.&quot;</p>
