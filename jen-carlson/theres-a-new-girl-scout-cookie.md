<p>It&apos;s just about Girl Scout Cookie season again, and as always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090647/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/your_guide_to_getting_girl_scout_co.php">we&apos;ll have a list</a> about how to procure the treats in New York City (after all, not <em>all</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090647/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/christian_girl_scout_troops_horrifi.php">Girl Scouts are evil</a>... probably). But first, a big announcement: there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090647/http://www.girlscoutcookies.org/">NEW COOKIE</a> this year. </p>

<p>To celebrate their 100th anniversary, they&apos;re introducing the Savannah Smiles cookie, named for the hometown of Girl Scouts founder Juliette Gordon. They don&apos;t look like much, but their description doesn&apos;t sound half bad&#x2014;they&apos;re a bite-sized, lemon wedge with a fine powdered sugar dusting.</p>

<p>Not that we don&apos;t appreciate it, but do we really need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090647/http://blog.girlscouts.org/2009/12/focus-on-cookies-lemonades.html">another lemon cookie</a>? And why don&apos;t the Girl Scouts have any chocolate-based cookies?</p>
