<p>After a week of hearing all about these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425234625/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/26/exhibitionists_are_standard_at_hote.php">exhibitionists at the Standard Hotel</a>, someone has <em>finally</em> sent us an image. See a much larger version <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425234625/http://www.flickr.com/photos/swatt/3622496713/sizes/o/">here</a>, and try to guess what&apos;s actually happening in this hotel room. Or don&apos;t. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425234625/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2009/08/naked-city.html">Vanishing NY</a> points out, city living has always offered glimpses into stranger&apos;s lives; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425234625/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/02/everyones_a_voy.php">two years ago</a> HBO projected this on the side of a LES building, and before that we had films like <em>Rear Window</em>. The site points out that the Standard&apos;s management has created the dullest version of a voyeuristic experience, and &quot;In his direction, the luxury hotelier lacks the depth and nuance of Hitchcock.&quot; It&apos;s true, but what does one expect from Andr&#xE9; Balazs? Maybe the residents at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425234625/http://gothamist.com/tags/hotelchelsea">Hotel Chelsea</a> should create an artier version of this.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425234625/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">keep those photos comin&apos;</a>!</p>
