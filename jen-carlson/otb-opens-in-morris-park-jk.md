On June 19th the Community Board&apos;s district manager, John Fratta, began receiving many angry phone calls from locals, after which he called the OTB offices to ask if they were opening a storefront in the neighborhood. They didn&apos;t know anything about it. By Monday, the confused community got some clarity when &#x201C;We found out it was a movie, but they forgot to notify the neighborhood. The phone hasn&#x2019;t stopped ringing. The outcry was unbelievable.&#x201D; Bronx native Nick Sandow is filming his movie <em>Ponies</em> in the area, so take a deep breath Morris Parkers, we&apos;d wager that everything will be okay. And OTB, don&apos;t get any ideas, Senator Jeff Klein says, &#x201C;It is incumbent on all of us to ensure new establishments speak to the community before opening their doors&quot;&#x2014;and from the sound of it, the natives don&apos;t fancy you too much.</p>
