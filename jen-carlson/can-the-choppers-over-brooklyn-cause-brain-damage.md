The tourist choppers that are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619031702/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/09/hell_no_residents_lawmakers_protest.php">sonically torturing</a> them are all coming from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619031702/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/16/33_16_ac_choppers.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> is fueling the fire by reporting that the noise could cause brain damage.</p>

<p>A noise expert told them that chopper sounds, or any constant white noise, can cause brain damage and heart attacks; he noted, &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you feel like, &#x2018;I can tough this out&#x2019;&#x2014;your body doesn&#x2019;t know that.&#x201D;</p>

<p>One resident told them, &#x201C;You can often see four or five helicopters in the air, and another five or six idling on the [Manhattan] pad. The helicopters zoom right overhead like a scene out of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>.&#x201D; Now the locals, along with Councilman Steve Levin (D-Williamsburg) and state Sen. Daniel Squadron (D-Brooklyn Heights), are rallying and urging the city to institute quiet hours.</p>
