<p>Seems like just yesterday that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507063226/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/16/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about.php">we were trying to decipher</a> the difference between the three Jeff Buckley movies being made, but that was almost <em>two years ago</em>! And <em>Greetings From Tim Buckley</em> made it to the big screen first. The film opens in NYC theaters today, and in celebration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507063226/http://gothamist.com/tags/pennbadgley">Penn Badgely</a> (who, even though we sort of hate to admit it, portrays the late singer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507063226/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/hear_penn_badgley_covering_jeff_buc.php">almost perfectly</a>) will be in attendance for a Q&amp;A; at most screenings at City Cinemas Village East this weekend. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507063226/http://tribecafilm.com/tribecafilm/blogs/penn-badgely-live-nyc-buckley">TFF announces</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;<em>Greetings From Tim Buckley</em> opens in New York City and Los Angeles today, with appearances by star Penn Badgely at tonight&apos;s and tomorrow night&apos;s NYC showings at City Cinemas Village East. A few tickets are still available to these shows (7pm and 9:50pm on Friday and Saturday), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507063226/http://www.fandango.com/citycinemasvillageeast_aaecf/theaterpage?date=5/3/2013">so grab &apos;em</a>!&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Just don&apos;t call out for &quot;Hallelujah&quot; because that&apos;s probably like his &quot;Free Bird.&quot;</p>
