</div></div>					<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164758/http://gothamist.com/tags/fashionweek">Fashion Week</a> tents preparing to come down in Bryant Park, another form of art is getting ready to take over the outdoor space. A public photography exhibition will be unveiled on April 2nd, prior to the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, and will include 120 massive aerial photographs by Yann Arthus-Bertrand.<br>
 <br>
The organizers of the event have sent us over a little sneak peek of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164758/http://www.earthfromaboveusa.org/">Earth From Above</a> exhibit&#x2014;which sort of looks like a way more colorful and vivid version of Google Earth, capturing the surface of our planet in &quot;astonishing, unexpected and often abstract ways.&quot; The installation will also be educational, with each photo accompanied by captions that link the image to the environmental and social issues at stake, &quot;inviting the onlooker to consider sustainable development as the solution to the challenges brought into focus.&quot;</p>
