</div></div>					<p>Tourists were coming to New York City long before the late-1970s I Love NY campaign rolled out. And long before the fanny pack was invented. And even long before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401121240/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/the_1920s_guide_to_nyc_etiquette.php">the 1920s tourist etiquette manual</a> was published. Click through for a look at the New York City tourists of yesteryear&#x2014;from the Rubberneck Era to the 1970s. Did you <em>know</em> that the term &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401121240/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubbernecking#Etymology">rubbernecking</a>&quot; was coined in the 1890s to refer to tourists? It was &quot;used to describe the wagons, automobiles and buses used in tours around American cities&quot;&#x2014;one writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401121240/http://books.google.com/books?id=j41z0yeKbeIC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rubbernecking&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=rubbernecking&amp;f=false">described the out-of-towners</a> &quot;stretching their necks to see New York while having misinformation shouted at them.&quot; Below, some NY Times articles regarding tourism in New York in 1910, and the 1930s:</p>

<p>In 1910, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401121240/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70F10F834591B728DDDAE0994DF405B808DF1D3">the NY Times reported</a> that tourists sure were &quot;amazed by many things, including the big noises, the slums, millionaires, policeman, and publishers.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="NYTIMESLOVETOURISTS.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401121240im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/NYTIMESLOVETOURISTS.jpg" width="640" height="337" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In 1936, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401121240/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40F12FD3D59167B93C6A8178DD85F428385F9">the NY Times</a> reported that NYC was still luring in tourists, noting: &quot;Although the tourist trade in New York retains its huge volume, the nature of the tourists themselves has undergone a decided change. In the past few years the last vestige of that naivete which formerly caused out-of-towners to be classified as &apos;rubbernecks&apos; has disappeared.&quot;</p>
