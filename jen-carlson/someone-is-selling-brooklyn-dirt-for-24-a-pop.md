<p>First of all, if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192411/http://www.bottledbrooklyn.com/">this guy</a> really wanted to capture Brooklyn he would have pickled this dirt and canned it. Secondly it is a terrible idea that will definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192411/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/nyc_trash.php">turn a profit</a>. This isn&apos;t Connecticut dirt we&apos;re talking about, it&apos;s Brooklyn dirt, and people really love the Brooklyn brand, especially people standing atop boring suburban dirt that always talks about moving to New York but never actually does it. Dig your toes into this rich Kings County soil and just consider all the famous or ironic (<em>or both!</em>) people who may have kicked it around once.</p>

<p>Anyway, some 28-year-old resident of Williamsburg is selling Brooklyn dirt for $24 per test-tube and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192411/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/selling-pieces-of-brooklyn-but-not-the-bridge/">the NY Times</a> wrote about it.</p>
