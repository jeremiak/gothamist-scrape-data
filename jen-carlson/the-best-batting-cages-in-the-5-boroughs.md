title: The Best Batting Cages In The 5 Boroughs
---

	
										<p>On a recent drive through Long Island I stopped at some batting cages to test out my skills (which had not been tested since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://deadspin.com/5821391/meat-loaf-was-my-softball-coach">Meat Loaf was my softball coach</a> <em>decades ago</em>). My traveling companion was shocked, declaring, &quot;You&apos;re a contact hitter!&quot; and that&apos;s all it took to get bit by the baseball bug again. The only problem: where can you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riNIjE-J4NQ">sock a few dingers</a> in New York City without paying <em>$90 an hour</em> (ahem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://www.chelseapiers.com/fh/drop-in/batting-cages.cfm">Chelsea Piers</a>)? I did some research (and please, add your suggestions in the comments!).</p>

<p><strong>RANDALL&apos;S ISLAND GOLF CENTER</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="randallsbatting.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/randallsbatting.jpg" width="640" height="430" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>This place seems to be the way to go. It&apos;s <em>outdoors</em> (a huge plus), and the rates are fairly reasonable in comparison to others. You get 30 pitches per token ($3.50), or you can rent the cage for $40 for 30 minutes, or $60 for an hour. But take note: bring batting gloves, because these pitches are fast and <em>will</em> hurt your hands. (You could also just choose the slow-pitch softball setting.)</p>

<p>Bonus: They don&apos;t just have batting cages here, there&apos;s also mini golf, a driving range, <em>and</em> a beer garden.</p>

<p>Here you&apos;ll get some pretty solid batting cages, albeit indoor ones (but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://ascsports1.com/batting-cages/">they make it look like</a> you&apos;re on a field!). The rates are less than Randall&apos;s Island, for baseball/softball/curveball pitches (speeds range from 40 to 95 MPH), you&apos;ll pay $15 for 15 minutes, $25 for 30 minutes, and $45 for 60 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>THE BASEBALL CENTER</strong></p>

<p>If you&apos;ve got a real love of the game, head to the Baseball Center on the Upper West Side, where you won&apos;t get distracted by arcade games or beer gardens like at the other places. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://www.villagevoice.com/bestof/2012/award/best-batting-cages-3764513/">Village Voice</a> named this one the Best Batting Cage in the city, noting, &quot;the 15,000-square-foot training center that has something to offer everyone, from youngsters looking to get an edge up on their Little League opponents to old-timers looking to hit some balls and remember the glory days.&quot; And their pitches can hit up to 100 MPH! Note: looks like you&apos;ll have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/https://www.thebaseballcenter.com/batting-cage-rentals/">rent your cage</a> ahead of time.</p>

<p><em>202 West 74th Street // 212.362.0344 // <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/https://www.thebaseballcenter.com/">www.thebaseballcenter.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>STATEN ISLAND GO KARTS &amp; MINI GOLF</strong><br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="sicages0713.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/sicages0713.jpg" width="640" height="410" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Don&apos;t be fooled, on top of their go karts and mini golf, this place also has nice outdoor batting cages, including one &quot;lob pitch&quot; machine for those intimidated by a little speed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://www.sigokarts.com/id6.html">For $2.50 you&apos;ll get 18 pitches</a>&#x2014;not the best deal in town, but you&apos;ll get to hit those balls while breathing in the fresh SI air.</p>

<p>Located right by City Island (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://gothamist.com/tags/cityisland">here are our guides</a> if you want to make a day of it) the Turtle Cove Golf Center has a great new batting cage area, with both softball and baseball pitching machines. </p>

<p>It&apos;ll cost you $3 per token (which gets you 25 pitches), but if you buy 5 tokens for $15 you get a 6th free. Otherwise, it&apos;s $40 for 30 minutes, and $60 for an hour. </p>

<p><strong>BROOKLYN SPORTS AND PARTY CENTER</strong><br>

<p>The batting cages in particular have pretty good reviews on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120609/http://www.yelp.com/biz/3rd-avenue-sports-center-brooklyn">their Yelp page</a>, so even if the place isn&apos;t outdoors or as nice looking as you may want it to be, it&apos;s a solid place to get some hits in. The speeds range from 30 to 80 MPH, and rates are fairly reasonable. $25 for 30 minutes, and $45 to hit some dingers for an hour (those both go up $10 on weekends). </p>
