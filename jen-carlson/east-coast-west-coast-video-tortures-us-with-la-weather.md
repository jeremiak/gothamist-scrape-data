<p>If you blink your eyes over and over again with perfect timing while watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820001412/https://vimeo.com/87039246">this video</a>, you can blissfully ignore the seal pups, the sunshine, the picnics in the green goddamn grass, the sea and the sand and the sundresses, the palm trees, the short sleeves, the bare feet... and continue to live in a colorless world where we are all frozen in winter with no alternatives.</p>

<p>NYC-based photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820001412/http://gothamist.com/tags/colbymoore">Colby Moore</a> was in Los Angeles last month and decided to intercut some clips of the SoCal sun out west with some soul-crushing scenes from around New York City. (Listen, LA&apos;s a nice place to visit, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820001412/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/nyc_vs_la_which_better.php">who would want to live there</a>?) He says it &quot;serves as a good portrait of a time of year when the meteorological conditions of these two massive metropolitan areas stand at complete polar opposite ends of the spectrum.&quot;</p>

<p>What time does summer start?</p>
