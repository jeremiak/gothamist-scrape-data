<p>40 years ago yesterday, the day before his 25th birthday and six years after his self-titled debut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104214134/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151171302392665&amp;set=a.424610777664.193516.30899502664&amp;type=1">RCA issued</a> their first ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104214134/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidbowie">David Bowie</a> single, featuring &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Andy Warhol.&quot;</p>

<p>Today Bowie turns 66 years old, and he&apos;s celebrating with the announcement of his first studio album in a decade, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104214134/http://www.davidbowie.com/the-next-day"><em>The Next Day</em></a>, set to be released on March 12th of this year. Along with the announcement, the Thin White Duke has released a video for &quot;Where Are We Now?,&quot; a sentimental single from the upcoming album.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104214134/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/hang-on-to-yourself-new-album-coming-from-david-bowie/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">to ArtsBeat</a>, the song was recorded in New York, and produced by his frequent and longtime collaborator Tony Visconti. Beyond the single, the press release sent out announcing the new album gave little indication to what sound or direction the musician would be going in with this one, but noted that he &#x201C;is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants... when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell. Today he definitely has something to say.&#x201D;</p>
