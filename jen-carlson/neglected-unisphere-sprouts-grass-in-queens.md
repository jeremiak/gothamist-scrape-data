<p>The Unisphere, the once shining centerpiece of the World&apos;s Fair, has been so neglected that it&apos;s begun to sprout grass through its cracks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405182916/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/08/21/2009-08-21_global_warning_grass_grows_on_unispheres_south_pole.html">The Daily News</a> pointed it out to the Parks Department, who &quot;suspect that bird droppings and leaves collected in the base of the 12-story landmark, providing the perfect conditions for germination when seeds blew in and feasted on rain water.&quot; </p>

<p>While one local joked it could be a Chia Unisphere, others were not so lighthearted about the neglect, saying, &quot;If this was in Manhattan, the Unisphere would be pristine and it&apos;d be polished every year. It&apos;s really sad.&quot; Well, it does have a sort of post-apocalyptic charm.</p>

<p>The sphere was restored and cleaned thoroughly in 1994, but has since been vandalized and built up more grime. The paper notes, however, that &quot;After the U.S. Open ends next month, the city will fence off the Unisphere fountains and fix the pumping system&quot; (which currently leaks into a nearby museum). In the meantime, here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405182916/http://images.google.com/images?q=unisphere&amp;q=source%3Alife">a few images</a> from the glory days.</p>
