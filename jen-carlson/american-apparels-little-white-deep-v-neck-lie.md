										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:279px; "> <img alt="phpfmnAdFPM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpfmnAdFPM.jpg" width="279" height="284"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Sasha Grey: real person, porn star, or both?</span></i></div> Are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245/http://gothamist.com/tags/americanapparel">American Apparel</a>&apos;s models &quot;real people&quot;? According to Jezebel, the company has long stated the scantily clad bodies you see in their ads are employees, friends of Dov Charney, and never <em>ever</em> professional models. <p></p>

<p>The site points to a 2006 Financial Times article where the company said they &quot;work exclusively with non-professional models&quot;&#x2014;something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245/http://jezebel.com/5531777/american-apparel-lies-about-its-real-people-models">Jezebel</a> is now calling out as a lie that the company perpetrated even in 2008, saying, <strong>&quot;Unlike almost everyone in the fashion industry, American Apparel doesn&apos;t use professional models and agencies.&quot;</strong> And just last month the company told Fox that their &quot;ads are evocative because they feature real people instead of professional models.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, the company <em>does</em> use models in some ads, and they&apos;ve also used porn stars (but c&apos;mon, porn stars are real people, too!). These girls at times have fake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245/http://www.americanapparel.net/gallery/photocollections/models/">bios</a> because, as the company tells us, sometimes they &quot;ask to use pseudonyms which we always agree to.&quot; Jezebel&apos;s claim is that in operating with this &quot;seductive/reductive concept&quot; the real people will flock to their stores to buy mesh bodysuits, or whatever&#x2014;which in reality, will look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245/http://www.wornjournal.com/html/american-able/">like this</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245/http://jezebel.com/341625/american-apparel-will-make-you-look-like-a-fat-hooker">this</a> on a real person.</p>

<p>American Apparel&apos;s creative director Iris Alonzo tells us, &quot;Our photographs capture their natural beauty&#x2014;which means no professional makeup artists, no stylists and no airbrushing. This way of working means we find our many muses in a variety of places. In the last year alone, I&apos;ve photographed countless employees, friends, the winning butts from our Best Bottom Contest, fashion bloggers, two teenage lovebirds we met at our Lower Broadway store during Fashion&apos;s Night Out and of course, my dog Charlie. <strong>I&apos;d say that 95% of the people we shoot have never been professionally photographed before</strong>, and approximately 50% of those people work for the company in some capacity.&quot; (Her full statement is after the jump.) So basically, sorry dudes, you aren&apos;t going to be greeted at check-out by Sasha Grey (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245/http://www.flawlesshustle.com/fashion/sasha-grey-x-american-apparel/">NSFW</a>!)... but rather a real person, who may or may not be in an ad, but definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710073245/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/27/dov_charney.php">didn&apos;t get axed</a> by Charney.</p>
