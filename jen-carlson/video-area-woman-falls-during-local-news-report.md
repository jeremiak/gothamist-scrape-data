										<p>Recently Joe Torres of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414113532/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/video?id=7814462">Eyewitness News</a> was in the Bronx reporting on Catholic church/school robberies in Bedford Park... but luckily a woman lightened things up when she fell on camera! Always, always amusing. We&apos;ve all been there lady, it was just your time.</p>
