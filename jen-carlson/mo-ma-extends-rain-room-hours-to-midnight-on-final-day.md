<p>Hey guys: You can now wait on line for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152047/http://gothamist.com/tags/rainroom">MoMA&apos;s Rain Room</a> <em>even longer</em>! We heard a rumor yesterday that they would extend the hours of the installation now that it&apos;s in its final week, and they just confirmed that with us. </p>

<p><strong>The Rain Room will remain open from 10:30 a.m. until midnight (plus a Members Only viewing opening at 8:00 a.m.) on its last day of operation, Sunday, July 28th.</strong> Hopefully the extended hours will mean a shorter wait, but also: it&apos;s a Sunday, and people have nothing to do after brunch on Sundays, so don&apos;t count on it. </p>

<p>For more on waiting on line for 8 hours to stand inside the magical room, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152047/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/rain_room.php">click here</a> and let your mind come to terms with how it&apos;s going to fall apart during said wait.</p>
