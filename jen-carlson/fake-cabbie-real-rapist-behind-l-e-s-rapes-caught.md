After two reported rapes, those heading to and from the club were on guard. Finally, now a suspect has been caught and confessed...and the ladies of New York have a Scores stripper to thank for it. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180316/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/02/18/2008-02-18_cabbie_nabbed_in_rapes_of_clubgoers.html">The Daily News reports</a> the exotic dancer was leaving work early Sunday morning when she hailed a town car which she thought was a livery cab at 10th Avenue and 29th Street.  She was sexually assaulted by the driver but managed to fight him off and take down the license plate number.  An hour later the driver picked up four women at the same intersection.  After three of the women were dropped off, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180316/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=5964116">attacked the remaining woman in the back seat</a>; the victim who also took down the plate number.  </p>

<p>When police apprehended, 28-year-old Brooklynite Torkieh Sadagheh, he confessed to &quot;assaulting the Scores dancer&quot; but denied raping the second woman.  In addition, he also admitted to &quot;abducting, robbing and raping&quot; the two women who had patronized The Box on different occasions. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180316/http://www.1010wins.com/Exotic-Dancer-Helps-Police-Nab-Serial-Rape-Suspect/1673892">Charges are expected</a> to be filed against Sadagheh later today.</p>
