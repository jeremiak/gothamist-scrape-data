										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="babelandbike0112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212114im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/babelandbike0112.jpeg" width="350" height="350"> <br> <i>Rendering</i></div> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212114/http://gothamist.com/tags/babeland">Babeland</a> outpost in Park Slope is offering up a new service for Brooklynites who don&apos;t want to get out of bed: they&apos;ll deliver sex toys to your door, and by bike! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212114/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/5/dtg_sextoydelivery_2012_02_03_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> (who just <em>happened</em> to find out about it?), the service costs a whopping 30 bucks, but it&apos;s free on Valentine&apos;s Day. <p></p>

<p>So how many people are having dildos delivered to them in bed? Pamela Doan at Babeland tells us, &quot;Per day, it isn&#x2019;t a big figure... but it&#x2019;s safe to say we do dozens every year. Part of the fun of shopping for sex toys is coming into the store and playing with all the nice gadgets, getting a sense of how they work and letting your imagination get carried away.&quot; But for those who are using the service, Doan tells us the most delivered item is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212114/http://store.babeland.com/vibrators-electric/hitachi-magic-wand">Hitachi Magic Wand</a>, &quot;which is probably the most recognizable and familiar vibrator since it&#x2019;s been around for a million years. Lube is frequently requested along with an order, but not usually ordered by itself.&quot;</p>

<p>Most deliveries are made to hotel rooms, according to their records. And if you want to try it out yourself, don&apos;t be shy, the items come in a discreet box.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Doan tells us this service is available through every store, so Manhattanites can get bedside delivery as well.</p>
