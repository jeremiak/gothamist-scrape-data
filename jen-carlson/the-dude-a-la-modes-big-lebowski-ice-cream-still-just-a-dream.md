<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408200355/http://www.buzzfeed.com/jond4/ben-jerrys-big-lebowski-ice-cream-annou-2s6r">someone</a> posted this image of &quot;Dude Food,&quot; a Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s creation honoring cult fave <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, and containing White Russian ice cream with chocolate bowling balls. And well, if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408200355/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/13/taste-testing_ben_jerrys_schweddy_b.php">Schweddy Balls</a> can happen, why can&apos;t this be? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408200355/http://cosbysweaters.com/2011/09/21/is-ben-jerrys-dude-food-real-or-fake/">Unfortunately</a>, you won&apos;t be sprawled out on your Persian rug devouring it anytime soon. </p>
