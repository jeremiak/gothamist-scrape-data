</div></div>					<p>The party&apos;s over! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003512/http://gothamist.com/tags/willsmith">Will Smith</a>&apos;s mobile mansion (called The Heat) has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003512/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/12/will_smiths_massive_trailer_evicted.php">taken off the streets</a>, and is now sitting empty in a parking lot half a mile from where <em>Men In Black III</em> is shooting on Broome Street. His personal gym, housed in a separate 55-foot trailer, is parked right next to it.  For now, Smith has been forced into a 35-foot trailer (that&apos;s a whole 18 feet smaller than The Heat), which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003512/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/13/actor-will-smith-says-goodbye-to-mega-trailer-in-soho/">reportedly</a> has features any ol&apos; commoner could get. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003512/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/his_luxe_ran_out_ybnz6lxB2z1jOsQGEe12VP#ixzz1MFBElRPG">The NY Post</a> calls it &quot;a bland, generic movie trailer,&quot; and a source on set told them, &quot;Will has to live like normal people&#x2014;at least for today. It&apos;s like going from a BMW to a Toyota.&quot; It&apos;s unclear why Smith can&apos;t just walk over to his mega-trailer, or his $25,000-a-month Bond Street apartment, which are both nearby. </p>

<p>As for Smith himself, he hasn&apos;t said anything about the situation, and allegedly &quot;scowled&quot; when confronted by press about it yesterday. And can you blame him? Click through for some photos of this thing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003512/http://www.motorhomeplanet.co.uk/archives/27">In the early aughts</a> it was reported that, for the bargain basement price of $1.8 million, Will Smith was the first to pick up a luxury motor home. He chose The Heat, made by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003512/http://www.andersonmobileestates.com/">Anderson Mobile Estates</a> (so that&apos;s not actually a term of endearment the actor gave to the motor home, rather the model he purchased). Though Smith had his customized, you can click through for some photos of what The Heat&apos;s interior looks like... as well as what his looked like back in 2004.</p>
