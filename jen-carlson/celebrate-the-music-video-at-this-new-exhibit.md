<p>Remember when music videos used to air in full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031143310/http://gothamist.com/tags/mtv">on MTV</a> and there weren&apos;t reality shows about pregnant teenagers? You can briefly return to that blissful era at the Museum of the Moving Image starting next month. &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031143310/http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2013/04/03/detail/spectacle-the-music-video/">Spectacle: The Music Video</a>&quot; is the first museum exhibition to celebrate the art and history of the music video&#x2014;with examples spanning the decades, from David Bowie to Kanye West.</p>

<blockquote>Through over 300 videos, artifacts, and interactive installations, the exhibition shows the changing landscape of the music video, highlighting its place at the forefront of creative technology, and its role in pushing the boundaries of creative production. Spectacle explores the trajectory of the music video from precursors through to the present day across a range of musical genres, and showcases the innovative work of contemporary directors such as Michel Gondry, Floria Sigismondi, and Chris Milk. Original props and artifacts from iconic music videos such as A-ha&#x2019;s groundbreaking &#x201C;Take On Me&#x201D; and OK Go&#x2019;s &#x201C;This Too Shall Pass&#x201D; are presented alongside interactive experiences featuring works by Radiohead and Bj&#xF6;rk.</blockquote> 

<p>Items on display will include the ship from Smashing Pumpkins&apos; &quot;Tonight Tonight&quot; video, OK GO&apos;s jumpsuits from &quot;This Too Shall Pass,&quot; original drawings from A-Ha&apos;s &quot;Take on Me,&quot; and much more. Public programs, screenings, hands-on workshops, and exclusive special events, as well as appearances from directors and musicians, will be held in conjunction with the exhibit, which runs from April 3rd through June 16th.</p>
