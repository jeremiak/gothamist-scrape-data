</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420003142/http://www.mta.info/mta/museum/">New York Transit Museum</a> is presenting a photo exhibit featuring images taken on the last day the Myrtle Avenue El in Brooklyn was in operation, all taken by noted photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420003142/http://www.theresakingphotography.com/">Theresa King</a>. You can revisit the past starting September 29th at the museum (running through the end of February), but here&apos;s a sneak peek and a little history. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420003142/http://www.myrtleavenue.org/">Myrtle Avenue</a> el line began running in 1888, from downtown Brooklyn to Queens, passing through Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick, Ridgewood, and Middle Village.  After eighty years, it shut down in 1969 to the dismay of many, and was demolished the following year.</p>

<p>King recalls: &#x201C;At midnight on October 3, 1969 over a thousand people eagerly awaited a train&#x2014;not just any train, but the final train to run on Brooklyn&#x2019;s Myrtle Avenue elevated line.  These people were taking the last ride on this historic elevated train.  As soon as they crammed on, the train rolled along from Brooklyn&#x2019;s Jay Street station to the Metropolitan Avenue station in Queens.  At the end of this sad journey, some passengers took artifacts to remember this very special old timer and bid a fond farewell. The pictures were taken during this last day at various stations along the Myrtle Avenue el in Brooklyn.  During my childhood, I rode this train daily and loved the look of the station stops and the train itself.  When I realized the line was due for demolition, I wanted to document a part of Brooklyn&#x2019;s past that would be no more.&#x201D;</p>
