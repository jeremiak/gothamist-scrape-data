<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132002/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/16/justin_sight_magician.php">we met up with Justin Sight</a> (real name Adam Jaslikowski)&#x2014;a blind magician (suffering from vision loss from Stargardt macular degeneration disorder) who dazzles New Yorkers underground and elsewhere. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132002/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/11/this_wizard_can_save_nyc.php">Quarters floating in thin air</a>. Markings appearing on your hand. Cards disappearing before your eyes. He&apos;s a real talent in the field, and a joy to watch. </p>

<p>And now Sebastian Mlynarski has released a 12-minute video after following the 25-year-old magician around the city&#x2014;it features a deeper look into Jaslikowski&apos;s life, which started in Poland.</p>
