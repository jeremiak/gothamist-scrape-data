                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="gagacrystal.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928015122im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gagacrystal.jpg" width="640" height="368" class="image-none"> </span><br>
<span class="photo_caption">Do you think everyone gets to spoon the crystal or just famous people?</span></p>

<p>Recently Marina Abramovic launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928015122/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/422090958/marina-abramovic-institute-the-founders">a Kickstarter</a> in hopes of raising $600,000 for her institute, which will be an &quot;interdisciplinary performance and education center [and] home to long durational work and the Abramovic Method.&quot; Which presumably involved spooning a very large crystal inside an empty, wooden room.</p>

<p>And there&apos;s no better way to draw attention to your cause then to get a big name who is willing to go topless in a video for you. Enter: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928015122/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a>. Sure, you&apos;ve probably seen her naked before, but have you seen her naked upstate, in nature... baring not just her breasts, <em>but her soul?</em></p>

<p>This video was shot last week at a 3-day retreat where &quot;Marina instructed Lady Gaga in the Abramovic Method&#x2014;a series of exercises designed to heighten participants&apos; awareness of their physical and mental experience in the present moment.&quot; </p>

<p>NSFW, etc. </p>

<p>But since inner peace like this is scary, the Abramovic Method sometimes works best while listening to &quot;Yakety Sax&quot;:</p>
