<p>Both restaurants are established, having opened in the late &apos;90s, so the trio sought a class action which would allow them to include any workers who were employed by McNally over the past six years. It&apos;s expected that more than 100 people will be involved, including current workers who will be protected by anonymity.</p><blockquote>It accused the restaurants and McNally of setting corporate-wide policies that caused workers to suffer financially, including a requirement that waiters repay the amount of a bill whenever a customer walked out without paying.<p></p>

<p>The restaurants also deducted money from a waiter&apos;s pay if his cash submitted at the end of a shift was short and took out another $5 per shift to cover the pay of the person who folds napkins on the tables, the lawsuit said.</p></blockquote>Expensive eateries screwing over employees? Shocking. Maybe frequent patron of Balthazar, Nick Denton, can get them to institute some sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151558/http://valleywag.com/339285/gawkers-new-pay-system-++-the-100+word-version">newfangled pay system</a>...but then McNally would likely end up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151558/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/17/nick_denton_fin.php">waiting the tables himself</a>.<p></p>
