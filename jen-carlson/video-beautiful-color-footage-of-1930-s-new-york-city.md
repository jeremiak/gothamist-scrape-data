---

	
										<p>We&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214245/http://gothamist.com/tags/1930s">spent some time in 1930s</a> New York City before, but always in boring, flat black &amp; white. Now you can see it all in glorious color. The below footage was filmed in the summer of 1939 by a a French tourist, Jean Vivier, on 16mm Kodachrome. You&apos;ll see Harlem, Rockefeller Center, the top of a tourist bus, and much more in the nearly 3 minutes of film.</p>
