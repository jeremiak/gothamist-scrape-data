This term is too cold and doesn&apos;t really do their sound justice. The music is more complex, doom and gloom with a little bit of hope - digital beats with a little bit of guitar rock. At times one aspect of the band overpowers the others - breaking through the sound we had just gotten used to.  With crystal clear vocals and a longing undertone, we think we&apos;ll be looking for hand to hold tonight as they play at our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120415102152/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/04/14/movable_hype_70_1.php">Movable Hype</a> show [details below]. </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate? </strong><br>
The name is adopted, like a child, you know? It is a refrence to a Belle and Sebastian Song, and we took it selfishly, because we thought we could just pick it up and run with it. There are few things you can take from someone whom you&#x2019;ve never met, without pissing them off. I think naming your band after another band&#x2019;s song is one of those things. Stars of Track and Field is our name, but the original concept isn&#x2019;t our idea, so there&#x2019;s not much more to say about it. </p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York? </strong><br>
I remember standing in Times Square on New Years Eve with thousands of people freezing our balls off waiting for the silly ball to drop. It was so fucking cold, everyone was bouncing around just to keep warm. Some cops on the subway were convinced that I was using psychedelic drugs, and they rapped with me about which is better, the purple or the pink blotter. I wish I had more memorable experiences here. We must make some memories this next week.</p>

<p><strong>If you could play at any venue here, which would it be (past, present...)?</strong><br>
We&#x2019;ve never played here. We are from Portland, and none of us have spent too much time in New York. I think Madison Square Garden would be quite fun. We should play there, I think. </p>
