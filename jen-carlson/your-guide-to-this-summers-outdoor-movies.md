title: Your Guide To This Summer's Outdoor Movies
---

	
										<p><em>On paper, going to see a movie outdoors on one of the city&apos;s patches of grass is a <em>great</em> idea. In reality, it can often get very crowded... especially with all the classic flicks screening around town this summer. Should you want to brave the crowds, click through for our outdoor movie guide (so far&#x2014;there are still places like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040356/http://www.centralpark.com/guide/activities/movies.html">Central Park</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128040356/http://www.riverflicks.com/RFgrownups.html">RiverFlicks</a> have yet to release their schedules, but we&apos;ll update this list once they do).</em></p>
