<p>The Interactive end of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161740/http://gothamist.com/tags/sxsw">SXSW</a> starts today, but can it <em>really</em> start without the all-important citizens of New York&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161740/http://www.theonion.com/articles/pretty-cute-watching-boston-residents-play-daily-g,31554/">Bostonites sure</a>, <em>but New Yorkers?</em> At press time, many are stranded in local airports as the fest somehow &quot;starts&quot; in Austin without them. And should they <em>ever even get there</em>, the weather nightmare could plague their entire trip. Editor-In-Chief of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161740/http://jezebel.com/">Jezebel</a>, Jessica Coen&#x2014;who is currently on the ground at Newark&#x2014;tells us: &quot;I have a friend who lives in Austin and said despite it being sunny 100% of the time, it&apos;s pouring right now. SXSW disaster.&quot; The rain is expected to last <em>all weekend</em>.</p>

<p>Here are some more transmissions being sent out of the area&apos;s airports, each one expressing unique-like-a-snowflake thoughts and reminding us that life is terrible, unfair:</p>
