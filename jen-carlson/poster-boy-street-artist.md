Earlier this week we tracked down the anonymous artist to ask him about his plans, ideas and why he does what he does.</em></p>

<p><strong>Do you consider yourself a street artist?</strong> Amongst other things, yes.</p>

<p><strong>Did you start with the subway ad &quot;mashups&quot; or had you been working on other canvases before?</strong> I started with hand-me-down canvases in art school. Appropriation art was the excuse I gave. Without trying to sound pathetic it all started with not having the space and money to make art the traditional way. After a while the canvas work didn&apos;t satisfy my ambitions. I felt I had a lot more to &quot;say&quot; and it was eating me inside. Then one day out of frustration and curiosity I started tearing down the ads.  </p>

<p><strong>Recently there was video of you taking down a billboard and a hint that bigger things were to come. What&apos;s next?</strong> I have something planned that, if successful, will make the poster and billboard stuff look trivial. However, the process will take a few months maybe a year or so.  For now, just advert takeovers and more collaborations. For people who&apos;re interested in PARTICIPATING please email posterboynyc2@hotmail.com</p>

<p><strong>How hard is it to take down a billboard?!</strong> Cutting them down is easy. I use the same razor in the subway. Having the nerve and competence to climb up is something entirely different.</p>

<p><strong>Have you ever been arrested?</strong> Yeah. Never for art related crimes though. What have I gotten away with? That&apos;s the real question.</p>

<p><strong>What have people said to you when they see you altering the subway ads?</strong> I get a lot of, &quot;Oh you&apos;re the guy that does the poster stuff&quot;, and, &quot;Hey, did you do anything on the such and such line?&quot; Most of the time people stare. On a good day I have Vandal Squad officers hounding me for autographs.</p>
