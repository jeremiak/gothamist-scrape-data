title: Bad Idea?: Neon Benches For Relaxing Park Atmosphere

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="neonbench.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301052149im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/neonbench.jpg" width="215" height="159" class="image-left"> </span>The &apos;80s are back! Or at least that&apos;s what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301052149/http://brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/20/cg_neonbenches_2010_05_21_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> is declaring with the neon paint that&apos;s soon to be lathered over some benches in Gowanus. This is allegedly all part of some initiative to draw attention to the oft-ignored Thomas Greene Park. </p>

<p>A chairwoman from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301052149/http://www.friendsofdouglassgreenepark.org/">Friends of Douglass/Greene Park</a> told the paper, &#x201C;No one knew this park existed. We wanted to do something bright and cheery to get people to think of us. We had these very dull benches and we figured it&#x2019;s a good time to do something fun to enliven them.&quot; So now 32 benches will be painted vivid shades of pink, green and orange.&#x201D; Sounds... relaxing.</p>

<p>The standard green benches may make a comeback eventually, however. The Parks Department approved the neon colors, but only temporarily until a full park rehab begins next year.</p>
