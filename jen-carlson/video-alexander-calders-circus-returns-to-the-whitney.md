<p>Alexander Calder&apos;s Circus is setting up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172913/http://whitney.org/Collection/AlexanderCalder/8336195">the Whitney</a> once again (it&apos;s part of their permanent collection, and was last up in 2009), and will be reinstalled at the museum on December 9th. A little background for those who haven&apos;t immersed themselves in Calder&apos;s wonderworld yet:</p><blockquote>While living in Paris, from 1926 to 1931, Calder created his Circus out of the humblest of materials, including wire, cork, fabric, and string: a collection of tiny figures that walk tightropes, dance, lift weights, swallow swords, and execute a remarkable range of acrobatics in the ring. In addition to the human entertainers, the circus is populated by a veritable menagerie, including dogs and ponies, a lion, a camel, and a musical bear. For many years, Calder transported his miniature Circus between Paris and the United States, giving performances that became legendary.</blockquote>The Whitney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172913/http://whitney.org/Collection/AlexanderCalder">has 187 Calder works</a> in their permanent collection, and will also have some of his other pieces on view. And here is Calder performing his Circus, from a 1955 film by Jean Painleve:<p></p>
