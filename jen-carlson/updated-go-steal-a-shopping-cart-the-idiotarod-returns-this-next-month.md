<p>Every year around this time we get an email from the people running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160347/http://gothamist.com/tags/idiotarod">the annual Idiotarod race</a>, which tells us that Corporation X (the organizers) are no longer involved, and have handed off the company to [insert ridiculous name here]. This year, we are being told that Corporation X has gone into fiscal receivership and the Idiotarod &quot;was acquired by Lord R. McGeddon, who has &quot;a long family history in the military, pharmaceutical, and agro-chemical industries.&quot;</p>

<p>Whether or not it&apos;s actually being run by new people this year, the race will be pretty much the same, though there seems to be a 2012 &quot;world is ending&quot; vibe about it all. They tell us, &quot;The race will be won by the worthy.  Harsher judgment than usual? Yes.  Why?  Because it is The Judgment. Trying to earn your way through the Pearly Gates will require bribery and trickery of the highest order.  Proper pronation and submission and devotion to Clan McGeddon, various Minions, and Sundry Agents is not just strongly encouraged, but required.&quot; This year&apos;s theme: Armageddon.</p>

<p>Cart Rapture begins January 28th, but let&apos;s be adults about this&#x2014;organizers ask that you refrain from hurling food and other objects at competitors. Instead, focus on trying to be better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160347/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/29/video_idiotarod_psa.php">Team Danger Zone</a>, who no one has topped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160347/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/28/video_of_the_da_156.php">since 2008</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It seems a new group wants to hijack the event from Corporation X, who say they&apos;re still around, and the REAL Idiotarod will be happening on February 4th, with a start line at Zuccotti Park... which sounds like a terrible idea! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131160347/http://www.nycidiotarod2012.com/">More details here</a> on that one, and we&apos;ll update when we&apos;re eventually told this is a scam, too.</p>
