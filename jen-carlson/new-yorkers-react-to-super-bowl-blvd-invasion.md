title: New Yorkers React To Super Bowl Blvd Invasion
---

	
										<p>Super Bowl Blvd won&apos;t officially open until tomorrow, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020549/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/12/times_square_will_be_under_lockdown.php">week-long closure of Broadway</a> (between West 34th and West 47th Streets) started on Sunday. And many people <em>claiming to be</em> New Yorkers on social media platforms actually seem to be enjoying it&#x2014;there&apos;s a toboggan! It&apos;s really winning people over. Last week you had to go to Times Square every day for work and there was no toboggan. This week you have to go to Times Square every day for work and there&apos;s a toboggan slide. </p>

<p>Still... there are some who are on the other side of the feelings spectrum about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020549/http://www.nycgo.com/articles/super-bowl-boulevard">Super Bowl Blvd</a>, like Mr. New Yorker over heeah:<br>
