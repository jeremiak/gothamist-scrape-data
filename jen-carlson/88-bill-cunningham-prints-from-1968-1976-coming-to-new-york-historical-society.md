</div></div>					<p>In 1968 beloved New York photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205811/http://gothamist.com/tags/billcunningham">Bill Cunningham</a> embarked on a project that would span eight years, lasting through 1976. During that time he captured the city&apos;s architecture and fashion history, placing models in period costumes in front of New York&apos;s buildings, bridges, and even the subway system. The images are timeless, and will be headed for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205811/http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/bill-cunningham-facades">New York Historical Society</a> in March 2014.</p>

<p>The exhibition, Fa&#xE7;ades, delves a little deeper than the beautiful surface of these things, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205811/http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/bill-cunningham-facades">the museum notes</a> that the project &quot;was part of the larger cultural zeitgeist in New York City, during an era in which issues surrounding both the preservation and the problems of the urban landscape loomed large.&quot;</p>

<p>The show will feature 88 prints from the series, donated to the NYHS by Cunningham, and will run through June 15th, 2014.</p>

<p>And if you somehow don&apos;t know about the NY Times photographer, often seen biking around in his blue jacket, check the documentary out: </p>
