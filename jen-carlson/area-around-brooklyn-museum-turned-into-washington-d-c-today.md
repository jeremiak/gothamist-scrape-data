<span class="photo_caption">The Brooklyn Museum on a normal day. (Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051449/http://www.flickr.com/photos/46871223@N00/4892412103/">thelexiphane&apos;s flickr</a>)</span></p>

<p>That new James Spader show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051449/http://www.nbc.com/the-blacklist/"><em>The Blacklist</em></a> (that we really didn&apos;t think we&apos;d be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051449/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/05/the_aviation_cocktail.php">writing about again</a> so soon) is filming in Brooklyn today. Big deal, right? But they&apos;ve turned the area around the Brooklyn Museum <em>into Washington D.C.</em>.</p>

<p>There will be some simulated police, ambulance and fire department activity in the Museum&apos;s main driveway to recreate a Hazmat disaster, so don&apos;t be alarmed. But <em>do</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051449/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us</a> your photos and video of the scene. <b>Update</b>: Here are some pictures!</p>

<p>However, DCist&apos;s Matt Cohen point out that this is an inaccurate rendering of the Metro&apos;s Red Line station sign at Tenleytown&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051449/http://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tenleytown-au-metro-station-kevin-patrick.jpg?w=300">it looks more like this</a>.</p>

<p>The show (which recently reintroduced us to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051449/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/05/the_aviation_cocktail.php">the Aviation cocktail</a>) follows former government agent Raymond &quot;Red&quot; Reddington (Spader) who &quot;surrenders to the FBI with an offer to help catch a terrorist under the condition that he speaks only to Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone), a young FBI profiler.&quot;</p>
