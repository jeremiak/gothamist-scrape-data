</div></div>					<p>Raise your hand if you saw a rainbow after work last night! Seems a lot of people caught this one, which looks to have been in view from practically anywhere in the city (even on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423194611/http://www.flickr.com/photos/askrom/2757931127">Water Taxi ride to Red Hook</a>). Although it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423194611/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/04/palazzo_chupi.php">didn&apos;t originate</a> from the very essence of Julian Schnabel&apos;s soul this time around, they can&apos;t <em>all</em> be art stars. Here are some shots readers sent in from around town.</p>
