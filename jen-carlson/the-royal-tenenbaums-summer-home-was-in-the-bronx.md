<p>Did you know that the Tenenbaum family summered in the Bronx? Their home on Eagle&apos;s Island was, in real life, at 21 Tier Street on City Island. That&apos;s right, just about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122357/http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=339+Convent+Avenue,+New+York,+NY&amp;daddr=City+Island,+Bronx,+NY&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.856734,-73.900995&amp;sspn=0.049273,0.127115&amp;geocode=FdfrbgIdfKqX-ykBVuVee_bCiTHMGflUcEPT9g%3BFeRFbwIdlhea-yk5x2j7eIzCiTG6DBMcYzcBJA&amp;oq=339+Convent+Avenue&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;gl=us&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=13">12 miles</a> from their home on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122357/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/video_dropping_by_the_royal_tenenba.php">339 Convent Avenue</a> is where little Chazzy got that BB lodged in between his knuckles. </p>

<p>In 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122357/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/realestate/29livi.html">the NY Times</a> visited the island, noting that the Queen Anne home is also where <em>Long Day&#x2019;s Journey Into Night</em> was filmed, and the 1.5 mile long island also became home to <em>Law &amp; Order</em> for an episode.</p>

<p>Are you sold on City Island&apos;s charms? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122357/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2012/01/12/a_restored_19thcentury_sea_captains_house_in_the_bronx.php">Curbed</a> noted today that a 19th century sea captain&apos;s house down the street from the Tenenbaum&apos;s is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122357/http://www.elliman.com/new-york-city/bronx/city-island/586-city-island-avenue/xdbnkpa">on the market</a>, if you want to summer like Royal. And this one also has an in-house bonus: this home is where Cary Grant&apos;s <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em> was filmed.</p>
