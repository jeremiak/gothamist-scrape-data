<p>Want to sit next to your pals at the big concert? Or stalk the guy you like <em>offline</em>? Well now Ticketmaster will let you do those things! The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144816/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ticketmaster-delivers-social-connectivity-into-interactive-seat-maps-128278308.html">has teamed up with</a> Facebook, and starting today you can buy tickets via an interactive seating chart, which shows where your Facebook friends are sitting.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144816/http://www.fastcompany.com/1774825/ticketmaster-unveils-seat-tagging-on-facebook">Fast Company</a>, Ticketmaster CEO Nathan Hubbard isn&apos;t really trying to bring you closer to your friends, he just happened to notice that every time a ticket buyer shared with Facebook friends that he was attending an event, it generated $5.30 in additional ticket revenue. Seat maps will also be made available after each event, so presumably you can tell that guy who spilled beer on you what you <em>really</em> think. </p>

<p>At a meeting, a Miami Dolphins executive was heard declaring: &quot;This is sick.&quot; Anyway, not to harsh your superfriends buzz, but why didn&apos;t your pals just invite you along to the concert when they were buying tickets in the first place?</p>
