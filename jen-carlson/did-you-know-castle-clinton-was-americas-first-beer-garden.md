<p>Did <em>you</em> know that Castle Clinton in Battery Park is said to be the first ever beer garden in America? The structure&#x2014;now a national monument&#x2014;has had many incarnations (most overlapping), including a theater, an exhibition hall, an immigration station (predating Ellis Island), and a public aquarium. </p>

<p>Its life as a beer garden&#x2014;then called Castle Garden&#x2014;began on July 3rd, 1824, coming alive inside of the former Army fort, which shuttered a few years earlier. These illustrations showing the beer garden (also a theater at the time) appeared in Harper&apos;s New Monthly Magazine in the 1800s. Do you think any of these people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814142131/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/new_yorkers_cross_frozen_east_river.php">walked over a frozen East River</a> to get there during winter months? While the garden was open air at first, a roof was eventually added.</p>

<p>On July 22nd of <em>this year</em>, a new beer garden will open just down the street from America&apos;s first, and they tell us they&apos;ll be paying homage to Castle Garden. Stay tuned for more details and photos on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814142131/http://clintonhallny.com/">Clinton Hall</a>.</p>
