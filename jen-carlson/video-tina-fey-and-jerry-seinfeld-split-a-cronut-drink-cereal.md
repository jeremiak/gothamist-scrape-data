<p>In the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173703/http://gothamist.com/tags/comediansincarsgettingcoffee"><em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</em></a>, Jerry Seinfeld takes Tina Fey to try out some of the sweetest items in the city. First at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173703/http://www.yelp.com/biz/harlems-floridita-bar-restaurant-new-york">Floridita</a> in Harlem, where they get some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173703/http://harlemsfloridita.com/drinks-menu/">Wheat Puffs Juice</a>... which is literally just cereal, sugar, and milk blended together into what looks like a shake. It looks amazing.</p>

<p>Later they hit up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173703/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiqueansel">Dominique Ansel</a> for his last Cronut of the day, where the chef breaks his rule by cutting it in half for them (he has personally scolded us for doing this). Fey, who had never experienced the Important Hybrid Pastry before, wondered:</p>

<p><strong>Fey:</strong> &quot;Is there gonna be chains of Cronut stores?&quot;<br>
<strong>Seinfeld:</strong> That&apos;s where it gets interesting because we know what every American would do...<br>
<strong>Fey:</strong> &quot;Wreck it. But instead he&apos;s French, so instead he&apos;ll take a 70 week vacation, and never make it again.&quot;</p>
