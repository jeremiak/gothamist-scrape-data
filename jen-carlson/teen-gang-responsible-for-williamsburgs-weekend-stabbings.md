They report: &quot;A machete-wielding mob marching down a gritty Brooklyn street stabbed a pair of teenagers Saturday during a bloody night in the city that left two other men dead. About 15 suspected gang members, wearing T-shirts over their faces, stormed down S. Third St. in Williamsburg around 2 a.m. brandishing 18-inch blades and yelling for their intended target to show himself.&quot; The group, who are said to belong to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160127211149/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/i-new-york/27840/gangs-of-new-york">Trinitarios gang</a>, couldn&apos;t find their target so attacked his two friends instead. They are both expected to survive. No arrests have been made, and it&apos;s still unclear if these stabbings were related to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160127211149/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/12/williamsburg_stabber_strikes_again.php">previous ones</a>.</p>
