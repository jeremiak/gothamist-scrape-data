<p>This week 40 colorful structures&#x2014;created by artists Jennifer Wong and Daniel Goers&#x2014;will go up as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121740/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_newsroom/daily_plants/daily_plant_main.php?id=22161">a new public arts installation</a> called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121740/http://myrtleavenuebirdtown.com/">Myrtle Avenue Bird Town</a>, and with it the artists will be giving bird&apos;s some more sanctuary in the big city. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121740/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/05/04/2010-05-04_tethering_their_nests_new_arty_hangout_in_boro_dozens_of_cool_birdhouses.html">the Daily News</a>, they&apos;ll be hanging from trees in Fort Greene Park and Person Square Triangle along Myrtle Avenue. Goers told the paper, &quot;We want to spread this idea that we&apos;re sharing the urban habitat. It&apos;s a little bit of bird activism.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the toxic waterway known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121740/http://gothamist.com/tags/gowanuscanal">Gowanus Canal</a> may also become an unlikely setting for a wildlife refuge. Some friends have started a Canal Nest Colony there, installing 22 yellow birdhouses along the canal in a little under two years, with plans to place more structures there this summer.</p>

<p>A former president of the Brooklyn Bird Club tried to explain the recent interest these young people have in birds&#x2014;Paul Keim says, &quot;A lot of the younger generation is seeing that we made a lot of mistakes and things have to be corrected.&quot; Saving the world, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121740/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/its-hip-to-be-a-young-creative-urbanite/">creative young urbanite</a> and one bird at a time.</p>
