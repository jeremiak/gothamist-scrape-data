</div></div>					<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207015221/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/photos_dumbo_under_water_janes_caro.php#photo-1">a few photos</a> of Jane&apos;s Carousel were circulating on Twitter, showing the carousel, inside of its lit up glass cube, taking on water and quickly becoming an island. The carousel, located at Brooklyn Bridge Park, is in Zone A, and much of that area of DUMBO was flooding as Hurricane Sandy hit New York and the East River started rising. </p>

<p>We went down there to see how things looked this morning, and it seems like the carousel survived! Aside from some tossed over trash cans and puddles inside of the cube, no major damage could be seen.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Brooklyn Bridge Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207015221/https://www.facebook.com/brooklynbridgepark/posts/10151520461568298">has an update</a> from Jane Walentas: &quot;The wooden carousel and horses as well as the building, are all fine. Unfortunately, however, the basement that houses all the electronics was totally flooded&#x2014;5ft. of water. As soon as we can pump it out we &apos;ll assess the damage. We&apos;re optimistic that the carousel will be fine, but it will probably take some time to get it fully restored to happily prancing again.&quot;</p>
