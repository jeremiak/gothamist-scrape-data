<p>Watch your back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121456/http://gothamist.com/tags/olek">Olek</a>, rope is the new yarn. Here&apos;s a preview of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121456/http://gothamist.com/tags/MadisonSquarePark">Madison Square Park</a>&apos;s new spring/summer installation, created by New York-based artist Orly Genger. The installation is titled &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121456/http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/mad-sq-art-orly-genger">Red, Yellow and Blue</a>&quot; and is created out of &quot;intricately hand-knotted nautical rope covered in paint, creating a work that will transform the park&#x2019;s lush lawns into colorfully-lined chambers&quot; and hidden nooks.</p>

<p>All in all, 1.4 million feet of rope&#x2014;the total length equating to nearly 20 times the length of Manhattan&#x2014;was used to create the 100,000 pound project.</p>
