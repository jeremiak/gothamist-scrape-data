<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414183800/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/12/nyc_la_cheers_over_nasa_shuttles_ho.php">NASA announced</a> that New York City would be receiving one of the retired space shuttles. Hurrah! Or not. Seems not everyone is happy that we got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110414183800/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/12/shuttle_enterpise_is_coming_to_the.php">the broken one</a>.

Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand could get us was a prototype. What&apos;s worse is that L.A. is getting a real one: The Endeavour. Where are they gonna put it, Disneyland?&quot; Good point, but also: <em>calm down lady</em>. Tantrums are for children who want sugary cereal, not grown adults. Plus, does it really matter?</p>

On a more positive note, Susan Marenoff-Zausner, the president of the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, issued this comment in celebration of the shuttle that will soon be on their deck:</p>

<blockquote>We are excited and honored to have been chosen as a home for the Enterprise, and to help perpetuate the legacy of one of our country&#x2019;s greatest technological achievements.   On behalf of everyone at the Intrepid, our thanks go out to NASA for recognizing that New York City will be a great home for her.

<p>We are grateful to our elected leaders who worked tirelessly on our behalf, including Senators Schumer and Gillibrand and the New York State Congressional Delegation; New York Governors Andrew Cuomo and David Paterson; New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg;  Council Speaker Christine Quinn; George Fertitta and NYC &amp; Co.; Bill Rudin and the Association for a Better New York; and the 19 Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients, 12 Distinguished Marines and the many others who wrote letters and signed the petition to NASA. </p>

<p>We are gratified that NASA has recognized that New York will be an outstanding home for Enterprise, and that the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum will create an amazing exhibit to showcase her.</p></blockquote><p></p>
