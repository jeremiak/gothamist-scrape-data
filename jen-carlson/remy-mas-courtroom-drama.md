To recap, so far in this ongoing saga there&apos;s been an alleged theft, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172741/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/16/remy.php">a shooting</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172741/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/27/remy_ma_1.php">a conviction</a>, a Rikers Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172741/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/12/remy_ma_and_pap.php">almost-wedding</a>, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172741/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/13/remy_ma_2.php">attempted jail break</a>, a sentencing...and finally, what is hopefully the last bit of drama: the courtroom outbursts. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172741/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/nyregion/14remy.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports that Remy&apos;s sentencing went from emotional to violent as the judge sentenced her to 8 years behind bars. Just after the gavel came down, her fiancee Papoose (real name: Shamele Mackie), &quot;flew into a rage, lunging and cursing at court officers, then overturning a garbage can near the elevator banks.&quot; (Anyone else thinking Makeda Barnes-Joseph should be expecting a visit from Papoose?)</p>

<p>Prior to that, inside the courtroom, Remy was called &#x201C;an extremely angry young woman&#x201D; by Barnes-Joseph, the victim. She added in her letter, read before the court, that &quot;after July 14, I stopped existing as a person. I am now known as a victim, a gold-digger, a groupie, a liar and thief. I will always be the girl they will whisper about. I will always be the girl who was shot by Remy.&#x201D; The rapper had her own emotional statement, however, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310172741/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1587389/20080513/ma__remy.jhtml">some believe</a> it got what was reportedly going to be a 13-year sentence, down to 8 years.</p><blockquote>She excoriated some of the reporters who covered her trial for calling her a &#x201C;hip-hop hellion,&#x201D; saying her aggressive stage persona was precisely that: a &#x201C;music industry creation&#x201D; and &#x201C;a facade. Remy Ma is not even close to who I am,&#x201D; she said through tears. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a thug. I&#x2019;m not a hardcore anything. I have feelings and emotions, and I&#x2019;m a human being like anybody else. I&#x2019;m Remy Smith.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I apologize,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;and I&#x2019;m sorry for not saving you. I feel so bad for all the physical and mental pain you went through, and go through. Myself, I have a lifetime scar on my face. So I know the pain you feel when I look in the mirror.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Kleenex, anyone?<p></p>
