<p>This weekend brings the season finale of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004824/http://gothamist.com/tags/thenewsroom"><em>The Newsroom</em></a>, Aaron Sorkin&apos;s kind of controversial HBO show that lifts the curtain to show the behind-the-scenes workings of (fictional) cable news show <em>News Night</em>, starring Jeff Daniels as news anchor Will McAvoy.</p>

<p>One of the main locations in the show&#x2014;aside from the ACN office, which is actually the Bank Of America building in Times Square&#x2014;is Hang Chew&apos;s, the staffers favorite bar. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004824/http://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom/cast-and-crew/neal-sampat/index.html">Neal Sampat</a> describes the place to co-worker Jim Harper in one episode, here&apos;s how it goes:</p><blockquote>Neal: There&apos;s a karaoke bar down the street we go to. Drinks and appetizers are $3 until 9.<br>
Jim: It&apos;s 9:15.<br>
Neal: We send an intern down at 8:55 to order 30 drinks and 4 platters of tuna jerky. The downside&apos;s the karaoke but it&apos;s the only place nearby that stays open late unless you want to go to the theater district.<br>
Jim: I thought the downside would be the 4 platters of tuna jerky.<br>
Neal: It&apos;s an affordable dinner.</blockquote>If you&apos;ve got a hankering for some tuna jerky, however, we&apos;re sorry to report that <em>Hang Chew&apos;s does not really exist</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004824/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">Typical Hollywood move</a>. If it did exist, however, it would be right on the same block as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004824/http://www.yelp.com/biz/jimmys-corner-new-york#query:jimmy%27s%20bar">Jimmy&apos;s Corner</a> and two doors down from Virgil&apos;s, on 44th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. In real life this is the Times Deli, which also doesn&apos;t sell tuna jerky... and only has 2.5 stars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004824/http://www.yelp.com/biz/times-deli-new-york">on Yelp</a>.<p></p>
