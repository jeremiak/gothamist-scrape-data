<p>Hey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031551/http://gothamist.com/tags/patkiernan">Pat Kiernan</a> fans, the NY1 anchor was asked to return to guest host <em>LIVE! With Kelly</em>. Kiernan hosted one show with Kelly Ripa <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031551/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/now_pat_kiernan_co-hosts_live_with.php">last month</a>, and we were just told that he was asked to return on April 30th and May 1st. </p>

<p>After Regis Philbin left last November, Kelly has been searching for the perfect replacement, and we&apos;re excited that she seems to have her eye on Kiernan (she noted his first guest-host gig was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031551/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/pat_kiernan_eyes_regiss_chair.php">a year in the making</a>).  We got in touch with Kiernan this evening, and he told us, &quot;The invitation to return says they liked me enough that they wanted to see more.  But I&apos;ve definitely got to take it up a notch.  With two days in a row I&apos;ve got a chance to get comfortable on the spiffy new set and get into a routine with Kelly. There&apos;s still pressure to perform, but I&apos;m much more at ease this time because we&apos;ve done this before.&quot;</p>

<p>On April 30th, Kelly and Pat will sit down with Donald Trump, and on May 1st they&apos;ll talk to <em>Hawaii Five-O</em> star Daniel Dae Kim, and DJ Samantha Ronson. We&apos;ll be on hand again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031551/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/pat_kiernans_dreams_come_true_on_li.php#photo-1">to report live from LIVE!, again</a>. Sadly, this time around we heard there won&apos;t be any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031551/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/pat_kiernans_dreams_come_true_on_li.php#photo-5">free gum</a>, as they took the famous gum chewing wall down earlier this month.</p>
