<p>We&apos;ve all mixed a little lemonade into our beers before (what, you never had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911043657/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/five_great_beer_cocktails_and_where.php">a shandy</a>?), but what about iced tea mixed with beer? It&apos;s happening. The frankenbeer was created by the people of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911043657/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/06/molsoncoors-idUSL2E8E5CHT20120306">Coors Brewing</a>, and it&apos;s coming to your local bodega sometime in April of this year. </p>

<p>Coors Light Iced T will be a caffeine-free, tea-flavored beer, packing a 4% alcohol content. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911043657/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/iced-tea-flavored-beer-molson-launch-coors-light-iced-t-citrus-y-brew-appeal-cocktail-drinkers-article-1.1034947?localLinksEnabled=false">the Daily News</a>, the company hopes to draw in drinkers who would normally order a wine or cocktail. Well, it&apos;s gotta be better than the margarita-flavored beer Anheuser-Busch just announced, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911043657/http://beerstreetjournal.com/anheuser-busch-testing-lime-a-rita/">Lime-a-Rita</a>. </p>

<p>And as we know from alcoholic beverage history, trying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911043657/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_uxyXekDjo"><em>zomething different</em></a> always works out&#x2014;it was right after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911043657/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zima">MillerCoors LLC</a> added citrus, tangerine, and pineapple citrus flavors to the <em>already perfect</em> Zima that they discontinued the product all together. Massive beer corporations: stop trying to be mixologists, we&apos;ll bring our own lemonade to the party.</p>
