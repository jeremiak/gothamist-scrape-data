<p>Someone bring Gwyneth Paltrow a wine cooler! (Can we call her Sir Gwyneth Paltrow now? Gender aside, it just seems fitting?) Anyway, the actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410033201/http://twitter.com/#!/GwynethPaltrow/status/123834535547912193">just Tweeted</a>: &quot;Shooting in sunny central park. Reminds me of my youth. Whatever happened to bartles and jaymes? Could rock one of those things.&quot;</p>

<p>Did Gwyneth really drink Bartles &amp; Jaymes in her youth? Would she <em>really</em> <strike>drink</strike> rock one now? Someone please go scatter some of GOOP-preferred brand of wine coolers around the set of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410033201/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1932718/"><em>Thanks For Sharing</em></a> and let&apos;s see if she can put her money where her Tweet is. Your move, Sir Gwyneth Paltrow. (Though we should note, she <em>has</em> been hitting the juice pretty hard lately, first Tweeting about being hungover, and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410033201/http://twitter.com/#!/Courtney/status/117493308703510528/photo/1">posing for this pic</a> at a bar with Courtney Love.)</p>

<p>As an aside: Why aren&apos;t there any Brooklyn artisanalsters recreating the wine cooler? That is something we would like to see happen.</p>
