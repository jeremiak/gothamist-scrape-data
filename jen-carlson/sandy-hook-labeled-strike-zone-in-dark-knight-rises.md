<p>Some idle corners of the Internet are chattering about a number of coincidences that would appear to connect <em>Dark Knight Rises</em> with America&apos;s two most recent horrifying gun massacres. After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141216125215/http://laist.com/2012/07/20/dark_knight_rises_massacre_12_kille.php">mass shooting</a> in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater during a midnight screening for the film, the word &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141216125215/http://gothamist.com/tags/aurora">Aurora</a>&quot; was spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141216125215/http://rense.com/general95/sandyaurora.html">in bright lights</a> atop a building in <em>Dark Knight Rises</em>. Now it seems the name &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; also has ties to the Batman flick... two, it would seem. </p>

<p>Before the movie came out, some media outlets received a &quot;viral package&quot; that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141216125215/http://www.ugo.com/movies/the-dark-knight-rises-viral-package-strike-1">contained a map</a> showing a targeted area called Sandy Hook, which was labeled &quot;Strike Zone 1.&quot; In the movie, this is where Gotham Stadium is, and Commissioner Gordon points to it on a map (it&apos;s the only thing you can read on the map aside from the word &quot;Gotham&quot;). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141216125215/http://www.infowars.com/dark-knight-rises-shows-sandy-hook-written-on-map/">What&apos;s circulating</a> is a theory that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141216125215/http://gothamist.com/tags/newtownshooting">Sandy Hook massacre</a> was, on some subliminal level, brought on by the movie:</p><blockquote>&quot;As more of these &apos;strange coincidences&apos; continue to pop up, it would take a fool not to question the motive behind it all: Is this all part of an evil pre-conditioning program? This definitely begins to tread into Satanic and occult territory, the purpose of which is known to only a select few in tight-knit circles at the very top branches of various secret societies.&quot;</blockquote>This attempt to draw a legitimate connection between a fictional film and a devastating real-life massacre comes off as trivializing. But we&apos;ve got to admit it&apos;s a pretty weird coincidence. If you&apos;re inclined to take a closer look, there&apos;s this:<p></p>
