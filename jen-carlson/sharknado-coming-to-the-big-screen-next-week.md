<p>For one night only&#x2014;Friday, August 2nd&#x2014;the SyFy network&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220023/http://gothamist.com/tags/sharknado"><em>Sharknado</em></a> will leave the small screen and be placed in a real, legit movie theater so you can behold the terrible acting and graphics in a larger than life format. Will it be lo-res and pixelated? Probably?</p>

<p>Only two theaters in the five boroughs are participating: the College Point Multiplex (2855 Ulmer St in Flushing) and Union Square Stadium 14 (850 Broadway)&#x2014;but there will also be screenings in New Jersey, New Rochelle, White Plains, and even the fancy pants Hamptons because everyone loves a Sharknado.</p>

<p>Screenings will start at midnight, and we&apos;re pretty sure that means Friday going in to Saturday but the press release doesn&apos;t clarify that because everything about <em>Sharknado</em> is confusing. It does, however, promise &quot;cinema audiences never-before-seen footage including a behind-the-scenes featurette and a gag reel&quot; for those who have been wondering what <em>wasn&apos;t good enough</em> to make it into this thing:</p>
