<p>Earlier this week a woman became the latest humiliating statistic in the War On Twexting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184949/http://www.abc57.com/news/local/Woman-who-fell-off-pier-after-texting-while-walking-shares-her-story-143602656.html">Bonnie Miller</a> was texting and walking simultaneously on a pier in Michigan on Monday when she walked <em>right off of the edge</em> and fell into the water (she&apos;s okay!). Sadly, the incident wasn&apos;t caught on film, so cannot be added to the expansive video library of archival footage documenting the Texting Zombie for future generations to gaze upon, confused. Because in the future, there will be no Texting Zombies&#x2014;our War On Twexting will eventually eradicate this method of multitasking, <em>right?</em> We need to believe. </p>

<p>Below, you will find plenty of documentation of humans being idiots&#x2014;let them serve as a reminder to not twext, lest you yourself become one of these idiots. Stop texting while walking, and join the Army of Common Sense.</p>
