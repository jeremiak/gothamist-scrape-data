title: Road To Nowhere: David Byrne's Bike Stolen

<p><img alt="2007_04_arts_bryne.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203181419im_/http://www.gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2007_04_arts_bryne.jpg" width="180" height="240" class="left">David Byrne&apos;s foldable Montague mountain bike has been stolen. The avid city biker rode in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203181419/http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2006/05/5706_cia_5boro_.html">5 Boro Bike Tour last year</a>, commenting: &quot;The organizers close the FDR drive, the BQE, the Belt Parkway and the Verrazano-Narrows bridge on one side &#x2014; so we get the thrill of riding in the middle of the street, not having to stop at red lights and no worries of the ubiquitous jaywalking peds on suicide missions.&quot;</p>

<p>This past weekend however, after a shorter ride, he had locked his bike up outside of the IFC Center only to find it missing upon his return, an all too familiar city tale. That stretch of 6th Avenue isn&apos;t looking to good lately, with a Talking Heads bike theft, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203181419/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/04/12/lesbians_on_tri.php">lesbians beating up straight men</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203181419/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/02/23/west_village_re.php">rats running rampant</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120203181419/http://www.papermag.com/blogs/2007/04/david_byrnes_bike_stolen.php">Papermag</a> blog reports:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;David Byrne is many things -- musician, artist, lecturer, blogger -- but most endearingly he&apos;s an avid city bicyclist. The vision that lingers most from Miami&apos;s Basel Art Fair was that of Byrne making the rounds on his bicycle. So you can imagine how I felt when I heard the news that his bike was stolen over the weekend right in front of the IFC theater! &quot;If anyone sees a bike with both a Che sticker and one for the MOST space telescope that&apos;s mine,&quot; says Byrne who&apos;s already back on the streets sporting a new two wheeler as he goes around organizing an Alternative Transportation Music Festival for Oct. 6 at Town Hall.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Byrne can afford a new bike - but this one seemed pretty personal to him. What we want to know is...what&apos;s this about an Byrne-curated Alternative Transportation Music Festival?</p>
