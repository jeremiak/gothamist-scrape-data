This year they&apos;re delivering twelve songs which make up their label-debut full length album, <em>The Broken String</em> (out July 24th).</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>The Harvard grads who formed the band, Justin Rice and Christian Rudder, also wear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142737/http://gothamist.com/2005/05/06/funny_ha_ha.php">their acting hats</a> from time to time. Perhaps fittingly their band has had a rotating cast of members, and currently includes drummer Cully Symington and vocalist/percussionist Darbie Nowatka along with a long list of collaborators. They&apos;ll all be on stage at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142737/http://seaportmusicfestival.com/">Seaport Music Festival</a> this Friday where they play with Rock Plaza Central.</em></p>

<p><strong>On the 20th you play the Seaport and after that it looks like you&apos;re on the road for a good amount of time, do you all have day jobs?</strong><br>
No, we don&apos;t.  Constant touring is the perfect antidote to a day job. That and cheap living.</p>

<p><strong>What do you miss most about New York when you&apos;re on the road?</strong><br>
When I&apos;m about to leave New York, there&apos;s nothing I expect to miss.  But when I return after being gone for a while, there&apos;s this moment of great relief, and I draw a big breath, and all of the sudden I feel lucky.  Like maybe I didn&apos;t expect the city to be here still.  Or maybe I expected everything to be unrecognizable.  But it&apos;s always here, and it&apos;s always instantly familiar.  Most of my friends live here, and while tour is busy and crowded full of people, I&apos;m always happy to get back to my friends.</p>

<p><strong>Last year you put an EP out every month, what was that experience like? And have you thought about challenging yourselves like that again?</strong><br>
I imagine old-timey newspaper reporters in a crowded press room squeaking by one deadline only to find there&apos;s another one staring them down. That&apos;s what it was like.  We spent all day confined to our tiny, windowless studio, and we were always hustling to finish songs, but it made us write and write and write, and everything we wrote gave us new energy and enthusiasm.  We would never do the exact same thing again, but we will definitely come up with more harebrained schemes and crackpot challenges.  We&apos;ve got to keep things interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Please share your strangest &quot;only in New York&quot; story.</strong><br>
Yesterday, my neighbor and my landlord had a talk that lasted over an hour.  I could hear them through the walls.  Thing is, my neighbor only speaks Spanish, and my landlord only speaks Polish.  I&apos;ve never been able to get very far in a conversation with either one of them.  Usually, no matter what I try to get across, all I can get out of my landlord is  &quot;my son, tomorrow, he fix,&quot; or &quot;everything okay,&quot; and even then, I&apos;m never sure whether those phrases are questions or statements.  Ditto with the neighbor.  What were they talking about?  And how were they talking about whatever they were talking about for an hour?  I&apos;m still puzzled.</p>
