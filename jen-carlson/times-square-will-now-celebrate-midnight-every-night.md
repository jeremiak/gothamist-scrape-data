										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:275px; "> <img alt="timessquareevemidngiht.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522094031im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/timessquareevemidngiht.jpg" width="275" height="225"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522094031/http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliver62/4232261122/">062&apos;s Flickr</a></span></i></div> The Times Square Advertising Coalition isn&apos;t satisfied with just one midnight blowout each year, they want to make it a daily event. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522094031/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/a-new-midnight-moment-in-times-square/">the NY Times</a>, midnight will be special all 365 days of the year starting in 2011, when the coalition introduces a nightly &#x201C;Times Square Midnight Moment.&quot; <p></p>

<p>While you shouldn&apos;t expect the drunken hordes covered in confetti (or maybe you should?), you can expect to see digital billboards illuminated. Oooh, ahhhh. But aren&apos;t the digital billboards <em>always</em> illuminated? According to the paper, the goal is to add &#x201C;a new must-see attraction&#x201D; to the area that will &quot;offer a bright end to each evening in Times Square.&quot;</p>

<p>Someone start making novelty glasses for every individual date!</p>
