Their live shows will break through even the most disaffected and jaded music listeners with a brand of Americana that has been known to induce smiles, and maybe even a tapping foot. This Saturday they&apos;ll play at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110305/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/05/week_in_rock_1.php?gallery0Pic=3#gallery">our Northside Festival show</a> prior to heading out on tour.</em><p></p>

<p><strong>How did the band come together, and where did the name come from?</strong> Well, I was depressed and without any friends, like a lot of people are when they first move to New York. I met Eric Engel and Timo Sullivan at The New School in September of &#x2019;06. All three of us were students there. That was the beginning of the band.</p>

<p>We started recording songs in Timo&#x2019;s apartment in Jersey City, mostly in the basement (where we all breathed much asbestos and spiderdust!) and in Timo&#x2019;s kitchen, where I drank many a cup of coffee and sang many a back-up vocal to a song called &#x201C;Coffee.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Jeremy and Erik joined the band later. (Timo found these alien eggs off the New Jersey Turnpike and put them in this incubator and out they came!) It was the coolest thing that ever happened to any of us. New Denver was recorded back in Colorado with us as a four-piece (Engel, Sully, Theis, Duvall). Gundel&#x2019;s alien egg hatched a little later. Then we were a real band, not just a recording project of sorts.</p>

<p>As for the name of the band: a good friend of mine from back home (Denver, Colorado) came up with it a long time before the band ever formed. He was working as a night janitor at a hotel in downtown Denver. It was called Hotel Teatro. He was down on all the fancy names of hotels... He said to me, &#x201C;why not just hotel hotel?&#x201D; like G. Stein&#x2019;s &#x201C;rose is a rose is a rose&#x201D; or something. For some reason, it stuck with me. I liked the idea of a hotel without pretense, because that just does not fucking exist.</p>

<p>Then, a year or so later, we all found out that there was already a band called Hotel Hotel, so we went for the cheaper alternative. After all, it was 3am and the marquee said there was vacancy, so... Well, the rest is history. Boo-ya. We all made love to each other.</p>
