</div></div>					<p>Eric Schneider may have transformed his 450-square-foot studio apartment in Manhattan with the help of some architects and a giant blue... thing, but that&apos;s totally not impressive if you know about Gary Chang&apos;s 344-square-foot &quot;green&quot; apartment in Hong Kong, that he gorgeously altered to encapsulate 24 separate rooms. Take a look (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070651/http://www.yossawat.com/2009/04/gary-chang%E2%80%99s-apartment/">it glows</a>!):</p>

<p>The woman living in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070651/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/video_woman_shows_off_90-square-foo.php">90-square-foot apartment</a> on the Upper West Side could really use Chang&apos;s help! Anyway, sure, Schneider&apos;s blue monster folds to create a living room, kitchen, breakfast nook, desk, closet, bookshelves, bed, and guest bed. But there&apos;s not even a screening room. There&apos;s not even <em>a hammock!</em> Come on, New York, we can do better, at least aesthetically. Click through for photos and layouts of both Chang and Schneider&apos;s folding apartments.
