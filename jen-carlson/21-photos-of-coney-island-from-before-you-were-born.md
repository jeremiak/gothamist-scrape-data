</div></div>					<p>In the above photos you&apos;ll see Coney Island as it looked in the late 1800s through the early 1920s&#x2014;right up until when the boardwalk was being built. And here are a few facts from the 1800s that you may not know about the area: </p><ul><li>Native American inhabitants (specifically, the Lenape) called the area Narrioch&#x2014;meaning &quot;land without shadows.&quot;<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>There are many beliefs about the origins of its modern day name, one being that Coney Island translates to &quot;Rabbit Island,&quot; and &quot;rabbit hunting prospered until resort development eliminated their habitat.&quot;<br>
</li><li>From 1885 to 1896, the Coney Island Elephant (which you&apos;ll see in the above photos) was the first sight to greet immigrants arriving here.<br>
</li><li>The original Coney Island Hotel was constructed in 1829.<br>
</li><li>In the 1830s and 1840s, carriage roads and steamship services began to make the trip to Coney Island easier, with reduced travel time from a half-day journey to just two hours from Manhattan and other boroughs.<br>
</li><li>&quot;When the first structures were built around the 1840s, there was an outcry to prevent any development on the island and preserve it as a natural park.&quot; (Robert Moses would oppose the new amusements and &quot;tawdry&quot; entertainment at Coney Island in 1944.)<br>
</li><li>Coney Island became a major resort destination after the American Civil War.</li></ul><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914222216/http://coneyisland40years.com/about/coney-island-timeline/">Here&apos;s a great, thorough timeline</a> of the area, dating back to the 1600s.
