<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025816/http://gothamist.com/tags/bobdylan">Bob Dylan</a> hits the road this summer, he won&apos;t be playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025816/http://www.bobdylan.com/us/upcoming-dates">any dates</a> in New York City proper, which means if you want to see the iconic folk hero, you&apos;ll have to go to Jones Beach or New Jersey. And the latter option just got way more intriguing&#x2014;someone amazing named Andreas is offering to set you up with his FLY BOARD to use during the concert, which is being performed at a venue on the Hudson River. Here is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025816/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tix/3783823793.html">Craigslisting</a> (here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025816/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/flyboarddylanad.jpg">screenshot</a>):</p>

<blockquote>&quot;My name is Andreas and I am renting out my fly board for the duration of the Bob Dylan show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619025816/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/04/bob_dylan_to_perform_at_pier_a.html">at Pier A in Hoboken</a>. I will take 1 person via jet ski from Jersey City over to the show along with the apparatus. If you&apos;ve never fly boarded before I will give a free 1 hour lesson prior to the show. It is a lot of fun and a unique experience. The fly board I have can hover at approx 28&apos; feet above the water if used properly. It will be the coolest way to watch Bob play and everyone will see you and think you&apos;re the coolest guy in the world for watching in such a unique way.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>On the one hand, it costs $400, on the other hand:</p>
