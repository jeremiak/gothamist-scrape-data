<p>Street art or street rat? Whether it was intentional or not, it looks like our newest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232419/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadrat">Sad Rat</a> has briefly become a part of this piece in Brooklyn. R.I.P. street art rat, you didn&apos;t die in vain. (And on the upside, this means one less rat in the impending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519232419/http://gothamist.com/tags/ratdemic">ratdemic</a> that is taking over the city.)</p>
