<p>As we mentioned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124210505/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/the_cast_of_downton_abbey_is_coming.php">earlier this month</a>, the cast of <em>Downton Abbey</em> would be in New York, and here&apos;s a clip from their panel...  though be warned, it&apos;s sort of jarring to see them in modern day clothes and talking about Laura Linney, <em>The Wire</em>, and making Occupy Downton jokes. However, they will make you feel better about not understanding <em>everything</em> in the show.</p>

<p>Season Two finally comes to the States, on PBS, on January 8th, with Thirteen airing a full Season One marathon at 3 p.m. on New Year&apos;s Day.
