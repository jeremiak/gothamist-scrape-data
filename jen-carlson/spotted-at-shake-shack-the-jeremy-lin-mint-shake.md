<p>It&apos;s only natural that the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park has created a tribute to the current star at Madison Square Garden. So please make some room for the establishment on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141008214710/http://gothamist.com/tags/linsanity">the Linwagon</a>, as they are now offering the Jeremy Lin-Mint shake, which is made with chocolate mint cookies. To take it to the next level, we recommend <em>dunking</em> some Thin Mints in there.</p>

<p>Currently they only plan on serving the novelty shake through the 19th&#x2014;which is the day the Knicks will play the Mavericks&#x2014; but we&apos;ve contacted their HQ to find out if they&apos;ll extend it.  Hey, Brooklyn Ikea, are you going to sell a special Jeremy Lingonberry Pie?</p>
