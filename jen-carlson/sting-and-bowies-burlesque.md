The 5,500 square foot space at 19 Kenmare Street (which includes a basement and first floor) will turn in to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045803/http://www.observer.com/2007/its-curtains-little-italys-little-charlies-bowie-backed-burlesque-show-replacing-it">a burlesque haven</a> later this year, housing Ivan Kane&apos;s famous show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045803/http://www.fortydeuce.com/">Forty Deuce</a> (originally named for 42nd Street). With tiered seating and a stage, the new space will be part of the transformation happening in the 14,000 square foot building purchased by David Zahabian for $10M. </p>

<p>From Kane&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045803/http://www.fortydeuce.com/newyork-entertainment.php">website</a>: &quot;This intimate, exclusive, back-alley club comes replete with velvet rope and gorgeous people. At Ivan Kane&apos;s Forty Deuce New York Nightclub, you&apos;ll find the naughty yet sophisticated atmosphere of old-school striptease joints. Watch as gifted burlesque dancers sashay down the bar in front of the legendary curtain of pearls. It&apos;s dirty-cool...&quot;</p>

<p>So who&apos;s bringing burlesque to Kenmare Street? David Bowie and Sting, of course. The Observer reports: &quot;Sting and David Bowie are direct partners. They are going to be involved in the creative process. Forty Deuce is a burlesque show that Kane started in Las Vegas in 2002. He has since opened a branch in Los Angeles, and has been in talks to bring the show to New York for some time.&quot; Wonder if they&apos;ll invite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045803/http://www.fortydeuce.com/britney.php">Britney to perform</a>.</p>
