										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="php9xrYupAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081008im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php9xrYupAM.jpg" width="325" height="209" class="image-right"> </span>The mysterious, black-clad troupe of troublemakers&#x2014;who most recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081008/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/ninjas.php">smashed a tea shop window</a> on Bedford Avenue&#x2014;has spoken. Or rather, has emailed. The full press release is after the jump, and attempts to describe the method behind their madness. </p>

<p>It says, in part: &quot;Dressed in matching black skirts and masks, dozens gathered on Saturday evening for an anti-capitalist Take Back the Night march, stopping traffic on Bedford Avenue, overturning trashcans, and breaking windows. We are not asking for a right to the streets, we are taking them; we are not asking for advertisements that do not objectify women, we&#x2019;re destroying the commercial mechanisms that objectify women; we are not appealing to male power for an end to rape, but threatening: &apos;If you touch me, I will fucking kill you.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>They go on to declare their refusal to be &quot;housewives and fuck-toys,&quot; but what they do not do is explain why they broke the window of a little tea shop. <em>Sooo</em> basically, fighting violence with confusing, misdirected, messy, violent outbursts. Well done ladies?
