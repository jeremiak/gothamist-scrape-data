</div></div>					<p>The indispensable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231233623/http://images.google.com/hosted/life">LIFE image archive</a> has an entire catalog of photos titled &quot;Bronx Slums&quot; which were taken in 1952 and 1953 (though the words &quot;Bronx Slums&quot; have been spotted in print for decades before and decades after that). </p>

<p>A few years ago the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231233623/http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-09-27/nyc-life/close-up-on-mott-haven-bronx/gothamgirlsrollerderby.com/gothamgirlsrollerderby.com">Village Voice</a> took a look at the South Bronx area (known as America&apos;s worst slum), recalling: &quot;<strong>Robert Moses slammed his fist into the neighborhood in the 1940s and 1950s, &apos;clearing the slums,&apos; stacking the displaced in spiritless public housing towers, and sealing them behind a rampart of expressways</strong>: the Bruckner to the east and the Major Deegan to the south and west.&quot; And that&apos;s what&apos;s happening in the photos above. </p>

<p>As residents fled the area, so did blue-collar jobs, which caused poverty and crime to take over. The paper noted at the time, &quot;Mott Haven became the South Bronx of infamy, and remained so until the drug and gang wars finally began to burn out in the early 1990s.&quot;</p>
