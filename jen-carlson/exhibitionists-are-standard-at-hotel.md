										<p>The naked truth about the Standard Hotel originally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194952/http://curbed.com/archives/2009/07/06/reader_rant_rave_standard_hotels_peep_show.php">broke on Curbed</a> in early July, and now it&apos;s made it all the way to the desk of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194952/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/ns/nightly_news_with_brian_williams#32558807">Brian Williams</a> after getting daily coverage in the New York papers this week.</p>

One bellhop told them, <strong>&quot;We don&apos;t discourage it. In actual fact, we encourage it. One of the managers even got naked in a room, and filmed it&#x2014;they were considering a live feed for the Web site.&quot;</strong> Such shenanigans were encouraged amongst the staff in order to generate buzz... and buzz they&apos;ve received. Earlier this week, even City Council Speaker Christine Quinn asked them to tone it down.</p>

<p>While management declared they were sensitive to prudish neighborhood concerns, when the Post sent undercover reporters there yesterday, the woman who checked them in declared, &quot;Do what you want. Just enjoy it!&quot; Adding, &quot;It would be illegal for anyone to take your picture through the window.&quot; Don&apos;t worry, shutterbugs, it&apos;s not illegal&#x2014;so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424194952/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send us your pics</a> already!</p>
