<p>A unicorn has gone missing near Central Park and West 72nd Street! There&apos;s a reward&#x2014;and probably some good karma&#x2014;if you can lead to the retrieval of the magical creature. We called the number where a friendly sounding woman has left a recording asking for any information that could lead to the return of her horned pet. Let&apos;s just hope it doesn&apos;t turn up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514172855/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/26/goat_head_found_in_prospect_park.php">in Prospect Park</a> or pulling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514172855/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">a carriage</a>.</p>
