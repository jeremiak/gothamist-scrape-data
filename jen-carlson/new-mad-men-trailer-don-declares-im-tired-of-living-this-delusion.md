<p>Today AMC released the first real trailer for the upcoming 6th season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145515/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, which will air in a two-hour premiere on April 7th. The trailer includes footage from the previous season, mixed with sound-bytes from the upcoming one&#x2014;most notably, Don says the following while scenes featuring him and Megan are showing: &quot;What is happiness... it&apos;s a moment before you need more happiness,&quot; and &quot;I&apos;m tired of living this delusion.&quot; As the the trailer cuts to last year&apos;s finale, Don says, &quot;I am who I am... the next thing will be better.&quot;</p>

<p>The trailer is soundtracked by Elle King&apos;s &quot;Playing For Keeps,&quot; where these lyrics are heard: &quot;It&apos;s a lonely road, where the forgotten goes / where your misery finds its company / its a long way down to the sacred ground / where the people play for keeps.&quot;<br>
