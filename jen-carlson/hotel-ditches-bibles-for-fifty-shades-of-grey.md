										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="fiftyshades0712.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215852im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/fiftyshades0712.jpeg" width="350" height="257" class="image-right"> </span>Strand Bookstore is reporting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215852/http://strandbooks.tumblr.com/post/27980450242/grey-to-replace-god">via their Tumblr</a> that at least one hotel has gone and replaced the Bible with <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>. But who wants to touch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215852/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NygOFsExGMU">a flagged copy</a> of <em>that</em> book?</p>

<p>The UK&apos;s Damson Dene Hotel&apos;s manager Wayne Bartholomew explains, &quot;I thought it would be a special treat for our guests to find it in their bedside cabinet and that includes the men too. They are as desperate to get their hands on a copy as the women.&#x201D; And anyway, The Gideon Bible is full of references to sex and violence, although it&#x2019;s written using more formal language, so James&#x2019;s book is easier to read.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Owner Jonathan Denby also chimed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215852/http://www.slow-life.co.uk/2012/07/13/replacing-the-bible-with-fifty-shades-of-grey/">on his blog</a>, saying, &quot;<strong>Tonight millions of women will be curling up in bed with a good book and you can bet your life it won&#x2019;t be the Bible</strong> ... I substituted the Gideon Bibles with <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> in all the bedrooms ... In this secular age it seems distinctly odd that anyone would expect to find a religious book in a hotel bedroom.&quot;</p>

<p>Hopefully if New York City-based hotels follow suit, they&apos;ll go with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215852/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/fifty_shades_1.php">some better smut</a>.</p>
