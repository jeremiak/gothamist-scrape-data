<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143847/http://bkbazaar.com/">Brooklyn Night Bazaar</a>, which was displaced from their spacious home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143847/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/11/brooklyn_night_bazaar_bmw.php">by BMW</a> last year, has found a glorious new home in Greenpoint: Polonaise Terrace, an old Polish banquet hall. And we&apos;ve gotten in on the action...</p>

<p>We&apos;ll be presenting the Grand Opening weekend: September 9th and 10th, and we&apos;re now able to announce our headliners: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143847/http://cyhsy.com/">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143847/http://gothamist.com/tags/clapyourhandssayyeah">remember them?</a>) on 9/9, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143847/http://www.whitedenim.com/pissedjeans/">Pissed Jeans</a> on 9/10. </p>

<p>Tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143847/http://www.eventbrite.com/o/brooklyn-bazaar-11108745675">go on sale today</a>, though admission will always be free-of-charge to come enjoy the offerings in other sections of the venue, including the market and restaurant, the arcade, karaoke, mini golf, and a ping pong disco zone.<br>

<p>A lot is changing this year: For the first time ever, the Bazaar &quot;will be presenting a permanent 7 day a week restaurant and bar, collaborating with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143847/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/11/brooklyn_star_joaquin_baca_interview.php">Joaquin Baca</a> of Brooklyn Star on a permanent 7 day a week restaurant,&quot; called Brooklyn Star @ BK. Baca will also &quot;custom curate the kitchen for the weekend Night Bazaars,&quot; including Brunch Bazaars, bringing in a rotating crew of NYC chefs. </p>

<p>The three-level venue will operate 7 days a week, feature 4 bars, the restaurant, a vendor space, a 400-capacity live music space (once things kick off there will be weekday concerts as well), and an event space featuring other programming, like a weekly Nighthawk Cinema movie series.</p>
