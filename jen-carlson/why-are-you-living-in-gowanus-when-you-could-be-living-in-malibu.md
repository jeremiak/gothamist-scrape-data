<p>The LA Times has published a piece titled: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081210/http://www.latimes.com/opinion/livable-city/la-ol-la-new-york-housing-square-foot-livable-city-20151029-story.html">A Manhattan studio costs how much? What your L.A. money could buy in New York</a>.&quot; It&apos;s ostensibly about how you get more for your money in the real estate market out West. But it&apos;s really about how a large, shiny living space is important to the people of Los Angeles, and less important to New Yorkers. </p>

<blockquote>On a per-square-foot basis, many of L.A.&#x2019;s iconic neighborhoods are priced far more reasonably than their New York counterparts. Santa Monica ($997/square foot) and Beverly Hills and Bel-Air (both $941) are less than half the price per square foot of Greenwich Village ($2,576), Gramercy Park ($2,424) or Tribeca ($2,338). Malibu ($905/square foot) and Pacific Palisades ($900) are better deals space-wise than Park Slope ($999). More surprisingly, Malibu and Beverly Hills are more affordable than Brooklyn&#x2019;s Gowanus ($1,047) &#x2014; a formerly industrial area that contains one of the most polluted bodies of water in the United States.</blockquote>Here&apos;s their graph, which uses square-footage to confusingly pair up Los Feliz with Brighton Beach, and Silver Lake with Bensonhurst.

<p>It&apos;s not very surprising that the Angelenos have taken such a shallow stance on real estate, if stereotypes were ever to ring true, these are a people who live a life driven by unrealistic beauty standards and pure fantasy. It&apos;s a land where the accumulation of wealth is more important than the accumulation of <em>knowledge</em>. Here in New York, we embrace the realness life has to offer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081210/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/must_love_imagination.php">blemishes and all</a>. And we&apos;re not even smug about it.</p>

<p>Here we emerge from our tiny closet apartments, and breathe in whatever smell the people of New York curated for us over night. It&apos;s always so different, so bold. In restaurants we squeeze in right next to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081210/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/restaurant_seating_rant.php">our fellow dining companions</a>; at home we listen to our neighbors playfully try to entertain us with a rendition of Bach&apos;s Bradenburg concertos played entirely by stomping on the floor and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081210/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/08/how_the_noise_gets_made.php">dropping loose change</a>; on the street we are also always close to people and on the subway too and there&apos;s no air... </p>

<p><br>
Oh fuck it; we can live in Malibu for the same price as a shitty studio in Gowanus? If our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081210/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/18/greek_islands_bargains.php">Greek Island commune</a> doesn&apos;t pan out, we&apos;re so in.</p>
