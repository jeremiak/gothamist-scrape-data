He announced the news last night to students of Columbia&apos;s School of Journalism, following the &quot;suspicious package&quot; that was delivered to his office<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232342/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/22/suspicious_package_hits_ny_times_bu.php"> yesterday</a>. Radar wonders if the news will off-set the recent right-leaning columns devoted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232342/http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/09/kristol-defends.html">to Sarah Palin</a>, written by Bill Kristol (who Rosenthal dodged questions about last night), but a bigger question is whether Bono will be able to help keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509232342/http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/10/new-york-times-nyt-running-on-fumes">the sinking Gray Lady</a> afloat?</p>
