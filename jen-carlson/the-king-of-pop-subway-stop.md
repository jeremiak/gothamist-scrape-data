City Councilwoman Letitia James <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141206075344/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08242009/news/regionalnews/jacko_off_tracko_186208.htm">wants a plaque in tribute</a> to the performer placed at Brooklyn&apos;s Hoyt-Schermerhorn station... and has even suggested &quot;Jackson&quot; be added to station name. Okay, well, he did film his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141206075344/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/26/michael_jackson_gallery.php?gallery0Pic=9#gallery">Martin Scorsese-directed &quot;Bad&quot; video</a> there, so maybe it makes sense to put up a dedication, but it seems unlikely that anyone will ever call it the Hoyt-Schermerhorn-Jackson stop. In fact, MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said a tribute of any kind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141206075344/http://wcbstv.com/local/michael.jackson.subway.2.1141681.html">is unlikely</a>. Sounds harsh, but he added that they prohibit station plaques of any kind. Still, James says she&apos;s going to start a petition, &quot;<strong>Having Michael Jackson visit and moonwalk at this station was a huge deal not only for Brooklyn, but all of New York in the &apos;80s. And renaming this station in his honor would put it on the map and help ensure that people don&apos;t forget.</strong>&quot; If that doesn&apos;t happen, maybe we can just all think of the JMZ line (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141206075344/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/z_train.php">sans Z</a>) as the MJ line from now on. </p>
