<p>Doesn&apos;t <em>anyone</em> have HBO anymore? Writer Jonathan Ames has penned a new series for the network, called <em>Bored to Death</em>, and even he can&apos;t watch it! The show is set in Brooklyn, where Ames resides... and last night the author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116154546/http://twitter.com/JonathanAmes">took to Twitter</a> to find a tube to watch it on. Some kind strangers took him in, and aside from a few grammatical errors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116154546/http://twitter.com/JonathanAmes/status/4992294391">while Tweeting</a> that Ames called himself out for, he seemed to enjoy the experience. Maybe next Sunday he&apos;ll bring <em>you</em> a bottle of vino and his wisdom on how to perfectly illuminate your living room to view his show.
