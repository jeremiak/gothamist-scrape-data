Tickets already cost $500 to $10,000--and even though the latter are still available, scalpers are hiking up the prices to as much as $25,000! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063606/http://campaignsilo.firedoglake.com/2008/10/06/springsteen-and-billy-joel-benefit-a-very-hot-ticket/">The Campaign Silo</a> reports that ticket scalping breaks campaign finance laws, and &quot;fans who use scalpers could be complicit.&quot; David Donnelly of Campaign Money Watch explained, &quot;If someone purchases tickets for the express purpose of reselling them rather than to make a contribution to Obama or the DNC, they appear to be breaking the law.&quot; There are other ins and outs to the legality of ticket purchases, but the only legal way to do so is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611063606/https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/Oct16Concert">through Obama&apos;s website</a>. The show, at the Hammerstein Ballroom, is one day after the final presidential debate, and it&apos;s rumored that Obama himself may make an appearance. </p>
