<p><em>Making A Murderer</em> is the latest Netflix series to grip the nation&#x2014;the documentary, which has been packaged up into 10 episodes, follows more than a decade in the life of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050335/http://laist.com/tags/makingamurderer">Steven Avery</a> of Manitowoc County, WI. </p>

<p>Avery was wrongfully imprisoned for 18 <em>years</em> on a sexual assault charge, and released when evidence proved his innocence. Two years after his release, in 2005, Avery was charged with the murder of Teresa Halbach, which he is still serving time for, along with his nephew Brendan Dassey (charged with first-degree intentional homicide). Whether or not you believe Avery and Dassey are guilty, the show is an infuriating look at the failures of our criminal justice system, with special prosecutor Ken Kratz as its fatalistic antagonist.</p>

<p>Kratz is a former Wisconsin DA who headed the investigation and prosecution of Avery and Dassey. He resigned in 2010 after being accused of sexting and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050335/http://jezebel.com/5788650/the-sexting-das-matchcom-messages">harassing domestic violence victims</a>. Last week, I emailed him in hopes of securing an interview, and with some persistence, I eventually got him in a room with comedian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050335/https://twitter.com/JenaFriedman">Jena Friedman</a>, who has been vocal about the show on social media. Below is the result&#x2014;you&apos;ll hear Kratz discuss the series, the sexting, and his astrology sign. Friedman also presents him with a Ouija board...</p>
