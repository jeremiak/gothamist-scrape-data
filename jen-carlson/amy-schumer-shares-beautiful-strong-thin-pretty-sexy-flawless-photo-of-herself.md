<p>Recently Annie Leibovitz got together with a bunch of other bad-ass women to photograph them for the 2016 Pirelli Calendar. Patti Smith, Yoko Ono, Serena Williams, Kathleen Kennedy, Amy Schumer, and more.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151351/http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a32204/pirelli-calendar-launch-2016/">Elle explains</a> that the famous calendar launched in 1964, and &quot;has been known to feature the world&apos;s top models, mostly nude, captured by renowned photographers.&quot; For her take, Leibovitz said she wanted to do a bit of a departure, focusing on &quot;real women&quot; (Kathleen Kennedy&apos;s words), not the airbrushed amazons created by an industry that&apos;s manufactured impossible beauty standards.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151351/http://pirellicalendar.pirelli.com/en/the-cal-2016/home">a video</a> giving a behind-the-scenes look at the shoot, Schumer says, &quot;I felt I looked more beautiful than I&apos;ve ever felt in my life, and I felt like it looked like me.&quot; She also Tweeted her photo, along with the words: &quot;Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman.&quot;</p>

<p>Can we put her on all the magazine covers, and the $1 bill, and make her Editor in Chief of <em>Vogue</em>, and embed her voice in every insecure female&apos;s brain?</p>
