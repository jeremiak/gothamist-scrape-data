<p>Did you know that Burger King is the #3 burger chain in the country, with McDonald&apos;s and Wendy&apos;s both surpassing its success? To fight its way back to the top, the fast food supplier has been offering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135212/https://bkdelivers.com/#!menu">delivery services</a> at some of their stores, because they obviously have a perfect understanding of their demo. Now they&apos;ve started rolling out the service in New York City&#x2014;according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135212/https://bkdelivers.com/#!areas">their current list</a> six stores are already delivering, and seven more are set to start delivering soon, all in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>

<p>Their press release states there will be a minimum order of $10, and delivery hours will be between 11 a.m. until 10 p.m.&#x2014;meaning you will not be able to get breakfast items. You also won&apos;t be able to order in fountain beverages, shakes, soft serve desserts, or coffee. </p>

<p>Bonus? Signing up for the delivery service automatically enrolls you in the BK&#x2122; Loyalty Program, where you will receive a free sandwich after every fourth order, and a complimentary etching of a WHOPPER&#xAE; on your tombstone.
