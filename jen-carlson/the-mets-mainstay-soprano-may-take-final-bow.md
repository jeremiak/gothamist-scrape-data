<p>Swenson told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180509/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/arts/music/05ruth.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">the NY Times</a>, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hurtful. I&#x2019;m a New Yorker. I&#x2019;ve sung here for many, many years. I&#x2019;ve had great success. I&#x2019;ve never let them down. It&#x2019;s so stressful to get up onstage and realize that the top guy doesn&#x2019;t like you, and there&#x2019;s nothing I can do about it. Nothing.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The man in charge is first-year general manager Peter Gelb, who has been working 	arduously to get his stamp on the company. He has, however, disputed that her career at the Met is over - though they have not booked her for any future engagements. Denying that age or weight influenced his decision to focus on new talent, her bland performances were cited as a reason for change. </p>

<p>Her latest role as Cleopatra at the Met is one that helped make Beverly Sills a star, so one would imagine that if she can shine during this, while still suffering the after-effects of chemotherapy, Gelb would keep her on. In the meantime, she has engagements next season in Venice, San Francisco, Cincinnati and Dallas, and at the New York City Opera. &#x201C;Giulio Cesare&quot; begins Tuesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180509/http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/production.aspx?id=8992">tickets on sale here</a> (note she will be replaced by her understudy during the last two weeks). </p>
