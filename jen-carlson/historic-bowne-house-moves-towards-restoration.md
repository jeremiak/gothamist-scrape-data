<p>The 17-century Bowne house in Flushing, Queens is <em>finally</em> getting restored after ownership was transferred to the city; news that comes with much relief to Landmark nerds and historians (and anyone who hates to see beautiful old structures disintegrate in front of their very eyes). With $5 million from the city, state and private groups, Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe announced the plan to restore it is moving &quot;full speed ahead,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929121555/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/09/30/2009-09-30_full_speed_ahead_on_rehab_of_famed_bowne_house.html">the Daily News</a>.</p>

<p>Benepe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929121555/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/city-acquires-flushings-bowne-house/">noted</a> that &quot;the Bowne family has also left its mark on the city again and again, helping New York City become the cradle of tolerance and diversity.&quot; The house is looked at as a symbol of religious freedom; the original owner John Bowne was arrested in 1662 for allowing Quakers to worship there (the faith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929121555/http://www.bownehouse.org/flushing_remonstrance.htm">was banned</a> at the time under New Amsterdam law).</p>

<p>The home is the oldest structure in the borough, and Benepe says they will even build a visitor&apos;s center next to it; all in all he&apos;s hoping to have it all done by 2012. He stated, &quot;We probably have a pretty good shot.&quot; Convincing!</p>
