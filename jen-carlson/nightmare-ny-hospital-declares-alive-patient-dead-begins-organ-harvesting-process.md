<p>Second only to being buried alive, this is definitely on the Worst Fear list: being declared dead <em>when you are totally alive</em> and having no way of letting anyone know. That is what happened to one woman at Syracuse&apos;s St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital Health Center. </p>

<p>In 2009, Colleen S. Burns was a patient in the hospital after suffering from a drug overdose. In short, Burns was believed to be dead, and when a nurse did tests that showed she may be alive, the results were ignored. The signs? Burns was able to breath independent from a respirator, her foot moved during a scratch test, <em>and</em> her lips and tongue moved. But her family was told she was dead, and they agreed to let doctors remove her organs. It wasn&apos;t until she was on the table for the organ-harvesting procedure that she opened her eyes, and doctors shut it down. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929031114/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/st_joes_fined_over_dead_patien.html">Syracuse.com</a>, &quot;The hospital&apos;s mishandling of the case was part of the reason the state Health Department fined St. Joe&apos;s $22,000 last September&#x2014;the largest fine levied against a Central New York hospital since 2002.&quot; But Burns and her family never sued the hospital, and her mother said she was never upset about the incident, adding, &quot;She was so depressed that it really didn&apos;t make any difference to her.&quot; She ended up committing suicide in January of 2011.</p>
