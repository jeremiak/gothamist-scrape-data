<p>Was it normal for baseball players to drink beer and smoke cigarettes in the dugout? Here&apos;s a photo from LIFE magazine&apos;s archive, showing Lou Gehrig doing just that in 1936; three years later he would leave the Yankees after being diagnosed with a degenerative muscle disease that would come to be known as &quot;Lou Gehrig&apos;s Disease.&quot; (Incidentally, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161024185234/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41586560/ns/health-health_care/t/smoking-linked-lou-gehrigs-disease/">recently linked</a> to smoking.)</p>
