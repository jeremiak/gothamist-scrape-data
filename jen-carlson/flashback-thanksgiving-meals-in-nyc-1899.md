</div></div>					<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201318/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/11/thanksgiving_guide.php">a lot of options</a> for dining out in the city this Thanksgiving, but none of them cost just 75 cents. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201318/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/a-thanksgiving-dinner-menu-from-1899/">Ephemeral NY</a> looks back at the Thanksgiving menu from 1899 at the Sturtevant House, a popular hotel on Broadway and 29th Street (which was in operation from 1871 to 1903). As you can see by comparison, 75 cents for the whole meal was a pretty good deal&#x2014;you could only get an entree for that much at The Plaza on the same night.</p>
