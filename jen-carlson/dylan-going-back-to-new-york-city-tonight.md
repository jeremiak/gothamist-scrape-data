Will Dylan be returning to one of his old stomping grounds? There seems to be some uncertainty about him living <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135933/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2005/08/did_bob_dylan_r.php">in Brooklyn Heights</a>. While he alluded to spending time there (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135933/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights,_Brooklyn#Notable_residents">allegedly</a> at &quot;Capulet&apos;s, the late-lamented Brooklyn Heights cafe&quot;) and even mentioned living there in his song <em>Tangled Up in Blue</em> (&quot;I lived with them on Montague Street/In a basement down the stairs/There was music in the cafes at night/And revolution in the air&quot;), he could have very well just been crashing at a friend&apos;s pad. Although, he <em>is</em> listed as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135933/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights,_Brooklyn#Notable_residents">notable resident</a> on the ever-so-reliable Wikipedia. Former resident or not, this is his first concert in New York City in two years.</p>
