										<p>There are few traditions better than the firefighter calendar... and the 2011 City of the Brave calendar has arrived! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152047/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2010/08/18/2010-08-18_fdny_bravest_dare_to_bare_all_for_smoking_hot_2011_city_of_the_brave_calendar.html">the Daily News</a>, this is different than the official FDNY calendar, but who doesn&apos;t need more than one calendar? Photographer Katherine Kostreva created the City of the Brave one after firefighters saved her life, and the 26-year-old has since &quot;made it her artistic mission to honor the firemen&apos;s selfless bravado and their muscular bodies.&quot; Meet those muscular bodies at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152047/http://www.facebook.com/pages/City-of-the-Brave-Firefighters-of-NYC/82846974677#!/event.php?eid=142357702454941&amp;ref=share">the launch party</a> at Red Sky Bar (47 East 29th Street) tomorrow at 8 p.m. And in the interest of being fair, here&apos;s a peek at the official FDNY calendar boys. You&apos;re welcome:</p>
