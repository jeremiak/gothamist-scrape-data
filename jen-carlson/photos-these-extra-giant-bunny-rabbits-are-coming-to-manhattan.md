<p>We may never get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170206062909/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/12/what_if_mr_darcy_was_in_the_east_ri.php">Mr. Darcy in the East River</a>, but Australian artist Amanda Parer&apos;s supersized rabbits are stopping by NYC on their four-city national tour. As long as you don&apos;t suffer from anything resembling Leporiphobia, you&apos;re gonna love it.</p>

<p>Parer&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170206062909/http://www.artsbrookfield.com/event/intrude-2/">Intrude</a>&quot;&#x2014;which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170206062909/http://dcist.com/2016/02/photos_giant_luminescent_bunnies_un.php">already hit D.C.</a>&#x2014;is a light sculpture featuring &quot;monumental rabbits, each sewn in white nylon, inflated and internally lit.&quot; They&apos;ll be installed at Brookfield Place (230 Vesey Street) from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170206062909/http://www.artsbrookfield.com/event/intrude-2/">April 17th through 30th</a>.</p>

<p>Since we&apos;re in NYC, where space is limited, we only get 7 (of 17) giant rabbits, &quot;two of which are extra giant in size and were specially commissioned by Arts Brookfield for the NYC launch,&quot; we were told. These scale over two-stories in height, with one approximately 39 feet high and the other 39 feet long. </p>

<p>Debra Simon, vice president and artistic director of Arts Brookfield, says Parer&apos;s &quot;larger-than-life rabbit sculptures are a visually arresting social commentary.&quot; That commentary is meant to reflect, Parer hopes, &quot;how our actions impact the environment.&#x201D; And how rabbits are the most adorable pest in the world? The press release notes they &quot;have caused a great imbalance to the country&apos;s natural and delicately balanced ecosystems, and are considered an invasive pest.&quot; Well, better than <a href="gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bed_bug_or_creme_brulee.php">bed bugs</a>.</p>
