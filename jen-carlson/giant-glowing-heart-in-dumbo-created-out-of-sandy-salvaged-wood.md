                            <p>Yesterday afternoon a new sculpture rose from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006163047/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/26/triangle.php">Pearl Street Triangle</a> in DUMBO, after leaving its previous home in Times Square. The heart-shaped installation was created out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006163047/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>-salvaged wooden planks, and was brought together by the DUMBO Improvement District, Situ Studio, and the New York City Department of Transportation.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006163047/http://www.dumbo.is/blog_posts/heartwalk-spreads-the-love-at-the-pearl-street-triangle">Heartwalk</a> is &quot;a massive 30-foot art installation made from Sandy-salvaged wood&quot; that wil be in place through April 30th, viewable not only from the ground in Brooklyn, but also from the Manhattan Bridge bicycle lane. Visitors are encouraged to interact with the piece, which lights up red, as they stand in the center of the heart. <br>
 <br>
Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz spoke about the installation, saying, &quot;Brooklynites have enormous heart, and that was never more true than following Hurricane Sandy, when thousands of our residents came to the aid of fellow Brooklynites and New Yorkers. So DUMBO&#x2014;and all of Brooklyn&#x2014;is thrilled to open our hearts to the installation... crafted from boardwalk wood salvaged from Sandy&#x2019;s aftermath.&quot;<br>
 <br>
But when will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006163047/http://gothamist.com/tags/stabberalley">Stabber Alley</a> get an installation?</p>
