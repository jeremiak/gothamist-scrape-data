On top of that: </p>

<ul><li>65% hate that you share too many mundane updates too often
</li><li>46% dislike that you &quot;Like&quot; too many posts
</li><li>40% don&apos;t like it when you inappropriately or too frequently use Facebook to promote causes
</li><li>40% wish you would stop projecting false information or images of a perfect life</li></ul>

<p>Also, stop stalking, stop being a drama queen, stop talking about your kids, stop documenting your lunches, stop being a poser, and stop airbrushing your photos. </p>
