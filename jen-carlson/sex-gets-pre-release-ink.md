The ink&apos;s been bought by the barrell to promote this release, and even columnist Carrie Bradshaw herself never penned this many words about s-e-x during her career. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145258/http://nymag.com/movies/profiles/46660">NYMag</a> starts things off chatting with the star, Sarah Jessica Parker, in what translates into a seven-page piece. For those who blame SJP for the bus-loads of transplants infiltrating Manhattan and transforming the cityscape, you should know her husband agrees with you.</p><blockquote>Parker and Broderick keep a running count of these changes, a mutual mourning for the transformation of their neighborhood into a luxe, tree-lined shopping mall. She knows this sounds absurd coming from her, that <strong>people blame <em>Sex and the City</em> for the ruination of the West Village; even Broderick says, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s your fault!</strong>&#x201D;</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145258/http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-sex0505,0,7558435.story">amNewYork</a> follows with the sentiment that <em>Sex and the City</em> is to blame for the influx of Carries coming to town. The cast defends themselves, though they can&apos;t deny that their stoops are being replaced with 40-story buildings.<blockquote>&quot;When people come up to me on the street and say, &apos;<strong>I just got here from Iowa two weeks ago. Your show made me come.</strong> I&apos;m like, &apos;Oh no,&apos;&quot; said Nixon, who plays reprising Miranda Hobbes. &quot;People do come here looking for love, but what do they find?&quot;</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145258/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/02/sjp_warns_futur.php">Most recently</a> SJP told her fawning fanbase that Brooklyn was the new &quot;place to be&quot;, despite the show shunning it when it ran on HBO. Meanwhile, over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145258/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/movies/moviesspecial/04bell.html?ref=movies">The NY Times</a>, director Michael Patrick King focused on another rumor surrounding the movie. Spoiler alert?! No one&apos;s gonna kick the bucket with their Manolo-clad feet in the film.<blockquote>&quot;You don&apos;t know how many people came up to me when I was making the movie and said, &apos;So is somebody going to die?&apos; Yup. Happy summer. Thanks for your $10. Enjoy your Diet Coke. <strong>Someone&apos;s going to die. Like that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to do.</strong>&quot;</blockquote>They&apos;ll undoubtedly save <em>that</em> plotline for the sequel.<p></p>
