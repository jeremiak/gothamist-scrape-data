<p>In the video below some dogs attempt to recreate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410035616/http://gothamist.com/tags/wesanderson">Wes Anderson</a>&apos;s film <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>... very poorly. We know, they&apos;re just dogs, but let&apos;s all agree that cats&#x2014;having a deeper understanding of the universe and a stronger disposition&#x2014;would have done a better job. They at least would have pandered less. To put it simply, Anderson&apos;s style goes deeper than quirky wallpaper, a distinguished color palette, and a no-fuss font&#x2014;and that&apos;s about all we get in this cheap parody, which barely tries to grasp his narrative style. Here the story is watered down into simple &quot;dad issues,&quot; and you get the sense these dogs didn&apos;t really understand their roles, nor did they grasp the awkwardness of raw humanity necessary to successfully deliver their lines. </p>

<p>Also, what are Max Fischer and Sam from <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> doing here?</p>

<p>Terrible job, dogs. Just terrible. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410035616/http://laughingsquid.com/the-regal-tenenbones-a-parody-of-wes-andersons-the-royal-tenenbaums-starring-dogs/">Laughing Squid</a>]</p>
