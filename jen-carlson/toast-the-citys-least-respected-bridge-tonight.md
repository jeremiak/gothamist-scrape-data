</div></div>					<p>Did you know the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403184642/http://gothamist.com/tags/manhattanbridge">Manhattan Bridge</a> has been known, to some, as the Rodney Dangerfield of our city&apos;s bridges since the 1980s? Today, 100 years after it officially opened, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403184642/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/nyregion/31bridge.html?hp">the NY Times</a> profiles why the structure gets no respect.</p>

<p>The city has spent $830 million on repairing the bridge in just the last 20 years &#x2014; perhaps one of the reasons no re-enactment of the opening day ceremonies is planned. Upon its opening, the mayor at the time, George B. McClellan Jr., led &#x201C;a little cavalcade of automobiles and carriages&quot; across the bridge. But the current secretary of the bridge commission, M. Barry Schneider, says there&apos;s no big ceremony to mark the occasion, though they are &quot;emailing everyone who had had a hand in its work, urging a toast to the bridge at 9 p.m.&quot; He notes they celebrated the 100 year anniversary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403184642/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/manhattan_bridge_turns_100_this_sun.php">back in October</a>, and adds that the bridge wasn&apos;t even really completed on December 31st all those years ago; once the mayor finished his ceremonial ride, he declared: &quot;Now finish the damn bridge,&quot; though perhaps a bit more eloquently.</p>

<p>One of the major engineering flaws was that the subway tracks were placed on the outside, not the middle of the bridge &#x2014;&#xA0;this used to cause the bridge to drop four to six feet whenever a subway went over it (now it&apos;s a bit less... phew!). And of course there&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403184642/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/24/video_manhattan_bridge_sways.php">that beautiful sway</a>, caught on time lapse &#x2014; if nothing else, toast to this at 9 p.m. tonight:</p>
