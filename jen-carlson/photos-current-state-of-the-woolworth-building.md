</div></div><p>The absolutely gorgeous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145304/http://www.nyc-architecture.com/SCC/SCC019.htm">Woolworth Building</a> has been undergoing a fairly sluggish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145304/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/realestate/commercial/30woolworth.html">renovation</a>. Following the attacks on 9/11, the building was without electricity, water and telephone service for weeks, and now the former tourist attraction has a sign on the door that reads: &quot;Tourists Are Not Permitted Beyond This Point.&quot; Flickr user <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145304/http://www.flickr.com/photos/yojimbot">yojimbot</a> somehow got inside, however, and just sent over these photos.</p>
