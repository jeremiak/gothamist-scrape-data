</div></div>					<p>Kensington Stables owner Walker Blankinship made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520024404/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/09/stable_owner_says_new_regulations_w.php">a big stink</a> about new regulations that would mandate he give his horses 5-weeks of vacation, as well as add bigger stalls and install a sprinkler system in his barn. He threatened to close his business, which offers $37 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520024404/http://www.kensingtonstables.com/trailrides/index.htm">trail rides</a> through Prospect Park, if he was made to follow the newly proposed rules. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520024404/http://brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/12/33_12_sb_kensington_stables.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> reports that the Board of Health has sided with him&#x2014;they decided against changing the horse-boarding laws, thus allowing Kensington Stables to remain open, as is.</p>

<p>The reforms are now being focused solely on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520024404/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">carriage horse industry</a>, but the paper notes that Blankinship is keeping an eye on the legislation, currently headed towards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520024404/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/13/changes_proposed_for_carriage_horse.php">City Council</a> (perhaps because he also also offers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520024404/http://www.kensingtonstables.com/carriagerides/index.htm">carriage rides</a>).</p>

<p>Area politicians have also sided with the stable owner, and a spokeswoman for Brad Lander  (D-Park Slope) says, &#x201C;We hope that the [Kensington] stables will be exempted [from any pending Council bill].&quot; For now, Blankinship doesn&apos;t need to change a thing&#x2014;the Board of Health only required that he vaccinate his horses for rabies, which he had already done.</p>
