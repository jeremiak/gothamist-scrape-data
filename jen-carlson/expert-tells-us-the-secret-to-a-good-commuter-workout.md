<p>Sitting is killing us all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160620223952/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/29/the_truth_about_sitting_down_its_ki.php">that much we know</a>. &quot;Sitting 6+ hours per day makes you up to 40% likelier to die within 15 years than someone who sits less than 3. Even if you exercise.&quot; Need more convincing? Here are some of those scaremongering illustrations for you:</p>

<p>But how can we combat the evils of such a stationary life? If you sit down most of the day at your job, fitness guru and personal trainer at the Reebok Sports Club in NYC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160620223952/http://melissaparisfitness.com/index.php/melissa_paris">Melissa Paris</a>, has some tips for you.</p>

<p><strong>Can a New Yorker work out on their subway or bus commute&#x2014;how?</strong>  Obviously doing jumping jacks at 6 p.m. on a crowded subway isn&apos;t what I&apos;m talking about. But doing things like standing instead of sitting, especially if you have been at a desk all day, can burn more calories.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us about a good Commuter Workout routine.</strong> Even if you have 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening 3 days a week you can improve your posture, then your core, and feel better about your health. Start or end each day with: 3 sets 10-15 push-ups, 3 sets of 20 squats, 3 sets of 30-60 second planks, 3 sets of 1 minute wall sits.</p>

<p><strong>What are other ways New Yorkers can get some exercise and strengthening in during their daily routine?</strong> Walk to a further subway stop or get off a stop early and walk a few blocks more. Taking the stairs whenever possible.</p>

<p><strong>Many of us sit for 8-10, if not longer, hours a day&#x2014;how can someone realistically combat the terrible effects this has on a body?</strong> Instead of ordering lunch to be delivered, leave your desk and get it yourself. Walk around a full block right after eating to give your food a chance to digest. Every 3 hours stand up stretch. Set alarm reminders to move around even if it means visiting a co worker on another floor. Instead of emailing every question/answer to your colleague walk over to their desk and have a conversation.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="yogaciseoffice.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160620223952im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/yogaciseoffice.jpeg" width="640" height="185" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><strong>How much time in a day should be dedicated to movement of some kind?</strong> At least 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>What exercises can someone do at an office job without their coworkers thinking they&apos;re crazy?</strong> Taking the stairs, making a point to get out of your chair every 10 minutes, stetting your hips by putting your right ankle by left knee and hold for 30 seconds and switch, stitch your arms and torso by holding the back of chair and twisting to each side hold for 30 seconds each.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a best time of the day to work out?</strong> I always say the time of day you either feel your best or that fits in your schedule. There is no best time it&apos;s the best time for you.</p>

<p><strong>For the average person, what&apos;s the best kind of workout (yoga, spinning, or what should someone be doing if they have a gym membership)?</strong> For my clients that have desk jobs I incorporate or suggest classes or exercises that require as much standing as possible. Putting someone back in a sitting position reinforces tight hip flexors, lower back tightness, and your shoulders to rotate forward. Good examples of workouts are zumba, boxing, yoga, and total body conditioning classes.</p>
