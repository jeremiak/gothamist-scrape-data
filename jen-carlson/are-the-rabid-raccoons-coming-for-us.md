Their warning stemmed from having <em>serious intel</em> on at least three rabid raccoons in the area. They warned New Yorkers to stay away from any raccoons, skunks, bats, stray dogs and cats&#x2014;because the rabies could be spreading and we&apos;d pretty much be looking at an <em>I Am Legend</em> scale outbreak if it crossed over to humans. (The last human case of rabies in the city was back in 1953.)<p></p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030305/http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/29/central.park.rabies/index.html">CNN reports</a> that authorities and medical experts warned the public yesterday that a rabies outbreak in Central Park <em>could</em> spread from raccoons to humans... and that there are now at least 28 rabid raccoons in the area! </p>

<p>For their part, the DoH is working with the Parks Department to increase surveillance and vaccinate wild raccoons in Central Park, Morningside Park and Riverside Park. One expert told them: &quot;Urban ecosystems sometimes have the ideal measures. When you get an infectious agent like rabies, it tends to have these untoward effects, meaning an outbreak.&quot; In other words: we are screwed, because there are no predators taking these suckers out.</p>
