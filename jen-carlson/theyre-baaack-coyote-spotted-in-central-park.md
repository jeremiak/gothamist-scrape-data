<p>Last year there were plenty of coyotes spotted around the city, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195909/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/23/coyote_1.php">a few in Central Park</a>, so it&apos;s not surprising that we just got an alert about another one spotted in the area. We&apos;ve received word that a coyote was reported in Central Park between West 77th Street and West 81st Street, sometime over the past half hour. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427195909/http://twitter.com/#!/CBS2ThisMorning/status/129556373812940800">CBS</a> is also confirming that the NYPD has reported a coyote on the loose in that area. We&apos;ll update with more information when we have it... be safe out there!</p>
