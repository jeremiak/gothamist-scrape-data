Offering up a haunting new take on folk rock, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209091450/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/tracks/05-10-07.shtml">Pitchfork</a> calls it the perfect music to be remixed. And remixed it has been, on November 8th their cd <em>Horn of Plenty</em> will be re-released as a double disc with a new twist. Their songs, remixed or au natural, are for soundtracking your urban walks and sleepy bedtime conversations - if forced to, we&apos;d coin it as bewilderock. Check them out as they open for the Moutain Goats at the Knitting Factory this Halloween (more details after the interview). </p>

<p><strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
one part ex boyfriend, one part thought the name was funny</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
Being really confused and baffled by the real estate market of 1999 and wondering how on earth I was ever going to find a place I could live in and afford. Eventually I just ended up living way too far uptown for my own good.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite/least favorite memory involving New York?</strong><br>
Aside from historical obvious choices, my least favorite memory would probably be having to spend a night in a bushwick hospital surrounded by feces and piss (for real) in the waiting room after having had no sleep for 2 days. Runner Up: NYU freshman in the elevator talking about Sex in the City.<br>
Favorite: croquet in prospect park with bloody marys</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out?</strong><br>
Wow. This has changed so much. I still miss the old hole on wednesdays. Nothing quite like that out there now, at least in my eyes. At the moment I&apos;ve gone a bit domestic, but I guess I&apos;d still say wednesdays are great for going out, especially if you are looking for free drinks. Favorite bar? I&apos;m loyal to Enids and my neighborhood polish bar Irene&apos;s</p>
