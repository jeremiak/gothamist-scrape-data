The rapper was busted outside of hotspot Lotus last Wednesday for marijuana possession, and was issued a desk appearance ticket. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://www.nypost.com/seven/02232008/gossip/pagesix/pizza__no_pot_98866.htm">The Post</a> reports that didn&apos;t stop Snoop from partying the very next night, with his 25-strong posse, at Serafina and the tapas lounge Lollipop (somewhere in between they ordered 15 pizzas, so we&apos;re guessing there <em>may</em> have been some weed around that night, too!). During one of the BET interviews, he claimed the accusation was &quot;bogus&quot;. </p>

<p>His lawyer, Donald Etra, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://www.pr-inside.com/snoop-in-legal-trouble-again-r452616.htm">says</a> they are &quot;contesting the ticket&quot; (perhaps his defense should include a quote from Snoop&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://www.metrolyrics.com/new-york-lyrics-snoop-dogg.html">song</a> about the city: &quot;And everything in New York ain&apos;t always what it seems&quot;). Snoop isn&apos;t unfamiliar with the legal process, having a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg#Legal_issues">long history</a> of run-ins with the law. His last charge was for carrying-on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=c42fedf5-fca4-446d-a2fc-2be77eb91339">a collapsible baton</a> on a flight in 2006, something he ended up paying for with a community service sentence and three years of probation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://www.nme.com/news/snoop-dogg/25669">Earlier this year</a> he was tangled up in a legal battle over &quot;Snooperbowl.&quot;</p>

<p>Harkening back to happier times, prior to his trip over to the East Coast he took Larry King for chicken and waffles at LA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://www.roscoeschickenandwaffles.com/">Roscoe&apos;s</a>, witness the unlikely pair getting ready to chow down, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124521/http://gawker.com/5002807/snoop-and-larry-kings-fried-chicken-date-surprisingly-charming">here</a>.</p>
