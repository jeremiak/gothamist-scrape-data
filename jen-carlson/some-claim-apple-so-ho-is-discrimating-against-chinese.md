One Queens assemblywoman, Grace Meng, says some of the shop&apos;s employees are, and has written a letter to the company demanding an explanation. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131023155134/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2010/05/07/2010-05-07_untitled__2apple07m.html">the Daily News</a>, Meng says she was approached by a handful of customers making claims they were denied an iPad because they were Chinese. <p></p>

<p>Allegedly these customers were asked for passports, asked inappropriate questions, and &quot;one person was asked why they wanted one since their English was not so good.&quot; A 33-year-old man from Queens says he was told by one worker that they were out of iPads, then an Asian employee found him one, but a manager then asked him if he was planning on reselling the gadget. He spoke to the paper anonymously, saying, &quot;I&apos;m just so upset. This is racial profiling.&quot; Apple has yet to comment on the allegations.</p>
