<span class="photo_caption">Can you tell the real Gaga from the fake Gaga?</span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141105111303/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/video_gaga_surprises_band_in_union.php">Earlier today</a> we picked up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141105111303/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/03/_lady_gaga_just_made_an_indie.html">Washington Post</a> story about Lady Gaga showing up at Union Square to see a band perform her song &quot;Born This Way&quot;... but now the paper has updated their story to say it has not been confirmed that this was the <em>real</em> Fame Monster (and a commenter mentioned the woman in the video is actually an impersonator named Darcy). Let&apos;s go to the photos...</p>

<p> On the right we have a photo of the &quot;Lady Gaga&quot; that showed up in Union Square&#x2014;something is off: those fake pearl earrings, the animal print top... PANTS? This isn&apos;t the Gaga we know, and it&apos;s especially not the Gaga that shows up at publicity stunts. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the real Gaga transmitted that photo on the left to her fans via Twitter on Sunday. Long hair, black bangs... something isn&apos;t right here. Our Scooby sense is telling us the band involved in this stunt is lying, and therefore even worse than we originally thought. While they haven&apos;t copped to it, someone on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141105111303/http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-Love-Monsters/48315414498">their Facebook</a> pointed out that the Gaga that showed up was indeed an impersonator. Meanwhile, the band has started another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141105111303/http://twitter.com/#!/i_love_monsters/status/40988590355783680">Twitter campaign</a> to get on Carson Daly&apos;s show...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Washington Post has another update on their story, writing, &quot;Despite his comments on Wednesday, Jonathan Tortora wrote in an e-mail Thursday afternoon: &apos;As a band, we thought it was pretty obvious that the video was staged and agreed that when talking to any media outlets we would neither deny nor confirm the truth&#x2014;deflecting questions about Gaga to talking about the band and all of our other endeavors.&apos;&quot; </p>
