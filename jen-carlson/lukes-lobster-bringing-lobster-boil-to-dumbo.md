<p>It&apos;s like summer never ended! On Saturday, October 26th, Luke&apos;s Lobster is hosting a fundraiser&#x2014;in the form of a lobster boil&#x2014;for the Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy. This is their first time going Full Lobster, and they&apos;ll be offering whole steamed lobsters, corn, potatoes, slaw, blueberry cake, hot cider, and iced tea-lemonade <a href="www.lukeslobster.com/shop/lobsterboil">with each $40 ticket</a>. They&apos;ll also have Peak Organic beer on hand (sold separately for $5 a pop). But we were curious about that blueberry cake, so Ben Conniff sent us along a photo (saying, &quot;We tried a lot of different options. That was a tough day at the office.&quot;): </p>

<p>The event will go down in Pier 1 (near their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505162002/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/lukes_lobster_opening_in_adorable_b.php">new adorable little outpost</a>), where you&apos;ll also get some live music during the festivities. BUT THAT&apos;S NOT ALL, you&#x2019;ll even get a free Luke&#x2019;s Lobster koozie (to keep your hands warm while you&apos;re enjoying that bottled beer) <em>and</em> popcorn sprinkled with Luke&apos;s secret seasoning.</p>
