Currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604004429/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343092/">the IMDB page</a> lists the following actors as being attached to the latest redux, though some are only rumored: Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, and Hayley Atwell as Jordan Baker. But who should really play the parts of F. Scott&apos;s famous characters? Click through for possible contenders, and below is the trailer for the 1974 version: </p>
