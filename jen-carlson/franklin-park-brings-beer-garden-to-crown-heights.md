<p>Southpaw owner Matt Roff is awfully busy opening new bars and venues lately (hopefully not nearby any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302060706/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/29/residents_rise.php">nit-picky neighbors</a>). As he works on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302060706/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/galapagos_moves.php">Galapagos space transformation</a>, he somehow fit in opening up a beer garden last Friday in Crown Heights. </p>

Their website serves up all the details:</p><blockquote>We&apos;re a little less than three blocks away from The Brooklyn Museum and The Brooklyn Botanic Gardens. We&apos;re <strong>open weekdays from 3pm - 2am and weekends from 1pm - 2am</strong>. <p></p>

<p>Currently on draught we&apos;re serving: Coney Island Lager (brooklyn) , Rare Vos Amber Ale (cooperstown, ny), Hoegaarden (belgium), Green Flash IPA (california), Schneider Weisse (germany), Raddelburger (germany), Six Point Righteous (brooklyn), Blue Point Toasted Lager (long island), Original Sin , Jever (germany), O&apos;hara Irish Stout (ireland) and Stone Pale Ale (california).</p></blockquote>Roff tells us, &quot;we will have food in the near future, probably a <strong>BBQ in the yard</strong>, and we&apos;re discussing <strong>roasting marshmallows on a fire pit</strong>.&quot;  <p></p>
