<p>If you aren&apos;t already listening, we recommend checking out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161004/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>&apos;s podcast on WNYC called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161004/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething">Here&apos;s The Thing</a>, a program that comes out twice a month and allows you to listen in on a conversation between Baldwin and his guest. In the past that guest has been anyone from Brian Williams to Lena Dunham to David Brooks to Billy Joel to Dick Cavett, and today the actor is paired up with someone we didn&apos;t really expect: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161004/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2013/apr/01/">Radiohead&apos;s Thom Yorke</a>. </p>

<p>During the course of the nearly hour-long interview, Yorke&#x2014;who doesn&apos;t do <em>too many</em> interviews&#x2014;discusses his relationship with music (then and now), his not-so-great relationship with arena shows, his success, his &quot;bad painting trips,&quot; working with Greenpeace, and being a dad, amongst other things. And then there are charming little moments like this: </p>

<p>Alec Baldwin: How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Thom Yorke: Warp, as in -</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin: Warp, W-A-R-P? Like &#x2018;The floor is warped after the flood?&apos;</p>

<p>Thom Yorke: Yeah.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin: I must say, with your accent that could have been any one of four words. When you said, &#x2018;On this label called Warp.</p>

<p>Thom Yorke: Warp.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin: Warp? Warm? Wall?</p>

<p>Thom Yorke: Warp. Warp.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin: Yeah. [Affects southern accent] Say it like we say it here in the United States.</p>

<p>Thom Yorke: [Affects southern accent] Warp. It&apos;s a County &amp; Western record label.</p></blockquote><p></p>
