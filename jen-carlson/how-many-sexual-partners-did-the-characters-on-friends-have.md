<p>You know that diary you keep hidden in plain sight amongst the books on your bookshelf that contains a list of all of your sexual partners? Do you ever wonder how your number compares to, say, Ross and Rachel&apos;s numbers? No? Well, now you will be able to compare them anyway. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233042/http://www.reddit.com/r/entertainment/comments/15y5tj/characters_in_friends_didnt_have_85_total_sex/">A Redditor</a> has watched every episode of <em>Friends</em> and compiled a list showing how many sexual partners each character has had. Note: 1 point was given for &quot;confirmed sex (either by strong innuendo or plain admission),&quot; and a half point for &quot;Unconfirmed sex (e.g., &apos;I dated a guy&apos;).&quot; And since they all turned 30 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233042/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583489/">in 2001</a>, and the show ended in 2004, they were roughly 33 when these numbers were accurate. </p>

<ul><li>Chandler: 10.5 sex partners
</li><li>Ross: 14 sex partners
</li><li>Monica: 14.5 sex partners
</li><li>Rachel: 15.5 sex partners
</li><li>Phoebe: 32.5 sex partners
</li><li>Joey: 51.5 sex partners</li></ul>

<p>And of course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233042/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/10/nyc_as_seen_on_tv_top_5_worst.php#photo-3">here&apos;s a look at where all the magic happened</a>. </p>

<p>Now who is going to give <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233042/http://gothamist.com/tags/sexandthecity">Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha</a> this treatment?</p>
