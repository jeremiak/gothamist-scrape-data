title: Video Exclusive: Girl Walk // All Day Goes Underground In Chapter 7
---

	
										<p>You knew it was coming: in the latest chapter of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113210635/http://gothamist.com/tags/girlwalkallday">Girl Walk // All Day</a>, the troupe finds themselves on the L train! But before that, there&apos;s a sweet street fight (or a dance-off, if you prefer), and some American Museum of Natural History action. Stay tuned for the release of Chapter 8 next Tuesday, to help you get back into the swing of things after the holiday weekend (spoiler: this one features a shopping spree followed by a trip to Zuccotti Park).</p>
