	<p>In 1971, fearing his plane would crash on the way to or from his trip to Canada, artist Vito Acconci left his apartment keys at the School of Visual Arts&apos; Registrar&apos;s office, and in the event of his death, wrote that &quot;the envelope can be picked up by the first person who calls for it; he will be free to use my apartment, and its contents, any way he wishes.&quot;</p>
