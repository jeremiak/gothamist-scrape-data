</div></div>					<p>In 1932 the artist Lester Gaba, not unlike Andrew McCarthy&apos;s character in the 1987 classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075243/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093493/"><em>Mannequin</em></a>, created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075243/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_%28Gaba_girl%29">Cynthia</a>, a mannequin for Saks Fifth Avenue. Cynthia was &quot;a 100-pound model who had realistic imperfections like freckles, pigeon toes, and even different sized feet.&quot; Five years later, Gaba posed with Cynthia around New York City for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075243/http://www.life.com/gallery/60331/cynthia-world-famous-mannequin#index/0">LIFE magazine</a> spread which supposedly &quot;launched the career of an up-and-coming starlet [and] made Cynthia a household name overnight.&quot;</p>

<p>No, really. She was a legit A-lister, complete with her own television talk show, roles in movies, and a box seat subscription to the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>

<p>A whole fleet of Gaba Girls were created eventually, modeled after well-known New York debutantes for the windows of Best &amp; Company, and mannequins became the &quot;hot new tool for sellers to attract their clientele.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, Cynthia died when she slipped from a chair in a beauty salon and shattered, the press even reported on her death. She was reconstructed and tried to have a comeback much later, in the 1950s, but the appeal was gone and she was stored up in a box. LIFE notes, &quot;Cynthia&apos;s current whereabouts are a mystery.&quot; Creepy!</p>
