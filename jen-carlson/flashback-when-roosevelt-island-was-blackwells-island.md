</div></div>					<p>This 1903 footage was taken on &quot;a boat heading south along the eastern shore of Blackwell&apos;s Island, known as Welfare Island from 1921 to 1973, and as Roosevelt Island today.&quot; According to the YouTube poster: &quot;The film opens showing the lighthouse at the north end of the island (Hallet&apos;s Cove)... the following buildings, in order of appearance, are seen: the New York City Lunatic Asylum [0:39]; the Workhouse; the Almshouse [0:45]; piers for the Queensboro or &apos;59th Street&apos; Bridge still under construction, which upon completion in 1908 will span 135 feet above the island [1:20]; the Almshouse Keeper&apos;s House (originally the home of the Blackwell family, who had once owned the island) [1:30]; the Penitentiary [1:45]; Charity Hospital [1:55].&quot; By the end of the 2:27 clip, you&apos;ll have reached the southern tip of the island.</p>

<p>Prior to being called Blackwell&apos;s Island (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150331110818/http://www.correctionhistory.org/html/chronicl/nycdoc/html/blakwel1.html">the DOC&apos;s island home</a> before Rikers), it was called both Hog and Manning&apos;s Island. The city didn&apos;t purchase it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150331110818/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Island#History_timeline">until 1828</a> (for $32,000). Today, the Blackwell House is the island&apos;s oldest landmark.
