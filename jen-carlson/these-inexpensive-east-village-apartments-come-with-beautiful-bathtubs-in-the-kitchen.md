title: These Inexpensive East Village Apartments Come With Beautiful Bathtubs (In The Kitchen)
---

	
										<p>You know those people who live like it&apos;s the olden times? No, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100731123106AAnJrwP">not the Amish</a>. Those walking Etsy shops of steampunk garbage who pretend it&apos;s Victorian times and make very bold declarations that they do everything as it was done in Victorian times, and yet still somehow show up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-washington-couple-lives-victorian-era/story?id=34920909">on ABC News</a> riding their 19th century bicycles in a corset. Do you think those people ever live in NYC? Because if they do, there are some fantastic apartments available with Victorian-style fixings built right in. </p>

<span class="photo_caption"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/http://www.mns.com/details/222756">328 East 6th Street</a>, Apt 13</span></p>

<p>These apartments (which appear to have been through a nice renovation job recently) have gorgeous old claw foot bathtubs right there in the kitchen area, in unnecessarily close proximity to your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/http://www.oldandinteresting.com/kitchen-antiques.aspx">cherry pitter and pastry jigger</a>. Streeteasy is calling the kitchen-tub <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/http://streeteasy.com/blog/bathtub-in-kitchen/">a &quot;tubchen&quot;</a> now, btw (pause for sigh). Bonus: there&apos;s no elevator in the walk-up buildings, just like Victorian times.</p>

<p>Rent on these two spots are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/http://www.mns.com/details/222756">$1800</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/http://streeteasy.com/building/328-east-6-street-manhattan/12">$1900/month</a>, with the more expensive one also featuring a &quot;tuberculosis window.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023131610/http://evgrieve.com/2016/02/these-charming-east-6th-street-studios.html">EV Grieve</a>]</p>
