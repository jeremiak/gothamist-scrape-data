So, it only makes sense that the character Ted Mosby, who plays an architect-turned-professor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201322/http://www.buzzfeed.com/jpmoore/how-i-met-your-mothers-ted-mosby-has-a-rate-my">has a Rate My Professor page</a>. There are actually a few (over at NYU he&apos;s got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201322/http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1482580">a 4.3</a>), but on the show he teaches at Columbia, where students have given him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201322/http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1348437&amp;page=1">a 4.4</a> for &quot;overall quality.&quot;</p>

<p>There are hundreds of comments on the page for Professor <em>Bro</em>sby, including a nod to the length of the series: &quot;He talks a lot, some of his stories feel like it takes him 7years to tell.&quot;</p>

<p>The show returned with a new episode last night, focusing on Lily and Marshall&apos;s housewarming, but the good news is that the two may be coming back to NYC, after banishing themselves to the Long Island &apos;burbs, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201322/http://www.tvguide.com/News/HIMYM-Spoilers-Sweeps-1042759.aspx?rss=news">TV Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Oh and, Jason Segel, if you ever do film an episode here, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201322/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/a_nyc_sandwich_tour_inspired_by_jas.php">we made you a sandwich tour</a>. It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230201322/http://chicagoist.com/2012/01/09/wrigleyville_girls_youtube_video_sc.php">not a song</a> but <em>it&apos;s all we&apos;ve got</em>.</p>
