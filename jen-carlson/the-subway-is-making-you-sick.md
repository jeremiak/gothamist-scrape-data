While the study was conducted at the University of Nottingham, far from our own MTA, it&apos;s a safe bet that it translates to every public transit system in the world... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170224121456/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/photos_swedens_stunning_subway_stat.php">except Sweden</a>, of course.</p>
