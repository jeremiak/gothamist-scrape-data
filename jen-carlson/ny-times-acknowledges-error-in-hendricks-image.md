<p>It&apos;s been a couple of days since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517182034/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/19/post_131.php">we pointed out</a> that the Gray Lady ran an altered image of Christina Hendricks at the Golden Globes, in an article where writer Cathy Horyn used an anonymous quote to call the actress &quot;big.&quot; Since then, the story has made the rounds, and the Paper of Record has printed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517182034/http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/further-reflections-on-a-golden-i/">an explanation</a>, of sorts, saying: &quot;The photo was slightly distorted inadvertently due to an error during routine processing. The photograph has been replaced.&quot; </p>

<p>Whether or not you believe that the image didn&apos;t catch anyone&apos;s eye at the New York Times before it ran, it was definitely a bit more than &quot;slightly&quot; distorted (which makes it harder to believe this was a &quot;routine processing error&quot;). In case the above side-by-side shots aren&apos;t convincing enough, one reader sent us an animated gif where he &quot;superimposed one of the photos over the other&quot; &#x2014; you can see it after the jump.</p>

<p>So: did a Times intern simply make an &quot;oops&quot; or did Horyn specifically use that image to make some sort of point? We&apos;ll never know. However, <em>we do know</em> that the same paper ran an article on the same day cattily opining that Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox and Kate Hudson had all gained weight in their upper arms. </p>

<p>And not to put the Times&apos;s writers under too much of a microscope (but they&apos;re just so tiny!), we <em>also know</em> that someone at the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517182034/http://twitter.com/themoment/status/7885560073">Twittered</a>, upon seeing Michael C. Hall in a hat at the same awards show: &quot;Is Michael C. Hall playing Bob Marley in an upcoming movie? Don&apos;t get the hat or what he is hiding under it.&quot; Hall, in fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517182034/http://www.usmagazine.com/healthylifestyle/news/nytimes-blog-disses-cancer-patient-michael-c-halls-skull-cap-1970241">is in remission after battling Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma</a>. Unsurprisingly, this is the same Times writer who Twittered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517182034/http://twitter.com/themoment/status/5702162439">asking if Morrissey was dead</a>. And this is the kind of top notch journalism you&apos;ll soon be asked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517182034/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/new_york_times_website_paywall_deta.php">to pay more for</a>!</p>
