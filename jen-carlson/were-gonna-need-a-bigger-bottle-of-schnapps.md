										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="hotdamnschnapps.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174354im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/hotdamnschnapps.jpg" width="110" height="297" class="image-right"> </span>North Dakota&#x2014;home to America&apos;s ugliest (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174354/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/24/map_3.php">allegedly!</a>)&#x2014;has a message for New York: stock up on kitty litter and Schnapps. Langdon, N.D.&apos;s very own Barb Mehlhoff told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174354/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/nyregion/25freeze.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">the NY Times</a> to keep kitty litter in the trunk so if you get stuck you can stick it underneath the tires for traction. Sadly, this does not work on the subway. Some other tips from the small town included eating soup, bundling up (duh!), have a sleeping bag on hand, and lots of chocolate and pretzels (duh, again). But the gem amongst this cold weather advice came in recipe form&#x2014;which we have (named and) provided for you below: </p>

<blockquote><strong>Darlene Brooks&apos;s Spiked Cider</strong>

<p>Hot Apple Cider<br>
DeKuyper&#x2019;s Hot Damn! cinnamon Schnapps (Darlene recommends just a dash but, c&apos;mon)</p>

<p>Mix together, drink, repeat</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Another favorite wintertime drink in Langdon: iced coffee! The owner of an espresso bar on Main Street (<em>aw</em>) said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how to say it. Around here, we&#x2019;re just so used to it.&#x201D; Another local said the cold &quot;keeps the riffraff out. Only the good people stick around.&#x201D; Alright New York, those sound like fightin&apos; words, buck up, <em>we can do this</em>. We&apos;re used to it, too! Pass the Schnapps.</p>
