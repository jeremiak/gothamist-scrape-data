										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="petad1112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211529im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/petad1112.jpeg" width="294" height="375" class="image-right"> </span>PETA&apos;s new ad campaign declares: &quot;Fur Trim: UNATTRACTIVE.&quot; While their real target are people who wear animal fur, their image shows a woman with an unwaxed and unruly bikini line, with the text: &quot;Don&apos;t ruin your look with fur trim,&quot; next to it. Naturally, the animal rights organization is pissing the wrong people off with their misdirected imagery. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211529/http://gothamist.com/tags/amandapalmer">Amanda Palmer</a>, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211529/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/fashion/15skin.html">spoken about body hair</a> before, has written <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429211529/http://amandapalmer.tumblr.com/post/35652469447/dear-peta-this-ad-is-really-upsetting">an open letter</a> to them, stating:</p>

<blockquote>This ad is really upsetting. You&#x2019;re implying that pubic hair that shows/grows &#x201C;outside the pantyline&#x201D; (which is normal/natural for the vast majority of us gals) is &#x201C;unattractive&#x201D;&#x2026;.this is the kind of shit Gillette and Nair would pull to hock product, and the sort of cultural beauty-standard malarkey that is contributing to a generally worrying trend&#x2026;12 and 13 year old girls demanding full bikini waxes and all the shit that I think we can all basically agree is absurd. Fur, bad. Yes. I&#x2019;m with you. But this ad is perpetuating really unhealthy attitudes. 

<p>Fear and unhappiness in the body-hair department is becoming more and more prevalent in young girls (and all women), because they feel they have no alternative. Most feel like they&#x2019;ll be judged if they don&#x2019;t tow the party line, and an organization like PETA has more cred (you&#x2019;re somewhat cool, right? you&#x2019;re forward-thinking people fighting for a noble cause, right?) than a corporate hair-removal/razor company. Despite the strides of progress made by the generation of women who came before us, we&#x2019;re slipping backwards. the beauty standard is becoming a more and more difficult struggle for young women. ads like this are part of the problem. PETA, if you care about animals, and their health and overall happiness index, take your human animals into account alongside the rest of them. Compassion for all.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In their own blog post introducing the ad campaign, which features <em>Real Housewives of Miami</em> cast member Joanna Krup, PETA wrote, &quot;she leaves little to be desired by sporting an unexpected accessory that doesn&apos;t really fit in with her fashion-forward style. Joanna thinks that wearing fur looks just as foolish as her little extra &apos;something something&apos; in this ad.&quot;</p>
