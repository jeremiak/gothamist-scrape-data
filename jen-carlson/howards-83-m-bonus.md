title: Howard's $83M Bonus

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094812/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/01/09/howard_back_on.php">A year after moving his show to the station</a>, Howard Stern received <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094812/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070109/media_nm/sirius_stern_dc">a bonus worth nearly $83 million</a> (22.1 million shares) from Sirius Satellite Radio today (&quot;for surpassing subscriber goals set in a 2004 contract that had already turned heads with its $500 million compensation package&quot;).</p>

<p>Not a bad deal at all. Sirius, along with its competitor in the satellite radio market, XM Radio, are growing rapidly. Each are losing money, however, by trying to get &quot;top-shelf entertainment&quot; like Stern, Oprah Winfrey and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094812/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/12/17/martha_stewarts.php">Martha Stewart</a>. But hopefully Sirius is hooking up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094812/http://productshopnyc.com/">the bloggers</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094812/http://brooklynvegan.com/">with radio shows</a> on their station, too.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Stern on Letterman giving away Sirius radios: </p>
