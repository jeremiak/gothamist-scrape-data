<p>Someone made a vertigo and nausea-inducing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324113314/http://www.pixelcase.com.au/vr/2009/newyork/">virtual tour of New York</a> (where it might even be possible to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324113314/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/06/air_force_one_nyc_flyover_photo_wil.php">recreate the 4/27/09 shot</a>). The aerial shots can start off from above Times Square, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, Downtown, Central Park or Governors Island. And before you know it, with some points and clicks, you are pretty much just like Superman, albeit listening to new age synth pop.</p>
