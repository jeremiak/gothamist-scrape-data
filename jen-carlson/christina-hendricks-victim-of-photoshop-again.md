<p>Will everyone please just leave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926011019/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinahendricks">Christina Hendricks</a>&apos;s body alone! First <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926011019/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/19/post_131.php">the NY Times</a> distorted her figure to prove some point that &quot;big girls&quot; shouldn&apos;t wear &quot;big dresses&quot;&#x2014;and now London Fog has Photoshop-chopped her curves off. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926011019/http://jezebel.com/5621871/christina-hendricks-curves-fall-victim-to-london-fogs-photoshop">Jezebel</a> did some comparing and contrasting of her photo shoot outtakes and the raincoat company&apos;s actual ad campaign, and lo and behold, the <em>Mad Men</em> starlet (who is known, and loved, for her curves) has been given the hatchet job again. <em>Sigh.</em> For the real deal, here&apos;s some untouched <em>video</em> from her shoot:</p>

<p>And London Fog, next time just hire Betty Draper or Pete Campbell if you&apos;re going to pull this stuff.</p>
