title: Studio 54 to Live Again on the Small Screen
---

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602110828/http://www.observer.com/2008/arts-culture/its-showtime-studio-54-series">The Observer</a> points out a new program coming to Showtime -- turns out the network has a New York-based series in the works called <em>Studio</em>. &quot;The show is less about the history of Studio 54 than it is about New York in the late &apos;70s, what people were going through, the political and social issues. Studio 54 is the backdrop for exploring that.&quot; While a Steve Rubell character is planned for the cast, &quot;the rest of the characters fictional or composites,&quot; and the plot won&apos;t be based on actual events...so don&apos;t expect to see Bianca Jagger ride in on a horse.</p>

<p><em>Hairspray</em> producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron are attached to work on the project and told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602110828/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3if7b717939831cbe299b1dc07abf0f060">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, &quot;It really was a time that has never been seen again. Socially, politically, everything about it was unique. It was the last hurrah before the era of AIDS.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are some of the more iconic images from the hay day of Studio 54 that you won&apos;t be seeing on Showtime. And check out some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602110828/http://www.sohoweeklynews.com//Book/Nightlife/index.htm">more photos here</a>.</p> <div class="galleryEase" id="gallery-0">
