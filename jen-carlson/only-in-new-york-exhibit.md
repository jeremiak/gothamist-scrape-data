</div></div>					<p>Print isn&apos;t dead just yet, it&apos;s living on as <em>art</em>. The Museum of the City of New York has put together a nostalgic exhibit comprised of photographs from the now defunct LOOK Magazine. The publication reached peak circulation (of nearly 8 million) in the late 1960s, with nationwide readers who were attracted to the Only in New York-esque photographs (some of them taken by the likes of Stanley Kubrick). So naturally, the exhibit is called &quot;Only in New York: Photographs from LOOK Magazine&quot; (as is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826011210/http://www.amazon.com/Only-New-York-Photographs-Magazine/dp/1580932487/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258125108&amp;sr=8-1">the book</a>).</p>

<p>It opens tomorrow with a reception (open to the public) beginning at 6:30 p.m. More details can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826011210/http://www.mcny.org/exhibitions/future/Only%20in%20New%20York.html">here</a>.</p>
