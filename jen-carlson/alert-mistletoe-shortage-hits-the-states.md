<p>Last year we were alarmed when we heard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030218/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/mistletoe_becoming_exctinct.php">mistletoe may become extinct</a>, but we moved on, and honestly... sort of forgot all about it. At that point the seasonal snog plant shortage was happening far away in the UK anyway. But now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030218/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/garden/a-mistletoe-shortage-threatens-a-holiday-kissing-tradition.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> is back with more fearmongering over losing the rape-kiss plant, reporting that the shortage has now hit the States, due to a relentless drought in Texas. They note the branches that have arrived in New York &quot;are so anemic that they just aren&#x2019;t worth the high price tag&quot; (which is typically $5 for a tiny branch).</p>

<p>One shop owner in Boerum Hill says that it&apos;s even hard to find the fake stuff these days, but fear not! <em>This doesn&apos;t mean a shortage of kissing.</em> Not on our watch. </p>

<p>A florist named Mr. George told the Grey Lady, &#x201C;In 1901 you needed to be under the mistletoe to steal a kiss in public. In 2011, you can do just about anything you want in public and it goes unnoticed. I don&#x2019;t think it will affect the number of kisses.&quot; But just in case, maybe we should think of a new plant that we can make out under?</p>
