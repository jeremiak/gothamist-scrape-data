<p>Yesterday a waiter at Applebee&apos;s in New York posted this photo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170206123714/http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/18yw8n/as_a_server_i_got_this_as_a_tip_from_a_little_kid/">to Reddit</a>, saying that he received <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170206123714/http://gothamist.com/tags/chuckecheese">Chuck E. Cheese</a> tokens and tickets from a tiny patron. The toddler was with his parents, who gave traditional money, and he handed his treasured items over at the end of the meal. The waiter writes, &quot;He smiled and gave em to me, and I couldn&apos;t help but smile back... those meant a lot to him, and he gave them to me.&quot; Of course, two tickets won&apos;t even get you an eraser at the prize station, but it&apos;s the thought that counts.</p>

<p>If this was too &quot;feel good&quot; for you, then keep reading. While &quot;researching&quot; this story, we stumbled into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170206123714/http://www.zoklet.net/bbs/showthread.php?t=170191">this depressing underworld</a> of Chuck E. Cheese ticket counterfeiters&#x2014;one calls it &quot;the perfect con, especially if you get a kid in on it with you to avoid suspicion.&quot; So this kid was probably just trying to unload some bad replicas.</p>
