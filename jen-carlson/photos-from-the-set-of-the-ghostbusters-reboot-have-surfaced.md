---

	
										<p>The female-fronted <em>Ghostbusters</em> reboot, under the direction of Paul Feig, has started filming... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151029125215/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/18/female_ghostbusters_reboot_will_tak.php">in Boston</a>. This week some photos leaked, via both those in on the production and those with long enough lenses to capture some shots of scenes filming. </p>

<p>Fieg was first, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151029125215/https://twitter.com/paulfeig/status/618605859241918465/photo/1">tweeting out this photo</a> of the Ecto-1 car, which is not quite like the iconic 1959 Cadillac ambulance we&apos;ve seen in past films. It is a Cadillac, however&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151029125215/http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/entertainment/news/a26018/new-ghostbusters-ecto-1/">Road &amp; Track</a> points out this is a 1989 Cadillac Brougham.</p>

<p>Next up we&apos;ve got the cast caught off-guard by paparazzi during filming&#x2014;Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are shown donning some dope jumpsuits:</p>
