</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151908/http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/html/gallery/home.shtml">New York City Municipal Archives</a> has gone digital, expanding their online archives&#x2014;starting today you can access 870,000 (and counting) of their old photographs, which date back to the mid-1800s. The online feature (which took them four years to get together) also provides free and open research access to their holdings, which not <em>only</em> include photographs, but maps, motion-pictures and audio recordings, as well. This is the first time their offerings are available online, and one and all are welcome to rummage through them.</p>

<p>Their archives can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151908/http://mtprawvwdorlna1.nyc.gov/">found here</a> (naturally, at press time the site isn&apos;t working, but keep trying). Click through for a preview of the nearly one million images (of their 2.2 million) showing New York City throughout the years as seen by municipal workers, the NYPD, the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, and people like Eugene de Salignac, the photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges/Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934 (many of his iconic photos from this time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151908/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/13/new_york_rises.php">have been seen</a> before).</p>
