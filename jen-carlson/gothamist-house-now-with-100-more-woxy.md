We&apos;ve got a big announcement to share, along with some little details of interest if you plan to attend any of the shows: </p>

<p>Our favorite radio station has come on board! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026162756/http://woxy.lala.com/">WOXY</a> will be broadcasting live from Gothamist House all week. The show will be streaming on their website, and later the &quot;best of&quot; will be compiled into a neat little podcast you can carry around with you on your portable music listening device of choice! </p>

<p>The House is free (no badges required), will be open from 2pm to around 8:30pm each day from October 17th through October 20th and will be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111026162756/http://www.whiterabbitnyc.com/">The White Rabbit</a> (145 E. Houston Street) again. Have to work? Listen on WOXY til you can come out and see the bands live! We&apos;ll be announcing the lineups in early October, so stay tuned for that. And again, if you&apos;re interested in becoming a sponsor for the show, please email GothamistHouse (a) gmail dot com. </p>
