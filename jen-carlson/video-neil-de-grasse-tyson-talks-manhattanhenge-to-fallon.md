The two talked about superheroes, Star Talk Radio, and the sun. Of Manhattanhenge Tyson says:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I realized there&apos;s something within us all that resonates with what the sun does, particularly when it&apos;s juxtaposed with stuff you created. And so, it turns out, that the street grid of Manhattan, twice a year, perfectly aligns with the setting sun of New Jersey.&quot;</blockquote>

<p><em>The Physics of Superheroes</em> <br>
deGrasse Tyson&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530225540/http://startalkradio.net/">Star Talk Radio</a> sounds worth tuning in to, with topics like time travel, how could Superman could fly, and guests like Jon Stewart talking about their favorite element (Stewart, who majored in chemistry, chose Carbon, &quot;because it&apos;s the slut of the periodic table, it binds with all different elements in many different ways: from behind, from above...&quot;).</p>
