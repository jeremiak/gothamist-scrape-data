<p>In the below video, which had to have been influenced by the 1956 film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517174954/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048980/"><em>The Red Balloon</em></a>, you&apos;ll get a look at the then brand-new Terminal 3 at JFK, also known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517174954/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldport_%28Pan_Am%29">Worldport</a>. Released sometime in 1959 or 1960, director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517174954/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7315af25">Harvey Yale Gross</a> got a little weird on Pan Am&apos;s behalf. Check it out: </p>

<p>The uploader notes: &quot;Made with an avant garde fashion that combines black and white footage with color material, and with almost no spoken dialogue or sound effects, the movie shows how the airline&apos;s new, high tech terminal makes everything about air travel easy&#x2014;and glamorous.&quot; Like we need to be reminded how much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517174954/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/8_reasons_air_travel_used_to_be_coo.php">cooler air travel was</a> back before the days we all spent our times in airports tweeting @ airlines about delays.<br>
