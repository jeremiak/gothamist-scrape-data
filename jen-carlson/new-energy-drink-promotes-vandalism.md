<p>Remember AriZona Iced Tea? Well, its made a cross-country image trip and landed in the heart of NYC with its new energy drink called All City NRG (you know, like the subway lines). As you can see, the cans are all tagged up, and their promo van is similarly decorated -- though it&apos;s sort of camouflaged when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126172739/http://razorapple.com/2008/01/24/arizona-all-city-nrg/">parked in the streets of Bushwick</a>, no?</p>

<p>Wes Vultaggio, Creative Director for AriZona, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126172739/http://thehobbyshophero.blogspot.com/2008/01/httpfactone.html">says</a> &quot;We call the cans our &apos;subway series&apos;. The art is a form of expression that captures the creativity, imagination, and energy of the urban lifestyle. Since AriZona originated in Brooklyn, we thought we would pay tribute to the passion and originality of these artists with our own street art design on the can and with a bold energy-infused beverage.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126172739/http://www.nysun.com/article/70915">City Council Member Peter Vallone</a> is, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126172739/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/06/when_you_tag_in_a_graffiti_haters_hood.php">not surprisingly</a>, saying that this product clearly promotes vandalism! He says, &quot;This product shamelessly glorifies a culture of vandalism and lawlessness. If this drink was called &apos;pickpocket pickup,&apos; and had pictures of criminals lifting wallets, wouldn&apos;t people be offended?&quot; Mmm...pickpocket pickup. But it&apos;s not like the drink is being sold with a can of spray paint - yet!</p>

<p>Other products to raise the ire of City Council members:  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126172739/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/03/nyc_pols_hate_c.php">Cocaine energy drink</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160126172739/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/15/jim_brown_says.php">thug chips</a>.<br>
