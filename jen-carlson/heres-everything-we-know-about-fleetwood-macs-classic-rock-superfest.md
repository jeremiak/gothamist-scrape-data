<span class="photo_caption">Yes, there&apos;s a trailer for the shows.</span></p>

<p>Earlier this year it was announced that Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080103/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/02/fleetwood_mac_eagles_fest.php">would be hosting a bi-coastal festival</a>: one weekend event in New York City, and one in Los Angeles. They&apos;ve just released more details on whats&apos; being called The Classic West and Classic East shows, and this is everything we know so far: </p>

<p><strong>Who&apos;s playing? </strong></p>

<p>Fleetwood Mac<br>
The Eagles<br>
Steely Dan<br>
Journey<br>
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire<br>
The Doobie Brothers</p>

<p><strong>When &amp; Where</strong></p>

<p>The Classic West will be at Dodger Stadium on July 15 and 16<br>
The Classic East will be at Citi Field on July 29 and 30</p>

<p><strong>Which one should I go to?</strong> </p>

<p>No matter where you are from, the Classic West will be better, because do you think Fleetwood Mac is playing Dodger Stadium without bringing out the goddamn USC marching band for &quot;Tusk&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>Is there a website?</strong> </p>

<p>Yes: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080103/http://theclassic.com/">theclassic.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Is this <em>really</em> a festival, like last year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080103/http://laist.com/tags/deserttrip">Desert Trip</a>?</strong></p>

<p>No. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080103/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/arts/music/classic-west-classic-east-fleetwood-mac-eagles.html?_r=0">the NY Times</a>, the &quot;organizers are not using the term festival, since the shows are taking place in urban stadiums with no room for Ferris wheels or chill-out tents.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Wow, no chill-out tents?</strong></p>

<p>&#x1F61E;</p>

<p><strong>Where do I get tickets?</strong></p>

<p>Tickets go on sale Friday, April 7 at 10 a.m. via Ticketmaster. If you have an American Express card, you can get tickets even earlier, however, on April 3 at 10 a.m. But wait, there&apos;s more: Special VIP packages will also be available, including premium tickets, pre-show VIP lounge, exclusive merchandise, parking and more.     </p>

<p><em>How much?</em></p>

<p>Anywhere from $150 to $2,750 &#x2014; depending on what kind of ticket/package you buy. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080103/http://www.theclassiceast.com/tickets/">check them out here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Will this be the first time in history that these six esteemed artists have ever played together on the same stage in two of America&#x2019;s greatest rock &amp; roll cities?</strong> </p>

<p>Hell yeah it is.</p>

<p><strong>I didn&apos;t get the above reference to a marching band..?</strong></p>

<p>JFC. </p>

<p><strong>Interesting. I&apos;d like to know more about Lindsey Buckingham &#x2014; have you ever interviewed him? </strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can read our interview with Buckingham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080103/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/lindsey_buckingham.php">at this link</a>.</p>
