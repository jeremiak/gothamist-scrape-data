<p>Earlier, the trusted (and not scaremongery) weather source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330032245/https://twitter.com/Occuweather">OccuWeather</a> Tweeted that Thundersnow would likely be happening this afternoon and/or evening:</p>

<p>You remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330032245/http://gothamist.com/tags/thundersnow">Thundersnow</a>, right? It demands capitalization and occurs in intense snow bands, bringing a mix of lightning strikes and thunder to the wintery weather game. This is the kind of truly awesome combo that SyFy movies are made of: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>you&apos;d need James Balog to figure out a way to film this, but yes RT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330032245/https://twitter.com/Matt_D_Cohen">@Matt_D_Cohen</a> POLAR VORTEX VS.

<p>Here&apos;s a classic 1996 broadcast, where startled weatherman Jim Cantore reacts: &quot;Whoa! We just had a thunder... snow&quot;:</p>
