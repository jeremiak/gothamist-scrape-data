<p>Christine McVie has rejoined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216203647/http://gothamist.com/tags/fleetwoodmac">Fleetwood Mac</a> after departing 16 years ago&#x2014;and this is no <em>rumour</em>, the word came straight from drummer Mick Fleetwood&apos;s mouth on stage at Uncle Willie K&apos;s BBQ Blues Fest in Maui <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216203647/http://pitchfork.com/news/53561-christine-mcvie-rejoining-fleetwood-mac/">over the weekend</a>. He told the audience: &quot;This is the worst kept secret there is, but Christine McVie will be rejoining Fleetwood Mac.&quot; This comes two years after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216203647/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/lindsey_buckingham.php">Lindsey Buckingham told us</a>, &quot;Christine McVie is out of the band and she burned all of her bridges in Los Angeles.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216203647/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/christine-mcvie-back-in-fleetwood-mac-20140113#ixzz2qJJvCVpI">Rolling Stone</a>, she began rehearsing with the band at the end of last year &quot;for two shows on the group&apos;s European tour. At the time, however, frontwoman Stevie Nicks shrugged off the possibility of a full-scale reunion.&quot; In fact, Nicks said &quot;there&apos;s no more a chance of that happening than an asteroid hitting the earth. She is done.&quot; (And Nicks isn&apos;t the only one who didn&apos;t believe: My dad, who was unreachable for comment on this news at press time, was all: &quot;never gonna happen!&quot;)</p>

<p>However, McVie did return to stage with her former bandmates at their London show last September, after which she told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216203647/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/22/christine-mcvie-wants-to-rejoin-fleetwood-mac">The Guardian</a>, &quot;If they were to ask me [back] I would probably be very delighted... but it hasn&apos;t happened so we&apos;ll have to wait and see.&quot; At the time, she felt good about her brief moment back on stage, but said rejoining officially was &quot;a long way down that path if it ever were to happen. John&apos;s got to get well first, so it hasn&apos;t been talked about. We&apos;ll have to wait and see.&quot; Her ex, bassist John McVie, was diagnosed with cancer last October&#x2014;but Nicks says &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216203647/http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/stevie-nicks-talks-filming-american-horror-story-coven-katy-perry-and-john-mayer-dating-don-henley-and-more-201481">he&apos;s gonna be fine</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, the band isn&apos;t currently touring or in the studio, that we know of, so it&apos;s unclear what this reunion really means at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The band&apos;s publicist, Liz Rosenberg, has made it official&#x2014;she confirmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216203647/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5869665/christine-mcvie-rejoins-fleetwood-mac-official?mobile_redirection=false">to Billboard</a> that McVie &quot;has indeed re-joined Fleetwood Mac and we are hoping to make an announcement about a possible tour for the full tilt Macsters some time in 2014.&quot;</p>
