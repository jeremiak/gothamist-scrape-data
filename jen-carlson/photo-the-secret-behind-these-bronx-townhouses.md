<p>Years ago the Brooklyn Heights townhouse at 58 Joralemon Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132350/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/13/secret_subways_entrances.php">was unmasked</a> for what it really is: a piece of MTA property used to hide a subway ventilator, and an emergency exit for the tunnel below it. (It&apos;s armed with silent alarms, motion detectors and other hidden security, so don&apos;t even try it! Whatever it is. Living there?). Unsurprisingly, this isn&apos;t the only townhouse in town masking something&#x2014;recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132350/http://www.scoutingny.com/whats-wrong-with-these-bronx-townhouses/">Nick at Scouting NY</a> noticed something off with a row of townhouses on Bruckner Blvd in the Bronx, which look like a New York City version of McMansions, gated and all.

<p>Behind the doors aren&apos;t families cooking dinner, and there&apos;s no secret subway exit either... it&apos;s Con Ed&#x2019;s Mott Haven Electric Substation, which was built around six years ago. At the time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132350/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/nyregion/05substation.html?_r=2&amp;">the NY Times</a> reported that &quot;the building&#x2019;s urban camouflage is typical of the lengths that Con Edison must go to these days to appease neighbors when constructing substations.&quot; Learn more about the row of townhouses, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132350/http://mn.gov/commerce/energyfacilities/documents/19981/MGC%20Attachment%202.pdf">were awarded</a> for their design, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407132350/http://www.scoutingny.com/whats-wrong-with-these-bronx-townhouses/">over at Scouting</a>.</p>
