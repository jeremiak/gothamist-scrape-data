According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130921042420/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/exclusive_card_losers_rack_with_kuV85HYOZGOfD3ln6hHN4J">the NY Post</a>, two &quot;wanna-be players&quot; rang up a $28,500 tab at the nightclub before the waitstaff wondered how they were going to pay for it. <p></p>

<p>Robsson Depeine and Jeff Sylvain were trying to impress the celebrity crowd Monday night&#x2014;which included Lil Kim and Snoop Dogg, there for rapper Juelz Santana&apos;s birthday&#x2014;ordering bottles of expensive bubbly&#x2014;even sending one over to the birthday boy. After ordering 40 bottles of Moet Nectar Rose, and a 9 liter bottle of Veuve Clicquot, the duo asked for a $5,500 twelve liter bottle. Manager Dan Devlin told the paper, &quot;That&#x2019;s when one of our managers became suspicious. The purchase was ridiculous and Sylvain introduced a second card with his ID and I knew that&#x2019;s when there was a problem.&quot; Originally an AMEX gift card that Sylvain had doctored was holding the tab open.</p>

<p>When staff started grabbing the remaining champagne bottles from their table, the men tried to flee the scene, but were nabbed by security. Currently they&apos;re being held on $20,000 bail (or 4 bottles of Veuve!). Their lawyer says they&apos;re being set up, however, and that &quot;the club couldn&apos;t find the real person who gave them the credit card, so my clients were wrongfully identified. It&apos;s a joke.&quot; Earlier that night a man was busted for a similar crime, but Devlin warns, &quot;People better think twice about coming here (with a stolen credit card) because you are going to go to jail.&quot;</p>
