Photographer Scott Lynch scoped the scene out for us earlier this week and returned with a memory card full of the best looking&#x2014;and mostly bespectacled&#x2014;bookworms we&apos;ve ever seen. He reports back:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Taking over all three floors of the beautiful old brick school building as well as most of the museum&apos;s courtyard&#x2014;including a number of exhibitors in the VW Dome&#x2014;the NY Art Book Fair features nearly 300 artists, zine-sters, graphic designers, gallerists, and independent publishers and booksellers from all over the world hawking their printed-matter wares. Everything&apos;s for sale, and prices range from $1 to a$tronomical, but most people&apos;s primary agenda seemed to be browsing, chatting, drinking, and looking good.              

<p>Because, yes, this was definitely a good looking crowd: gay, straight, mostly young, very international, and, despite the presence of some of the heaviest of hitters in the NYC gallery scene (hi Gagosian!), by and large a much scruffier bunch than what you&apos;d find at a typical art fair.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Cancel your OK Cupid account, power down all things digital, and surround yourself with print and real life people this weekend&#x2014;at the very least you&apos;ll walk away with a &apos;Zine and a belly full of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152027/http://www.yelp.com/menu/m-wells-dinette-long-island-city/item/blood-pudding">blood pudding</a>&#x2014;booze and food are sold on the grounds by the excellent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152027/http://magasinwells.com/">M. Wells</a> crew.</p>

<p><em>The NY Art Book Fair runs through Sunday at MoMA PS1 (22-25 Jackson Ave, Long Island City). Admission is free.</em> </p>
