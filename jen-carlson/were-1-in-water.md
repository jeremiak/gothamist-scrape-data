Well, we&apos;ve been vindicated, because at the NY State Fair in Syracuse--we placed 1st! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430110154/http://www.health.state.ny.us/press/releases/2008/2008-08-26_water_contest_winner.htm">The New York State Department of Health</a> has announced that <strong>NYC &quot;won the coveted title for best-tasting drinking water in New York over 150 other municipal water systems during the final competition.&quot;</strong> However, they note it&apos;s a &quot;nonscientific competition,&quot; and the Health Commissioner downplayed the achievement by declaring:&quot;Considering that NYC&apos;s water comes from reservoirs in Delaware, Greene, Ulster, Putnam, Westchester, Schoharie, Sullivan and Dutchess counties, these counties are also winners.&quot; Whatever, the blue ribbon is all ours...along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430110154/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/16/nyc_tap_water_g.php">the A grade</a> Riverkeeper gave us for tap water back in May.</p>
