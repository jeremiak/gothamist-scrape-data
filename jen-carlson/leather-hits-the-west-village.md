<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001143/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/04/sm_fest.php">Last week</a> a group of parents in the West Village were up in arms about the S&amp;M; street festival hitting a street too close to home. Yesterday the fest, which was part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001143/http://www.newyorkleatherweekend.com/home.html">New York Leather Weekend</a>, hit Weehawken Street -- or shall we say whipped? Those in attendance perused a plethora of whips, chains, blindfolds and other S&amp;M; garb.</p>

<p>Those not in attendance were undoubtedly plotting a way to make sure their children are never exposed to anything more than a G-rated street fair again (many suggest moving to New Jersey). The organizer of the event told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001143/http://www.amny.com/news/local/am-feti1008,0,7927333.story">amNewYork</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;We are still here, we still belong here,&quot; said Richard Ives, a festivalgoer. &quot;Other communities have the church group or the country club. This is like that for people who don&apos;t feel comfortable in those kinds of settings. The dynamic in the city has changed so much,&quot; he said &quot;We are trying honor the history and the heritage of the leather movement. We are not going to hurt anybody. Unless they want to be hurt, of course.&quot;</blockquote>Those in the &apos;hood that resist this type of celebration of diversity have been calling for the removal of appointed Community Board 2 Chairperson Brad Hoylman and CB2 District Manager Bob Gormley. We received an email from Brad Hoylman with a copy of what he had been sending to those protesting, and we&apos;d have to agree that this type of street fair is preferable to those &quot;generic, cookie-cutter&quot; ones.<p></p>
