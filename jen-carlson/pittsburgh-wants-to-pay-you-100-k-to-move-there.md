<p>FADE IN: A 50-yr-old beatnick heads west from New York City, hobo stick slung over shoulder, humming Tom Petty&apos;s &quot;Last Dance With Mary Jane&quot; while the lyrics run through his head. &quot;Well, I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;ve been told, You never slow down, you never grow old. I&apos;m tired of screwin&apos; up, tired of going down, Tired of myself, tired of this town.&quot; <em>It&apos;s looking bleak.</em> Enter: Pittsburgh!</p>

<p>Are <em>you</em> an older creative struggling to make rent in New York City? Are <em>you</em> tired of those kids in Williamsburg you read about and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005031/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/11/james_franco_brings_james_franco_to.php">James Franco</a> getting all the attention from the art world? Are <em>you</em> ready to retire to a river city? Pittsburgh might be willing to embrace you with open arms and a cool $100,000 cash.</p>

<p>The city is seeking folks over 45 (they call this demographic &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005031/http://www.experienceddreamers.org/About.php">Experienced Dreamers</a>&quot;) who still want to &quot;realize [their] dream.&quot; With that in mind, they&apos;re offering $100K to the right person, and all you have to do is... move to Pittsburgh. Actually, Pittsburgh is pretty great, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005031/http://www.brokelyn.com/would-you-move-to-pittsburgh-for-100k/">Brokelyn</a> points out, the unemployment rate is consistently below the national average and the beer is really cheap. Leaving the only real catch to be: half of the money you receive if you win <em>has</em> to go to charity. So, would you move to Pittsburgh for... $50,000?</p>
