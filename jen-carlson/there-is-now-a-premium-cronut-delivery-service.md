<p>Have you cashed in on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135154/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronuts">The Cronut Craze</a> yet? While some have been taking to the streets and selling the coveted sweets on the sidewalk and Craigslist, someone has launched a very official looking Cronut Delivery Service. Sorry: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135154/http://www.croissantdoughnut.com/"><em>Premium</em> Cronut Delivery Service</a>. The site is already taking orders (though they shut down the form once they hit their max for the day), and they explain their vi$ion below:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Croissant-doughnuts... are delicious, and we make it easy for you to enjoy them. Our white glove service enables you to enjoy New York&apos;s hottest confection without waiting in line at 5 a.m. in front of the Dominique Ansel bakery.  We&apos;ll wait in line, get your order (1, 2 or 3 cronuts at this time), and deliver it to you&#x2014;same day, with a smile.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>They will only be accepting 20 deliveries per week day, most likely due to the bakery&apos;s maximum order rule (orders open at 12 a.m., Monday through Friday).  But how long until Dominique Ansel shuts down this operation? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135154/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/06/shameless_entrepreneur_sets_up_cronut_delivery_service.php">Eater</a> points out that the domain is owned by someone named Deborah Umunnabuike, who they say is the co-founder of EatHarlem.com... and she may be hearing from the Ansel soon, as he has been personally weeding out scalpers from the line.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Found 2 scalpers and threw them out. People - these guys smell like alcohol and haven&apos;t showered for days...you bought food they touched?!!</p>&#x2014; Dominique Ansel (@DominiqueAnsel) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135154/https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/statuses/342289362735751169">June 5, 2013</a></blockquote>
