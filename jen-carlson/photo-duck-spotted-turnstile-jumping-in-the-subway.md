<p>When we first saw this image of a duck entering the New York City subway system, we naively believed that he stepped right out of a children&apos;s book and was playing out his magical and triumphant story about a little duck in a big city. And what joy this duck was surely bringing to fellow straphangers as he waddled along to catch the N train to their yelps of &quot;Only in New York!&quot;</p>

<p>But moments later we discovered that our new feathered friend did not make a personal choice to ride the rails today, instead he was forced to by the corporate overlords of one of the nation&apos;s largest insurance companies. Yep, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003815/http://instagram.com/aflacduck">the Aflac duck</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to PETA to see how they feel about a duck being brought into the subway system for a social media marketing campaign, and will update when we hear back. In the meantime, Adam Lisberg at the MTA tells us:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Ducks don&#x2019;t belong on the subway, especially waddling through stations, and especially not when they&#x2019;re used as part of a publicity stunt that makes it harder for our customers to get around. We did not know about this stunt, we did not approve it, and we&#x2019;ve made clear to Aflac that it was improper. New Yorkers know that animals are only allowed in the subway when they&#x2019;re enclosed in containers that will prevent them from annoying any other passengers.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Now what do you have to say for yourselves, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003815/http://instagram.com/p/enCe-Whber/">Lance Bass and Joey Fatone</a>?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> PETA tells us they are contacting Aflac &quot;with concerns about taking a live duck into a busy New York City subway station. A subway station is no place for a duck, who can&apos;t possibly understand the reason for all the noise and commotion of an everyday commute, let alone a gathering crowd with flashing cameras. Aflac has been so creative in the past with its use of computer-generated imagery, puppets, and others alternatives to live animals in its ads, and we&apos;re hopeful that in the future Aflac will leave live ducks out of its publicity stunts and use its creative power to come up with a kinder way to grab the public&apos;s attention.&quot;</p>
