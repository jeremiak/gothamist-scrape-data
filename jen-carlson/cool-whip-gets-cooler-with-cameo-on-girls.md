<p>Last night&apos;s episode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130124072240/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">of <em>Girls</em></a> featured a culinary cameo by the nation&apos;s most controversial dessert topping: Cool Whip. So instead of doing a traditional recap of the episode, we thought we&apos;d seize this rare opportunity to discuss The Whip, which during our viewing stirred up many heightened opinions amongst friends. Is it disgusting? Do you freeze it? Is it giving you cancer? Are its aerosal counterparts superior for delivering the whippet? (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130124072240/http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/38166686069/TZqjS2CY">Betty Draper thinks so</a>.)</p>

<p>Cool Whip is mostly water and air... but it also contains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130124072240/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.05/st_coolwhip.html">all this other stuff</a>, which Wired refers to as a &quot; blend of sugar, wax, and condom lube.&quot; But let&apos;s say you&apos;re okay with ingesting a little bit of High-Fructose Corn Syrup and some things you can&apos;t pronounce... what&apos;s the best way?</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="whipthe0113.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130124072240im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/whipthe0113.jpeg" width="350" height="299" class="image-right"> </span><strong>WITH A SPOON</strong>: Classic choice. Just like Lena Dunham&apos;s character Hannah did last night on <em>Girls</em>, the best way to indulge in the whipped product is straight out of the fridge, with a spoon, and while standing in your kitchen. Clothes are optional, though surprisingly Dunham went with a fully-clad look for this scene.</p>

<p><strong>FROZEN</strong>: Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130124072240/http://www.myfitnesspal.com/topics/show/35801-frozen-cool-whip-pretend-it-s-ice-cream">a depressing thread</a> about how frozen Cool Whip is just like ice cream. It&apos;s not... but it&apos;ll do in a pinch, and packs a lot less calories.</p>

<p><strong>CHOCOLATE LASAGNA</strong>: If you&apos;re going to &quot;cook,&quot; check this thing out&#x2014;it basically consists of instant pudding, Oreos, butter, and cream cheese, all neatly layered to create a Cool Whipped homage to Garfield&apos;s favorite food. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130124072240/http://picky-palate.com/2012/03/30/working-with-cool-whip/">Get the recipe here</a>, and as always, there&apos;s no baking involved.</p>

<p>No matter what way you deliver it into your system, remember: there&apos;s no shame in indulging in The Whip... even judgmental Marnie didn&apos;t blink as Hannah spooned dollops of it into her mouth.</p>
