<p>So many 1980s subway videos are popping up lately&#x2014;this morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071713/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/20/video_raquel_welch_dances_in_the_ny.php">we saw a fantastical one</a> starring dance routines with Raquel Welch, and now we&apos;ve got some <em>real</em> footage, starring Michael Musto. The uploader writes: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071713/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Sullivan">Nelson</a>, photographer Liz Lizard and her family, Michael Musto and Albert Crudo take the subway from Union Square to Coney Island on June 20, 1987.&quot; It provides some great shots of what the subway looked like that year, graffiti and all.</p>
