Below, some of our favorites:\r\n\<ul\>\<li\>Museum of the Moving image is one of our favorite museums in NYC, and the membership promises to be one of the most fun ones a museum offers. They\'ve got a ton of programming on and off the screen, as well as a solid permanent collection. Membership \<a href=\"http://www.movingimage.us/support/membership-2016\"\>starts at $75\<\/a\>.\r\n\<li\>You can gift someone a membership at BAM \<a href=\"http://www.bam.org/join\"\>starting at $85\<\/a\>, which will get them savings on movie tickets, advance access to special screenings, invites to Member Mingles, and more.\r\n\<li\>The NY Botanical Garden and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden both offer memberships, starting at \<a href=\"http://www.nybg.org/support_the_garden/membership/join.php\"\>$85\<\/a\> and \<a href=\"http://www.bbg.org/support/join\"\>$50\<\/a\> respectively. We love them both, so pick the one closest to your recipient.\r\n\<li\>Housing Works offers \<a href=\"https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=62930#\"\>a number of memberships\<\/a\>, which will get you a percentage off on purchases, a tote bag, invites, and more.\r\n\<li\>AMNH offers \<em\>a lot\<\/em\> of different membership options, depending on what you\'re interested in and how much you want to spend. You can \<a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/join-support/become-a-member/\"\>learn more about them here\<\/a\>.\r\n\<li\>The \<a href=\"https://newmuseum.thankyou4caring.org/pages/general-membership-form-holiday-2015-promo?tab=1\"\>New Museum membership\<\/a\> is a wonderful way to skip the line on some of the most popular exhibits in town, receive free regular admission, and get access to invite-only events. ($80+)\r\n\<li\>Metrograph and Alamo Drafthouse, the two greatest movie theaters to open in NYC this year, both have gift card offerings. \<a href=\"http://metrograph.com/giftcards\"\>Metrograph\'s\<\/a\> start at $50 and can be used for movie tickets, food, beverages and cocktails, books from the book shop, and concessions from our candy shop. You\'ll have to go there to pick one up, though. At Alamo, they start at $30 and could be bought as \<a href=\"https://drafthouse.cashstar.com/gift-card/buy/\"\>an eGiftCard\<\/a\>, or the \<a href=\"https://drafthouse.cashstar.com/gift-card/plastic/\"\>old school cards\<\/a\>. They offer online purchases, but if you go to the theater they\'ll have them there, too.\r\n\<li\>This is also a great time to support your local bookstore. Most of them will have gift cards if you don\'t know which book your recipient wants. You can probably even buy them online, like at \<a href=\"http://www.strandbooks.com/gift-card\"\>the Strand\<\/a\>.\<\/ul\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_5'] = photo;</script>
