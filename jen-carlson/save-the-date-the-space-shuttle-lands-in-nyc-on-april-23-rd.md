<p>The Space Shuttle Enterprise is finally coming to its new permanent home, New York City. The Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, who last November became the official title holders of the shuttle, has just announced that it will arrive on April 23rd. The shuttle actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302073441/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/meet_nycs_space_shuttle_the_enterpr.php#photo-1">never orbited space</a> (but it was visited by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302073441/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/12/shuttle_enterpise_is_coming_to_the.php">the cast of <em>Star Trek</em></a>), so this will be one of its most historic journeys. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s what we know, <strong>the Enterprise will arrive in New York on the back of a NASA Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and touch down at John F. Kennedy International Airport</strong> to kick-off a welcome celebration. Then, <strong>in June, it will move by barge to the Intrepid, going past the Statue of Liberty on its route. </strong></p>

<p>Once it docks, the shuttle will be lifted by crane and placed on the flight deck of the Intrepid where it will be on exhibit to the public starting this summer in a temporary climate-controlled pavilion, until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120302073441/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/new_rendering_shows_space_shuttle_e.php">a permanent exhibit facility</a> is worked out. </p>

<p>In a joint statement, Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum&apos;s Co-Chairmen of the Board Charles de Gunzburg and Richard Santulli said, &#x201C;The arrival of Enterprise is a monumental occasion for all of us.  Not only can we marvel at her greatness firsthand, but she will enrich the City of New York, its inhabitants and millions of visitors from around the world.&quot; Senator Charles Schumer, who was fighting to win the city the shuttle, said, &#x201C;Once it lands next month, the Enterprise will immediately become an iconic and must-see destination in New York that will further contribute to our reputation as the greatest city in the world.&#x201D;</p>
