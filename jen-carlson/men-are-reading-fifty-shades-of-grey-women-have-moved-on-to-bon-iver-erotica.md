<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215941/http://soundbible.com/1375-Whip-Crack.html">BREAKING</a>!: Men are reading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215941/http://gothamist.com/tags/fiftyshadesofgrey"><em>Fifty Shades Of Grey</em></a> trilogy, which was previously believed to have only been read by women! This news comes straight from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215941/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_FIFTY_SHADES_OF_GREY_MEN?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">the AP</a>, where they report some of these men are doctors, some are churchgoers, some are gay and some are straight straight, and some just claim they thought it was more of an <em>American Psycho</em> type series (which is only slightly disturbing)... but they all kept reading. Even Mayor Michael Bloomberg has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215941/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/01/photos_video_mayor_bloomberg_sings.php#photo-1">picked the book up</a>. The excerpts from the article are nothing short of awkward:</p>

<blockquote>Jeremiah Wirth, a grad student and Iraqi war vet in Maine, said the opening book was nothing short of a life-changer. He read it on a business trip to &quot;magical&quot; Hawaii, returning home to Bangor a better man. &quot;I was away from my girlfriend. I was lonely and I was reading this book in this beautiful place and I thought it would be something fun and easy,&quot; said the 26-year-old Kurt Vonnegut and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, just a year younger than the fictional Grey. &quot;People hear about flogging and stuff like that in this book, and they don&apos;t get it.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Tell it to the men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215941/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/50_shades_of_grey.php">taking classes in flogging</a>, Jeremiah. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, women have moved on to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215941/http://boniverotica.tumblr.com/">Bon Iver Erotica</a>, which gets the job done, albeit, a lot slower.</p>
