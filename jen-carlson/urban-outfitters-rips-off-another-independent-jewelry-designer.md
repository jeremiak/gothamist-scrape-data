<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228183634/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/25/urban_outfitters.php">Last year</a> two jewelry designers at the Brooklyn Flea claimed Urban Outfitters was ripping off their style, and now it seems they&apos;re at it again. Etsy seller Stevie Koerner produces a line of pendants she calls &quot;A World of Love,&quot; and they look an awful lot like some new pendants for sale at Urban Outfitters. Once the discovery was made, Koerner wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228183634/http://imakeshinythings.tumblr.com/post/5855716317/not-cool-urban-outfitters-not-cool">on her Tumblr</a>: </p>

<blockquote>My heart sank a little bit.  The World/United States of Love line that I created is one of the reasons that I was able to quit my full-time job.  <strong>They even stole the item name as well as some of my copy.</strong> I&#x2019;m very disappointed in Urban Outfitters. I know they have stolen designs from plenty of other artists. I understand that they are a business, but it&#x2019;s not cool to completely rip off an independent designer&#x2019;s work.</blockquote> 

<p>As of right now, Urban Outfitters has updated their online shop to say the product is no longer available, so maybe the times they are a changin&apos;.</p>
