<p>Someone in the cheese department at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191259/http://www.wmarketnyc.com/">the Westside Market</a> has gotten creative with the cheese labeling. Or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191259/https://twitter.com/#!/kathycacace/status/163765707174195201">Kathy Cacace</a> notes in her Tweet: has &quot;fucking lost their mind.&quot; The description on this chunk of mimolette reads: &quot;Sara had been gone for 25 years, and in all that time I hadn&apos;t found any new ways to cope. Only to miss her.&quot; This appears to be from James Patterson&apos;s book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191259/http://books.google.com/books?id=VPE6Orsz1nIC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=i+hadn&apos;t+found+any+new+ways+to+cope&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5zkBbLG5jd&amp;sig=JZmql28teCIQifEJGYU5C9PRe3o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HhknT8uzC8rX0QG85-S4CA&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=i%20hadn&apos;t%20found%20any%20new%20ways%20to%20cope&amp;f=false"><em>Run For Your Life</em></a>, where he writes something similar about a woman named &quot;Maeve.&quot;</p>

<p>A call to the market led nowhere, so this story is turning into a regular mystery! Anyway, cheer up, Westside Market cheese guy.</p>

<p><b>Update, 1/31</b>: We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191259/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/meet_the_mysterious_cheesemonger_be.php">spoke to Peter Daniels</a>, the man behind the literary labels.  Well, they are also musical&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191259/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/31/meet_the_mysterious_cheesemonger_be.php#photo-3">one cheese has a Run DMC quote</a>!</p>
