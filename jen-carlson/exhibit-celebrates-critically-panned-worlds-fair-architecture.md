</div></div>					<p>Both the 1939-40 and 1964-65 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008161239/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldsfair">World&apos;s Fairs</a> will get the spotlight they deserve at an upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008161239/http://gtmuseum.org/">Godwin-Ternbach Museum</a> exhibit. The exhibit will focus specifically on the architecture at both of the Fairs, which the Queens College museum says often goes ignored. When it hasn&apos;t been ignored, it&apos;s often gotten panned&#x2014;at the 1960s Fair, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008161239/http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2014/04/140418-Architects-Remember-the-64-65-Worlds-Fair.asp?WT.mc_id=rss_archrecord">for example</a>, much of it was called &quot;garish architectural gimmickry,&quot; with &quot;bright colors, odd shapes, and novel materials.&quot; But who could ever hate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008161239/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-n-y-c-mystery-history-hour-after-the-new-york-worlds-fair">on those lampposts</a>?</p>

<p>Many believed it was an issue to not have a theme, but a lot of styles coming together from all over&#x2014;&quot;a cacophony of architectural styles and forms, mixing modernism and popular culture, rather than the unified style that many critics expected of a world&apos;s fair.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008161239/http://www.rockarch.org/publications/resrep/pdf/nicoletta.pdf">PDF</a>)</p>

<p>This exhibit will feature 100 rarely seen photos &quot;drawn from local, national and even international archives.&quot; It will be on view from June 29th through July 27th. In the meantime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008161239/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/13/1939_worlds_fair_photos.php">here&apos;s a look</a> at the 1939-40 World&apos;s Fair being built.</p>
