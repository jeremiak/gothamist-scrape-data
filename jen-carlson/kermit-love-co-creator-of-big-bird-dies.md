<p><img alt="0806kermitlove.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151407im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0806kermitlove.jpg" width="225" height="364" class="right">The creator of Big Bird and Snuffleupagus, Kermit Love, died at the age of 91 this past Saturday from congestive heart failure; he was in Poughkeepsie, close to where he lived with his long-time partner Christopher Lyall. Though many rumored Kermit the Frog was named after him, the character was created long before Love began his career. </p>

<p>While Love is best known for his work with Jim Henson, he also spun his costume design magic for television and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151407/http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=25024">stage</a> productions, as well as renowned choreographers, including Twyla Tharp and Agnes de Mille. Yet the furry and feathered creatures will be his legacy, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151407/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/arts/24love.html">The NY Times</a> takes a look inside everyone&apos;s favorite forever young bird, which he helped create:</p><blockquote>Mr. Henson, the creator of &#x201C;Sesame Street,&#x201D; who died in 1990, did the original sketches of Big Bird. Mr. Love built the bird, with its manhole-sized orange foam feet. He added feathers (with some designed to fall off) to make the creature cuter. Inside, Mr. Spinney controlled Big Bird&#x2019;s mouth with his hand and the eyes with a lever attached to his pinky finger. A television monitor inside the puppet allowed Mr. Spinney to see the set.</blockquote>The AP recently looked even further under the suit, at Caroll Spinney, and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151407/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCpQW-k9sdw">watch that video here</a>. After a year in the suit, Spinney nearly left New York saying he couldn&apos;t afford it anymore, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151407/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/16/arts/Advice-From-Big-Bird.php">Love urged him to stay</a> -- and the next week Big Bird was on the cover of Time magazine. <p></p>

<p>Love also made appearances on the show, he played Willy the Hot Dog Man, sporadically showing up on screen between the 1970s and 90s. Willy wore a yellow feather in his hat (pictured), a tribute from Love to his beloved bird. Off-set he helped create Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster and others, including characters for 22 foreign versions of Sesame Street. </p>
