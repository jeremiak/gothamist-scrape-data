<p>Hey pescatarians (that means you too, &quot;vegetarians&quot; who eat fish), you are officially on PETA&apos;s radar. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045122/http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-peta-seakittens,0,1126182.story">Newsday</a> is reporting that &quot;in attempt to pressure consumers with guilt, the group wants fish to be rebranded as &apos;sea kittens&apos;.&quot; They&apos;ve launched a website and set up a fact sheet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045122/http://www.peta.org/sea_kittens/">about <em>sea kittens</em></a>, saying they feel pain <em>and</em> affection.</p>

<p>Tara the Tuna and Tony the Trout are two characters who show up in children&apos;s stories on the site, leading some to wonder if the organization is &quot;targeting the emotions of impressionable youngsters.&quot; You can even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045122/http://www.peta.org/Sea_Kittens/game.asp">create your own</a> Sea Kitten, and for the adults who may like to catch their own delicious Tony the Trout&#x2014;there&apos;s a PETA site for you, too, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045122/http://www.fishinghurts.com/">Fishing Hurts</a>. Recently, the organization <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611045122/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/11/peta_denies_140-year-old_lobster_fr.php">freed a 140-year-old lobster</a> from a retirement at City Crab and Seafood.</p>
