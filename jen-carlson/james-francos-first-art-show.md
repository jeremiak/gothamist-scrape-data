Last we checked, the multi-talent was enjoying some gold balls at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521225932/http://gothamist.com/tags/marinaabramovi&#x107;">Marina Abramovi&#x107;</a>&apos;s closing party <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521225932/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/02/bye_bye_ambramovic.php?gallery0Pic=1#gallery">at MoMA</a>, and now he&apos;s... an artist! <em>Of course he is</em>, right? He&apos;s already played one on <em>General Hospital</em>, so it makes perfect sense.<p></p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first we&apos;ve heard of Franco dabbling in the fine arts&#x2014;back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521225932/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/james_franco_discusses_soap_role_de.php">in January</a> he was discussing the possibility of an upcoming performance-art show at Deitch Projects in Long Island City (wherein he would also be filming scenes for his return to <em>General Hospital</em>). However, this is about his first solo art show, which will be at Clocktower Gallery and opens on the 23rd.</p>

<p>The show is titled &quot;The Dangerous Book Four Boys,&quot; and will include sculpture, photography, drawing, film and video&#x2014;it was curated by Alanna Heiss, the founder and former director of P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center. The show will address boyhood and the &quot;sexual confusion&quot; of adolescence&#x2014;spoiler alert: one piece explores a romantic encounter between Spock and James T. Kirk. Hot! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521225932/http://www.popnography.com/2010/06/james-franco-visionary-artist.html">OUT Magazine</a> says this is &quot;just the kind of thing guaranteed to keep the &apos;is he, isn&apos;t he?&apos; speculation alive... we love his devil-may-care attitude.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521225932/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704198004575311181326946698.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTSecondStories">Wall Street Journal</a> (where Franco is a contributor) has a slideshow from the exhibit; he told them, &quot;I like the idea that I can make people look at entertainment in a different way. And to the extent that my public persona allows me to do that, I&apos;m doing it.&quot; So what&apos;s next? He&apos;s writing a children&apos;s book. We hope the moral is: if you are ridiculously good looking and absurdly wealthy, you can achieve all of your goals.</p>
