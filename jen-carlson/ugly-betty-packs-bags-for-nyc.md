However, with Gov. Paterson&apos;s new tax credit program, the show may uproot and make a move east.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124504/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985198.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1">Variety reports</a> that the city may be cast in its own role as early as next season. But just as New York was unhappy about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124504/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/11/ct.php">losing movie money to Connecticut</a>, LA doesn&apos;t want to bid farewell to Betty. If it goes through (ABC hasn&apos;t commented just yet), over 100 employees of the show will be left behind. In the coastal tug-of-war, Paterson&apos;s plan is the strong arm; under it &quot;the percentage of qualified film production costs eligible for a tax credit tripled, from 10% to 30%. New York City chips in an additional 5% tax break.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, production designer Mark Worthington <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124504/http://www.seenon.com/blog/2007/01/post_27.php">discussed the &#x201C;New York scenery&#x201D;</a> that the show uses, which is all created digitally. Blue screens and computer imaging, along with &quot;high definition digital video of New York City that was pre-shot and then superimposed,&quot; all make up the faux-NY. Fun fact: Broadway &amp; 3rd in downtown Los Angeles looks exactly like Queens!</p>
