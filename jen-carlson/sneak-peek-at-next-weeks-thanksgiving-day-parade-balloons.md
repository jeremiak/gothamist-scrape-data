<p>We&apos;ve got it on good authority that next Thursday giant, <em>massive</em>, balloon creatures will be descending upon Manhattan. But don&apos;t worry, though our source was uncertain, it&apos;s probably got something to do with the Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Speaking of which, NBC, the network that airs the parade, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231147/http://www.nbcudirect.com/paradeballoons111711/">got the scoop</a> recently with a backstage look at some of the balloons and floats you&apos;ll be seeing next week, and this year features a disembodied Lady Liberty (just her arm)! </p>

<p>The parade begins next Thursday at 9 a.m., when you&apos;re just putting the turkey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231147/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/gothamists_guide_to_the_best_boxed.php">or span</a> in the oven. This year the event turns 85-years-old, and we&apos;ve come a long way since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231147/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/26/flashback_old_time_thanksgiving_day.php">this fish float</a> from the &apos;30s&#x2014;this year will feature a new balloon from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231147/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/tim_burton_will_have_creepy_balloon.php">Tim Burton</a>, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231147/http://social.macys.com/parade2011/?cm_mmc=VanityUrl-_-parade-_-n-_-n#/parade-line-up">all of these creations</a>. If you want to check out the action in person, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231147/http://social.macys.com/parade2011/?cm_mmc=VanityUrl-_-parade-_-n-_-n#/parade-route">the route</a> starts at Central Park and 77th Street, following Central Park West, and eventually landing at Macy&apos;s Herald Square, about two miles from the starting point.</p>

<p>The real action, however, is the night before, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231147/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/24/panda_spidey_thanksgiving_parade_ba.php">the balloons are inflated</a> by the American Museum of Natural History. We&apos;ll follow up with a map and details later!</p>
