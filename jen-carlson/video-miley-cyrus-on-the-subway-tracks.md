<p>MTV has been announcing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154425/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/25/mtv_vmas_taking_place_in_brooklyn_f.php">their VMA acts</a> via Instagram and Vine because that is a very young and hip thing to do and Kids These Days have no attention span, but their latest act got a professional video treatment that was shot underneath NYC (or on a sound stage that looks like it). Because fire. And it&apos;s got <em>everything</em>: Miley Cyrus on the subway tracks, the aforementioned fire, graffiti, and probably twerking.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154425/http://idolator.com/7475659/miley-cyrus-vmas-mtv-video-music-awards">The network</a> describes the &quot;plot&quot; as &quot;a band of punk-chic mole people in a Brooklyn subway tunnel as Beastie Boys &apos;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&apos; plays [and Miley] descends from a ladder, snarls at the camera.&quot; </p>
