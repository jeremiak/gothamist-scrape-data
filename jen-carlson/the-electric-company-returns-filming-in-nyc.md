<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081124/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/arts/television/12elec.html?pagewanted=1&amp;adxnnlx=1210708887-1xsDtcnItxpKT%20rpoiRL4g">The NY Times</a> reports that the the show will be &quot;refitted for the age of hip-hop and informed by decades of further educational research on reading.&quot; In addition, it will reportedly be accompanied by interactive online elements and community outreach projects. The weekly program, scheduled to hit small screens in January 2009, also promises to be &quot;more danceable&quot;! Not much else will be changing, though:</p><blockquote>Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit media corporation formerly known as the Children&#x2019;s Television Workshop, will once again produce. As before, when the show began in 1971, it is still directed at viewers 6 to 9 years old.<p></p>

<p>A cameo has been offered to Rita Moreno, a regular on the original &#x201C;Electric Company,&#x201D; remembered for her show-opening exultation, &#x201C;Hey, you guyyyyys!&#x201D;</p>

<p>In keeping with the original show&#x2019;s ties to theater (many in the cast, like Morgan Freeman, had stage backgrounds), the new head writer is a Tony-Award-nominated playwright and lyricist, Willie Reale, with experience in children&#x2019;s theater.</p></blockquote>The show may make you wish you were 6-years-old again; Reale describes a big city natural-foods diner that serves as the headquarters to the Electric Company where four semi-superheroes inside have pledged to eat healthy, practice portion control and, of course, do good. They&apos;re up against The Pranksters, described as &#x201C;neighborhood kids who cause chaos.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Announcements were nostalgia-filled this week, as reports came in that <em>Fraggle Rock</em> would also be returning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081124/http://www.variety.com/VR1117985529.html">Variety</a> noted that the Weinstein Company will turn the series into a live-action musical feature; Ahmet Zappa  is set to executive produce.</p>
