<p>Did you hear about the new transfer at Bleecker Street that the MTA is working on? By 2012, the new station complex will make it easier to transfer from the B/D/F/M to the 6 line&#x2014;it&apos;s going to be &quot;very hip&quot; according to this sign they put up announcing it. But as many, many of our readers have noticed, the agency managed to misspell &quot;Bleeker&quot; Street in their signage. The MTA has been known to let typos get through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141208032911/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/16/nyc_transits_top_typos.php">in the past </a>, and at least this one wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141208032911/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/09/subway_typo.php">set in tile</a>, and at least the MTA is working on something to make commuting easier for us... but c&apos;mon, Bleecker Street is a pretty historic street you guys!</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the MTA for comment, and Aaron Donovan tells us, &#x201C;We are aware of the error and we&#x2019;re removing the incorrectly spelled signs.&#x201D;</p>
