Where have all the dollar signs gone? To Moscow, of course, who beat us out by 3 billionaires (they have 74 to our 71). </p>

<p>Most of the big buck city dwellers are familiar names: Mayor Michael Bloomberg ($11.5 billion), publishing powerhouses Samuel Newhouse Jr. and Rupert Murdoch ($8.5 billion and $8.3 billion), Donald Trump ($3 billion). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145928/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0324/116.html">John A. Catsimatidis</a> is also on the list, having stuffed his pockets through supermarkets, real estate and oil, he&apos;s currently trying to become New York&apos;s second billionaire mayor. The richest among them, however, is industrialist David Koch -- worth $17 billion! </p>

<p>But why the shift of wealth from New York City to Russia? For one, they have a smaller percentage of long-term capital gains tax. They&apos;re also self-made and don&apos;t depend on Wall Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145928/http://www.nysun.com/article/72443">The NY Sun</a> looks at what this all means, stating, &quot;The price of two nights in the Carlton Suite of Moscow&apos;s Ritz Carlton hotel now costs $10,000. Two nights in the Executive Suite at the Four Seasons in New York is a mere $4,300.&quot;</p>

<p>And not-Forbes rich but still rich people who make more than $1 million/year, State Assembly Democrats are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145928/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/nyregion/06millionaire.html?ref=nyregion">proposing a tax increase of another percentage point</a>, in hopes of raising $1.5 billion more.  </p>
