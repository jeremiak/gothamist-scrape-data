title: A Preview of the Meatpacking Apple Store
---

	
										<p>Last week we all learned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150202103123/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/30/an_apple_in_the.php">the new Apple store</a> would be opening in the Meatpacking District just in time for a holiday spending spree. Since then, eager Mac fans have been stalking the place at night -- trying to get a glimpse into the shiny new tech haven. </p>

<p>Today we went inside for a sneak peak at what has to be the nicest of the three Manhattan stores so far. Upon entering you&apos;ll be greeted on the &quot;Mac floor&quot; by the concierge team, wearing light blue shirts and helping you navigate the three-story shop. There are helpful Applebots just about everywhere, and the store boasts 175 employees in all. Expect patrons and internet-less folk to be surfing the net on the ground floor, while others flock to the staircase. </p>
