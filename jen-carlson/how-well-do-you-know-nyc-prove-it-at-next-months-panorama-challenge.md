This is the 9th year for the event, which caters to the city&apos;s know-it-alls: <p></p>

<blockquote>The Panorama Challenge quizzes participants about our city while laser-wielding tour guides point out clues on the Panorama.  The evening&#x2019;s MC Mike Morgenthal will read aloud the question and teams of 10 (or so) will use those clues as well as musical hints to determine the correct answer.  

<p>Teams may be organized as either a Panorama Challenger or Panorama Pro. Challenger teams are first-timers or those who may not have dedicated their lives to the study of our great city. Their questions will be easier! Pros are returning contestants who are die-hard students of our city&#x2019;s hidden corners&#x2014;and must answer double the number of questions each round (60 total!) </p>

<p>Identify the most locations and your Pro team will join the ranks of legendary past winners when its name is etched on the Panorama Challenge Trophy at the Queens Museum!</p></blockquote>Tickets for the event are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617110750/https://www.artful.ly/store/events/8422">available here</a> for $15 per person, and there will be a free shuttle from the Museum to the Mets-Willets Point 7 stop.
