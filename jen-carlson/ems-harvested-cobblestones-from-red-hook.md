<span class="photo_caption">From EMS&apos;s Facebook page</span></p>

<p>A reader sent along this link to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706143343/http://www.facebook.com/pages/Eastern-Mountain-Sports-SoHo/192565823930?sk=wall">EMS Facebook page</a>, saying, &quot;these photos pretty much sum up how so much of what made NYC unique is giving way to corporations. A big box store bragging on its FB page about &apos;harvesting&apos; Brooklyn cobblestones to use in its window display.&quot; Well, EMS isn&apos;t <em>really</em> a &quot;big box&quot; store, but let&apos;s take a look anyway. The caption on the Facebook photos they posted read: &quot;Cobblestones from Red Hook, BK... some being over 100 years old.&quot; They refer to digging them up (and leaving a massive pothole!) as &quot;harvesting the cobblestone.&quot;</p>

<p>They are allegedly in their window display now, promoting a race in Red Hook they&apos;re hosting this Saturday, which will require cyclists &quot;to have the skills to navigate these sections, and to withstand the rattling equipment and tires.&quot; But... stealing cobblestones from the street can&apos;t be legal, can it? We contacted the Department of Transportation to find out, and to see if EMS received permission to remove the stones from the street. We&apos;ll update when we hear back. </p>

<p>In the meantime, your move, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706143343/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/17/rei_plans_move_to_puck_building.php">REI</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> EMS, specifically the man in the photo, tells us, &quot;These cobblestones were given to me by the manager of a building in Tribeca.  They had been in the basement for many years.  Used for marketing purposes.  The photo is staged.&quot;</p>
