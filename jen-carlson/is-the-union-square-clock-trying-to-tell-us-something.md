Read time going left to right and time coming in the opposite direction. So, if the clock reads 180746***135205 it means that it is 6:07 P.M. (18 hours/07 minutes/46 seconds since midnight) and that there are 5 hours/52 minutes/13 seconds remaining until midnight. The three numbers in between are a blur of moving numbers.  It is like a digital hourglass.</blockquote><p></p>Let that absorb. Now, she notes that the clock &quot;was 52 minutes early yesterday&quot; and wonders where those lost 8 minutes went to. Is it the end of the world as we know it?
