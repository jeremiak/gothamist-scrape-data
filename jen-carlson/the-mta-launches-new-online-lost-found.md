										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0209mtafoundlost.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161715im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0209mtafoundlost.jpg" width="350" height="220" class="image-left"> </span>The MTA has some good news: they&apos;re going to help you find those things you leave behind on the subway or bus (if no one steals them first). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161715/http://www.nypost.com/seven/02032009/news/regionalnews/lost__found_at_mta_e_asier_153334.htm">The NY Post</a> notes that last year &quot;riders lost about 19,000 items on subways and buses - including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161715/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/19/found.php">fake limb</a>, a used cooking pot, and a trumpet - and about 7,980 items were returned.&quot; </p>

<p>The MTA tells us their new web-based Lost &amp; Found claims system gives straphangers &quot;access to an on-line system they can use to inquire about their lost items and receive an e-mailed response. The easy-to-use features of the new program include a handy drop-down menu for the selection of date, subway line and station.  There is also a drop-down menu for a description of the item, including the color, brand name, size, etc.  Additionally, customers can write a text description of their lost item.&quot;</p>

<p>The system has just launched and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161715/http://lostfound.mtanyct.info/lostfound/">check it out here</a>. Maybe the MTA can hold an annual tag sale with all the unclaimed items to help out with that whole budget problem.</p>
