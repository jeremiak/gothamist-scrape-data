They serve up some of, if not \<em\>the\<\/em\>, best fake me around, and even offer lunch specials starting at just $6.50 (with a main course, and some extras, like a pumpkin slice, spring roll, and miso soup).

Personally, we order delivery to the office at least once a month, and lately have been addicted to the Crispy Pepper Soy Protein (breaded medallion of sauteed soy protein with savory tomato sauce over kale).
