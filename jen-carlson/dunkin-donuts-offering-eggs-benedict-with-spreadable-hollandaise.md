<p>Hollandaise sauce is an emulsion of egg yolk and liquid butter, seasoned with lemon juice, salt, white pepper and sometimes even some cayenne. It is delicately whisked together, and the slightest wrong move could turn the entire sauce into an inedible glob. You have seen this sauce on your asparagus, but it&apos;s best known for its appearance on your Eggs Benedict... which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507232913/https://staging.dunkindonuts.com/content/dunkindonuts/en/menu/food/sandwiches/breakfastsandwiches/egg_benedict.html">Dunkin&apos; Donuts will now be offering</a> as they get into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507232913/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brunch-on-the-go-dunkin-donuts-introduces-eggs-benedict-breakfast-sandwich-248196081.html">the brunch game</a>. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>Executive chef Stan Frankenthaler told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507232913/http://www.businessinsider.com/dunkin-donuts-new-eggs-benedict-sandwich-2014-2#ixzz2uuds9Od9">Business Insider</a> that he wanted to turn the popular sit-down brunch item into a portable meal. But how will they handle the sauce?  He admits &quot;the biggest innovation challenge was creating the Hollandaise spread&quot;&#x2014;SPREAD!&#x2014;&quot;The key was to create something that wasn&apos;t messy and could be applied to the English Muffin very quickly.&quot; In order to do that, he made spreadable sauce, close to the consistency of cream cheese... which &quot;employees are used to putting on bagels very quickly, so this is no different.&quot; But, Stan, maybe this <em>should be</em> different?</p>
