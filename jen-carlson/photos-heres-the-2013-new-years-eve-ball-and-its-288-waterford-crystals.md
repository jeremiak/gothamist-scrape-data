</div></div>					<p>The &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108174617/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/20/photos_lucky_13_lights_arrive_in_ti.php">lucky 13</a>&quot; arrived in Times Square last week, and now the New Year&apos;s Eve Ball is getting prepped for the big night. Today the 288 new Waterford crystals were installed at One Times Square, where Dick Clark&apos;s widow, Kari Clark, was on hand. </p>

<p>Aside from the crystals, the ball contains 32,256 LED lights, and this year the light source in the Ball is 88% more energy efficient than in previous years, requiring only 22 watts of power. Some more fun facts:</p><ul><li>The Ball consumes the same amount of energy per hour as it takes to operate just two traditional home ovens.<br>
</li><li>The numerals will consume the same amount of energy per hour as it takes to operate just one 40 gallon home water heater. <br>
</li><li>Red, green, blue and white LEDs in the Ball create a palette of more than 16 million vivid, vibrant, and highly-saturated colors as well as billions of possible lighting effects.<br>
</li><li>The Ball is a geodesic sphere, 12 feet in diameter, and weighs 11,875 pounds.<br>
</li><li>Since 2009, the Ball has been on display atop One Times Square year round.</li></ul>If you won&apos;t be there for the big night, you can always check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108174617/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/new-years-eve/about-the-new-years-eve-ball/index.aspx">The Centennial Ball Light Show</a>&#x2014;&quot;a spectacular five-minute light show at :05, :25 and :45 minutes&quot; at the Times Square Museum &amp; Visitor Center.<p></p>
