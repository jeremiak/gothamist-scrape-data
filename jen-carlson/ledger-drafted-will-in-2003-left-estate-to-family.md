The figure includes about $100,000 in bank accounts, a $25,000 Toyota Prius and $20,000 in furniture and fixtures.</p>

<p>Those numbers, however, do not reflect the size of Ledger&apos;s estate. There may be some property holdings in Australia and money tucked in trusts. At the time it also seems unclear whether he or Michelle Williams owned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072641/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/18/this_just_in_he.php">their Brooklyn townhouse</a>.</p>

<p>The will was drafted in 2003, two years before <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> hit the big screen and before Williams was in his life, which leaves her and their 2-year-old daughter out. However, Kim Ledger (Heath&apos;s father) says, &quot;Matilda is our absolute priority and Michelle is an integral part of our family. They will be taken care of and that&apos;s how Heath would want it to be.&quot;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072641/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03092008/news/regionalnews/heaths_daughter_to_get__101002.htm">the NY Post reports</a> Heath&apos;s uncle is &quot;concerned about the distribution of funds for Matilda because of the way Kim handled Heath&apos;s grandfather&apos;s estate.&quot;</p>

<p>The documents filed also showed that the family has reportedly spent more than $39,000 on Ledger&apos;s memorial service at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, including a $25,000 casket.</p>
