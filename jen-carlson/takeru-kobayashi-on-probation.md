<p>Hungry for some more details about the most important competitive eating court case in the history of the sport? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143210/http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/08/05/kobayashi.hot.dog.case/?hpt=Sbin">CNN</a> reports that Takeru Kobayashi may be a free man after his court hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143210/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/kobayashis_case_gets_dismissed.php">on Thursday</a>, but that&apos;s only provided he stays out of trouble for the next six months. Not too bad considering he was charged with resisting arrest, trespassing, obstruction of governmental administration <em>and</em> disorderly conduct after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143210/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/tsunami_strikes_kobayashi_arrested.php">storming the stage</a> at this year&apos;s annual Nathan&apos;s Famous Hot Dog Eating Competition on Coney Island. The deal is sitting well with Kobayashi, who declared, &quot;I am very happy. It was a more nervous victory than winning the eating contest.&quot; He&apos;ll be celebrating with a pizza eating contest in Ontario, Canada later this month.</p>

<p>His competitors aren&apos;t speaking out against him, however. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143210/http://www.tmz.com/2010/08/05/takeru-kobayashi-pat-deep-dish-bertoletti-nathans-hot-dog-court-competitive-eating/">TMZ</a> spoke to Patrick &quot;Deep Dish&quot; Bertoletti, who says, &quot;I think the charges against [Kobayashi] were somewhat legit, and he should have been convicted on at least the resisting arrest charges.&quot;</p>
