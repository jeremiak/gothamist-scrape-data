<p>Forest Hills High School graduate Paul Simon will return home for a concert this summer&#x2014;this will be the music legend&apos;s first time playing Forest Hills Stadium in forty years. Simon &quot;grew up in the beautiful, leafy suburb of New York City at the corner of 70th and Metropolitan,&quot; according to the stadium&apos;s exciting announcement, and it&apos;s where he &quot;attended Forest Hills High School in the early 1950s and where he and fellow student and neighbor Art Garfunkel&quot; worked on their music and gave themselves an ampersand.</p>

<p>As a duo, the two played the Queens stadium in 1967 (with The Doors opening!), and again in 1970, which was their final show together for about a decade. There&apos;s some delightfully aged audio in the below videos, where you can hear a few tunes as well as banter with the crowd. </p>

<p>Simon, sans Garfunkel, will return on June 30th, and tickets (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128183853/http://www.foresthillsstadium.com/paul-simon-vip/">including VIP</a>) will go on sale February 27th (or the 22nd, if you have an Amex card). The show will likely be a nostalgic one, but Simon is also about to release his 12th studio album, <em>Stranger to Stranger</em>, so don&apos;t expect to be fully transported to the past.</p>
