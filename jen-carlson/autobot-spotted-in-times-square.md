<p>Forget all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509224845/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/just_call_it_little_ital-bee.php">bee swarms</a>, there&apos;s one huge bumblebee in Times Square! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509224845/http://www.ripleysnewyork.com/">Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not!</a> tells us the Transformers have invaded, and an 8-foot version of Bumblebee, made completely of recycled car parts, is about to be unveiled this Friday. Here&apos;s a sneak peek of the autobot, which was hand-crafted in Bangkok, Thailand by artist Anchalee Saengtai. Is there a DIY autobot movement happening in Brooklyn yet?</p>
