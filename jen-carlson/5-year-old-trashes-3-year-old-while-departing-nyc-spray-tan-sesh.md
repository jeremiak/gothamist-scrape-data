<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="tmzpageant1211.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022241im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/tmzpageant1211.jpeg" width="325" height="267" class="image-right"> </span>Remember that little girl who got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022241/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/07/parenting_101_dont_dress_your_kid_u.php">dressed up like a prostitute</a> by her mother for a beauty pageant? This is what happens when you put a show like &quot;Toddlers &amp; Tiaras&quot; on the television box, America. Anyway, the 3-year-old got a verbal smackdown from 5-year-old pageant queen Isabella Barrett recently. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022241/http://www.tmz.com/2011/12/22/toddlers-and-tiaras-hooker-outfit-isabella-barrett-paisley-dickey/#.TvOfzyNWq-0">TMZ reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>5-year-old Barrett was leaving a spray tanning sesh in NYC when she went off on 3-year-old Paisley Dickey for allegedly copying her spray tan ways. Barrett told TMZ ... &quot;Last time I was here, Paisley was trying to copy me... but MY mom doesn&apos;t dress me up as a hooker.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Her answer, as you can see in their video below, was clearly fed to her by her mother, who is off-camera, and the website asks, &quot;What mother in her right mind would teach her 5-year-old daughter to say another little girl dresses like a sex worker?&quot; Good question! Here&apos;s another: what kind of people stalk 5-year-old girls in salons with video cameras?</p>
