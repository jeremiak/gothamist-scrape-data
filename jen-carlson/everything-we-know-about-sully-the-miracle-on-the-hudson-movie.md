title: Everything We Know About 'Sully,' The Miracle On The Hudson Movie
---

	
										<p>On September 9th, the feature film about the plane that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/plane_crash_in_hudson.php#photo-1">landed in the Hudson River in 2009</a> will come to theaters. This is what we know about it so far...</p>

<p><strong>The Trailer</strong></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjKEXxO2KNE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>From the trailer I learned three things:<br>
</p><ul><li>No one warned Captain Chesley Sullenberger that this would happen&#x2014;Tom Hanks-as-Sully declares very dramatically that, &quot;No one warned us... no one said, &apos;You are going to lose both engines at a lower altitude than any jet in history.&apos;&quot; It would be really weird if someone gave this very specific warning! We can conclude that Sully never said this IRL.<br>
</li><li>There was an untold story behind the Miracle on the Hudson&#x2014;simulations showed that Sully could have made it back to the airport. <em>Dun dun dun</em>. &quot;It is a big part of the story that people don&apos;t know,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofDzbPXBxP4">says director Clint Eastwood</a>. It wasn&apos;t enough that a commercial airplane was safely brought down for a landing on the Hudson River right alongside New York City during a very chaotic, emergency situation. All the passengers were safe! It was called a miracle because it kind of was! But Sully sure went through a lot of shit after he saved those lives. And that&apos;s what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://www.lifezette.com/popzette/sully-raises-the-hero-question/">this movie is about</a>.<br>
</li><li>Do flight attendants really chant this when a plane is going down?: &quot;Brace brace brace! Heads down, stay down. Brace brace brace! Heads down, stay down.&quot; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/https://airwaysmag.com/capnaux/new-sully-movie-how-accurate/">Airways Magazine</a>, this is &quot;100% accurate for the brace commands at the time.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>The Production</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_09_updatedsully.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_09_updatedsully.jpg" width="640" height="262"> <br> <i> Uh oh, here come the accuracy police!</i></div> <p></p>

<ul><li>While principal photography was done in New York City, the movie filmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2015/10/15/sully-starring-tom-hanks-moves-from-nyc-to-atlanta/">in Atlanta</a> &quot;where a building in downtown Atlanta was transformed into a NYC hotel.&quot; Additional filming took place in North Carolina, Los Angeles, Holloman AFB, New Mexico and Kearny, New Jersey. Because of this, representations of our skyline aren&apos;t exactly accurate. But this is <em>a character film</em>, just pay attention to Tom Hanks.
</li><li>When <em>Sully</em> was filming in Los Angeles, a replica of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://gothamist.com/tags/flight1549">U.S. Airways Flight 1549</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://www.vvng.com/giant-movie-prop-for-miracle-on-hudson-to-be-transported-from-victorville/">made a road trip</a> from Arizona to Universal Studios in Hollywood. The jetliner was placed &quot;on the back of a trailer, and transported down highway 395, onto the 15 freeway, and eventually the 210 freeway before reaching it&#x2019;s new home at Universal Studios Hollywood.&quot;
</li><li>It was filmed almost entirely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/clint-eastwood-sully-imax-1201758250/">with IMAX cameras</a>.</li></ul>

<p><strong>The Reality</strong></p>

<ul><li>The landing occurred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/plane_crash_in_hudson.php#photo-1">on January 15th, 2009</a>, taking place in the Hudson River, around Piers 88 and 92 (West 48th-West 52nd Streets. By 6 p.m., then Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Paterson addressed the media. It was then that Paterson said, &quot;We had a Miracle on 34th Street, now, I believe, we have a Miracle on the Hudson.&quot;
</li><li>The incident happened because, about three minutes into the flight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549">at 3:27 p.m. EST</a>, &quot;the plane struck a flock of Canada geese during its initial standard instrument departure climb out from LaGuardia... the bird strike caused both jet engines to quickly lose power.&quot;
</li><li>Passenger Jeff Kolodjay had recalled the incident: &quot;All of a sudden the captain came on and he told us to brace ourselves and probably brace ourselves pretty hard. But he did an amazing job&#x2014;kudos to him on that landing.&quot; He had explained, &quot;About three or four minutes into the flight the left engine just blew, fire and flames came out of it and it just started smelling a lot like gasoline.&quot;
</li><li>The incident led to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213162152/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/12/threat_to_aviation_safety_2000_city.php">geese culling</a> at area airports.</li></ul>

<p>A few cameras caught the landing:</p>
