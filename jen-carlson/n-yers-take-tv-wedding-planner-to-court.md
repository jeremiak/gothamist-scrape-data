title: NYers Take TV Wedding Planner To Court

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="tutera0110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203145im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/tutera0110.jpg" width="250" height="220" class="image-left"> </span>This celebrity wedding planner, who we kind of thought was Jerry O&apos;Connell at first glance, just got served a lawsuit after ruining one couple&apos;s big day. David Tutera, who is the star of We TV&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203145/http://www.wetv.com/my-fair-wedding/slideshows"><em>My Fair Wedding</em></a>, allegedly screwed over the lovebirds who are now taking him to court.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203145/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/couple_sues_celebrity_wedding_planner_jd1R0otCe6BGXRYofhd84N">the NY Post</a>, bride Melissa Chin and groom Steve Choi said they were left at the altar by the planner, who they say intentionally sabotaged their wedding. The $200,000 suit states that Tutera &quot;defrauded and intended to inflict severe emotional distress on (Chin and Choi) through his gross and irrational actions by taking advantage of their generosity and failing to fulfill his contractual obligations to plaintiffs on their most important of days: their wedding day.&quot; It goes on to say he failed to attend their wedding in Singapore after they paid him to be there, and he specifically instructed certain subcontractors to not fulfill their obligations for the wedding.&quot; Worst wedding planner ever (allegedly)! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203145/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2010/02/01/2010-02-01_celebrity_wedding_planner_david_tutera_ditched_us_at_the_altar_after_pocketing_2.html">The Daily News</a> reports that all in all they paid him a $100,000 deposit, and provided him with four round-trip business-class tickets from New York to Singapore.</p>

<p>Anyway, the couple was left with pretty much nothing... not even a VIP round table, and the whole ordeal has caused them &quot;severe emotional distress.&quot; Tutera&apos;s rep, however, says the couple missed their final payment deadline. When he couldn&apos;t get through to the bride and groom to collect payment, a call was put in to the bride&apos;s father, who Tutera says told him: &quot;Don&apos;t get on the plane. There is no more money. We can&apos;t afford this wedding.&quot;</p>

<p>The two did end up tying the knot, in style at that&#x2014;their wedding photos can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203145/http://journalisticmoments.blogspot.com/2009/08/steve-melissa.html">here</a>.</p>
