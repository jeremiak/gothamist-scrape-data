										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="123float1112.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144158im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/123float1112.jpeg" width="350" height="228"> <br> <i style=" width:350px; ;display:block"> via Muppet Wiki</i></div> This year the Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade will still include its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144158/http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Macy&apos;s_Thanksgiving_Day_Parade">123 Sesame Street float</a>, which annually features some of the cast and Muppets of <em>Sesame Street</em>. Following the recent scandal that blew up around Elmo&apos;s voice actor and puppeteer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144158/http://gothamist.com/tags/kevinclash">Kevin Clash</a>, we asked Macy&apos;s rep Orlando Veras if Elmo would still be allowed to appear this year. <p></p>

<p>Veras told us this afternoon that Elmo &quot;will absolutely join us in the Parade... under an alternate puppeteer.&quot; He added:</p><blockquote>&quot;Sesame Street has been a cherished part of the Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade for almost 40 years and will continue to be part of the Parade for years to come. Current events have no bearing on Sesame&apos;s participation in the Parade and we are confident their world-renowned, family-friendly entertainment and educational programming will continue to bring kids and families joy for decades to come.&quot;</blockquote>Last week Clash was accused of having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old, Sheldon Stephens, and today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144158/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/20/2nd_accuser.php">a new accuser</a>, Cecil Singleton, stepped out with his own claim that he had sex with Clash when he was 15-years-old. Following today&apos;s allegations Clash resigned from <em>Sesame Street</em>, saying, &quot;I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately.&quot;<p></p>
