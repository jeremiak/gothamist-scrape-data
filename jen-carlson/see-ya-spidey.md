										<p><a href=" http://www.gothamist.com/2007/04/02/your_friendly_n_1.php">Spider-Man Week</a> is coming to an end. What happened out there while we weren&apos;t looking? In one of the more interesting spider events this week, Tobey Maguire got a big creature placed on his arm at AMNH by entymologist and curator Norm Platnick:</p>

Through Sunday you can check out that very same spider at AMNH, as part of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180344/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/specials/spider/?src=h_h">Spiders Alive! exhibit</a>. 

</p><p>Did you see any signs of Spider-Man this week? <a href=" http://www.flickr.com/photos/muckster/478845369/">Here he is in Midtown</a>, on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180344/http://allday.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/04/30/175141.aspx">Today Show with Bloomberg</a>, and last summer <a href=" http://www.flickr.com/photos/akinyc/161217302/">there were signs everywhere</a>! Earlier this week we posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180344/http://www.gothamist.com/2007/05/02/spidey_week.php">a map</a> of all the Spidey action that&apos;s taken place. But all this hype hasn&apos;t seemed to work on the critics, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180344/http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/movies/04spid.html?ref=arts">NY Times</a> reviews the third installment, saying: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;Aesthetically and conceptually wrung out, fizzled rather than fizzy, this latest installment in the spider-bites-boy adventure story shoots high, swings low and every so often hits the sweet spot, but mostly just plods and plods along, as if its heart were pumping tired radioactive blood.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Have you seen the movie yet, is it better than the first two? And if you need more Marvel in your weekend, today is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180344/http://blogs.usatoday.com/popcandy/2007/05/free_comic_book.html">Free Comic Book Day</a>!</p>
