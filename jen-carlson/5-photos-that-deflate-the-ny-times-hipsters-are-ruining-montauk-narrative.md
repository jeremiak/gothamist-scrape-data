</div></div>					<p>Over the weekend The NY Times turned their heads from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160626075223/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/wythe.php">Wythe Avenue</a> to focus on the end of The End: Montauk. In an article titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160626075223/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/fashion/montauk-feels-the-effects-of-too-many-hipsters.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=style">Montauk&#x2019;s Hipster Fatigue</a>, The Hipster is now blamed for Montauk&apos;s transformation from blue collar to deep v-neck. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160626075223/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/montauk.php">earlier this year</a> the Gray Lady blamed the hamlet&apos;s soulless demise on a creeping case of Hamptonsization, some anti-fedora signs have them believing public enemy #1 is now The Hipster. Writer Jim Rutenberg says: &quot;it&#x2019;s really about those who wear the hat... the fedora featured in the signs represents your basic hipster. And to some extent, it&#x2019;s just part of what is shaping up as a countrywide anti-hipster movement.&quot; (Code Orange, hipsters!)</p>

<p>These aren&apos;t any ordinary hipsters, mind you, these are Ninja Hipsters&#x2014;Rutenberg says &quot;the whole [hipster] look provides cover for a more privileged crowd that is intent upon importing to your neighborhood higher real estate, food and drink prices.&quot; </p>

<p>If the NY Times is going to anecdotally declare that the hipster is ruining Montauk over one photograph of an anti-fedora sign, then surely we can prove or disprove this with our own &quot;research.&quot; Under the theory that Instagram is a portal into the Hipster Eye, we turned there for recent photos of Montauk... and lo and behold, we found more images of regular, non-hipster types ruining the area. Or maybe these are a new <em>new</em> breed of Ninja Hipsters, who dress like Joe Douchebag for their sleepy hamlet takeovers. Clearly, we can&apos;t close the file on this case yet...</p>
