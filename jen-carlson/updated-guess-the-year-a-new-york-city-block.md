<p>It&apos;s been a while since we challenged you with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050316/http://gothamist.com/tags/guesstheyear">Guess The Year</a> post, so here we go. Can you guess what year, and even better, where this photo was taken? We&apos;ll update later with the date, location, and a photo of what this area looks like now.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This photo was taken on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050316/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=5th+avenue+and+55th+street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.761179,-73.974273&amp;spn=0.005819,0.015793&amp;sll=40.761667,-73.974914&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,211.83,,0,26.89&amp;cbll=40.761672,-73.97491&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=5th+Ave+%26+W+55th+St,+New+York&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;panoid=Fx-43mcpnMS0v8vf9dHI1g">the west side of 5th Avenue</a>, between 54th to 55th Street, in 1923.</p>

<p>A little tidbit about 5th Avenue during that time: a year prior to this photo, the city had just &quot;reacted to complaints about the ongoing replacement of Fifth Avenue&apos;s mansions by apartment buildings by restricting the height of future structures to 75 feet, about half the height of a ten-story apartment building. Architect J. E. R. Carpenter brought suit, and won a verdict overturning the height restriction in 1923,&quot; arguing that &quot;the avenue would be greatly improved in appearance when deluxe apartments would replace the old-style mansions.&quot; On the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120405050316/http://collections.mcny.org/">Museum of the City of NY</a>&apos;s site, these buildings are listed as apartment buildings. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the next block, between 56th and 55th Streets, from the east side:</p>
