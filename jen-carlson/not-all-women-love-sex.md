<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145230/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/movies/02sex.html?ref=movies">The NY Times</a> reports that the romcom&apos;s success was mostly thanks to the fairer gender, with 85 percent of the ticket buyers on opening night being women (Warner Brothers reports that more men began showing up over the weekend, however).</p><blockquote>&#x201C;It is kind of mind-boggling,&#x201D; Sarah Jessica Parker, the &#x201C;Sex and the City&#x201D; star, said in a telephone interview from her Manhattan home on Saturday. <p></p>

<p>&#x201C;We are thrilled and humbled that the audience came out. I am so excited about the possibilities for movies about women.&quot;</p></blockquote>The powers that be are <em>already</em> in talks about a sequel -- but will it just turn into a big screen version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145230/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/04/new_yorks_real_1.php"><em>The Real Housewives of New York</em></a>? Just as women take a step towards changing preconceived notions of their role in keeping Hollywood afloat on opening weekends (which is <em>so</em> important), the movie itself takes a giant step back for womankind! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145230/http://jezebel.com/5012292/i-like-sex-i-like-this-city-i-hated-sex-and-the-city">Jezebel</a> reports back from the theater with a scathing review, characterizing the silver screen version of the foursome as &quot;fools,&quot; &quot;rich bitches,&quot; and &quot;assholes&quot; who are self-centered, rude to their help, and full of unflattering attitude. <p></p>

<p>The perfect accessory to all the frenzy is a story about SJP herself; seems her dress from the New York premiere <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145230/http://gawker.com/tag/disasters/?i=5012187&amp;t=dress+whoring-scandal-snares-sex-star">wasn&apos;t very original</a> after being worn out by others (including Lindsay Lohan, no less) despite the designer telling her that wouldn&apos;t happen. While she called it &quot;unethical and disappointing that they would allow the dress to be worn again,&quot; Gawker counters by pointing out the unethicality of overselling a movie premiere to fans in order to create a nice PR buzz.</p>
