										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="owilde1109.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213232im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/owilde1109.jpg" width="341" height="350" class="image-left"> </span><em>New York-born actress Olivia Wilde may garner some attention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213232/http://www.gq.com/women/photos/200909/olivia-wilde-video-photos">for her looks</a>, but the 25-year-old also has quite a resume under her belt. You may know her as Thirteen on the television show House, you may have seen her around town while she was filming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213232/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/12/action_on_s_4th.php">the Black Donnelleys</a>, or you may just have spotted her browsing the Brooklyn Flea. Currently she&apos;s promoting the film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213232/http://fixthemovie.com/">Fix</a>, which her husband (who is a real life prince, by the way) Tao Ruspoli directed. It opens at the Village East tomorrow, and earlier this week she told us a little bit about the film, her favorite books, and where to get the best taco in the city.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did the idea for <em>Fix</em> come about?</strong> We were driving up the 405 in Tao&apos;s 59 Thunderbird, bouncing ideas back and forth for our first collaborative film project, when Tao started telling me the story of one day with his little brother, which became the skeleton for the story of <em>Fix</em>. I have always been fascinated by Tao&apos;s family, who are all interesting and eccentric, and I loved the idea of bringing this story to the screen. It&apos;s completely unique, and only Tao could tell it with the empathy and humor the film exudes. </p>

<p><strong>The film just premiered in New York the other night &#x2014; how was the reception, and how has it been so far overall?</strong> The reception of the film, all over the world in over 35 film festivals, has been extraordinary. Audiences have a great time watching the film, and often have a very emotional response to its raw honesty. Anyone with experience with addiction in their families seems to recognize the honest portrayal of the frustration, and often the futility, involved with trying to change someone you love.</p>
