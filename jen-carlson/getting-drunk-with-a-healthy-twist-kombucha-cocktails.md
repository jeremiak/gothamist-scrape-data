<p>This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104656/http://www.vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=3767&amp;catId=7">Veg News</a> suggests you Spike Your Spore, which basically means you add alcohol to your already <em>slightly</em> alcoholic (0.5 percent) kombucha. This sounds counterintuitive, but we like to spike <em>everything</em>, so we&apos;re in. While the site declares the drink is &quot;a natural choice for subbing&quot; in for <em>real</em> alcohol, they also seem to give the all clear on mixing it with the hard stuff. So let&apos;s skip over the PG-rated stuff and get right to the kombucha cocktails that can get you drunk:</p>

<p>For the purists, you can also just mix in some kombucha with your vodka soda, and plenty of people enjoy it with a little whiskey. Or if you prefer your cocktails shaken and stirred for you, there&apos;s a kombucha bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104656/http://www.tasteliveculture.com/bar.html">up in Ithaca</a>.</p>
