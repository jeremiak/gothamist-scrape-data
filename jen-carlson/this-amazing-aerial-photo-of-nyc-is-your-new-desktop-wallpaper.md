<p>If the recent heatwave and permeating hot garbage scents that signal another summer in the city have been getting you down recently, this refreshing photo of New York City should sustain your love of the place until things cool off. The aerial image was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073610/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/w98ze/new_york_city_by_screencapping_a_360_panorama_on">created by a Redditor</a> who screengrabbed the capture from a 360&#xB0; panorama&#x2014;and it&apos;s simply gorgeous.
