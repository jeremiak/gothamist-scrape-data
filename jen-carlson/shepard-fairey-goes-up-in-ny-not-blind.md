title: Shepard Fairey Goes Up in NY; Not Blind
---

	
										<p>Last summer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421004632/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/21/interview_shepa.php">Shepard Fairey</a> was in town installing his exhibit at the Jonathan LeVine Gallery in DUMBO; new pieces also went up around the streets of Brooklyn during that time. </p>

<p>This past week, after a report came in that Fairey was going blind as a result of his diabetes, a whole new slew of his pieces went up (check them out below); while some thought, &quot;for a blind guy, he&apos;s sure getting up,&quot; others questioned if the original rumor was true. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421004632/http://animalnewyork.com/news/2008/05/no-end-in-sight-for-shepard-fa.php">Animal</a>, the source of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421004632/http://animalnewyork.com/news/2008/05/is-this-the-end-of-shepard-fai.php">the original story</a>, says that once contacted, Fairey &quot;vehemently denied that he&#x2019;s losing his vision.&quot; However, he has had problems, and even surgery, in the past. He added that: &#x201C;[W]hen I was in NY last summer for my show at Jonathan&#x2019;s, I just had a bleed in my right eye and the whole time I was working on that show I only had partial vision in my right eye. But, I was still able to work, I could still paint and cut, and do what I need to do.&#x201D;</p>
