	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phplT6Vl4PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723014817im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phplT6Vl4PM.jpg" width="326" height="350" class="image-right"> </span>This Wednesday evening in Times Square, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723014817/http://gothamist.com/andrewwk">Andrew W.K.</a> will attempt to break the world record for (drumroll please): Longest Drum Session in a Retail Store. He explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723014817/https://www.facebook.com/events/199433616881254/permalink/199433620214587/">on Facebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Over the years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723014817/http://www.omusicawards.com/nominee/andrew-w-k">the O Music Awards</a> have played host to world-record setting efforts like Chiddy Bang&apos;s 9-hour, 16-minute freestyle and the Flaming Lips&apos; superhuman eight-show effort. But both of those endeavors pale in comparison to what profound partymeister Andrew W.K. has in store... he&apos;ll attempt to set a new (and very specific) world record of his own: Longest Drum Session in a Retail Store.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Shake off the disappointment that he isn&apos;t going for the world record in Partying The Hardest or Wearing The Most White All At Once, <em>or both at the same time</em>. The challenge is actually harder than partying hard... he&apos;s going to have to drum for 24 HOURS. He told MTV, &quot;Despite my apparent confidence, inside I am actually a very small, trembling shell of a person, who is not only intimidated, but completely mortified and horrified by the ramifications of this challenge. When I signed up for it, I was like &apos;Alright, 24 hours of drumming!&apos; and then it started to set in: 24 hours of drumming. Just drumming for an hour&#x2014;just drumming for 24 seconds&#x2014;can be quite intense... I can&apos;t even play one of my own songs on the drums all the way through without my arms burning.&quot;</p>

<p>You can watch Andrew W.K.&apos;s arms fall off starting this Wednesday at 7 p.m.&#x2014;he&apos;ll be inside Oakley&apos;s flagship Times Square store, or you can check in on him at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723014817/http://OMusicAwards.com/">OMusicAwards.com</a>. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723014817/http://www.forbes.com/sites/charlesambler/2013/06/17/andrew-wk-to-attempt-drumming-world-record-at-o-music-awards/">Forbes</a>,  Questlove will join in for the first portion of the 24 hours.</p>
