As such, he has single-handedly reinvented the timeless sound we often hear on the street during the summer, some with a tinge of nostalgia, some sprinkled with noir and all leaving you wanting seconds.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Do you ever approach random trucks and give them your cd?</strong><br>
Actually, I have on a few occasions, but it usually turns out to be fruitless.  For some reason I tend to be drawn to the least likely candidates&#x2014;disenchanted old men who barely speak English and stare at me with utter confusion as I hand them my CD. &quot;Seriously, you can play this on your truck.  I&apos;m giving it to you for free.  It&apos;ll sound good, I promise!&quot;  For the most part, the ice cream trucks that have been using my music have all approached me, and very few of them are in New York.  It seems Mr. Softee has a bit of a stronghold here, with their trademarked jingle.  But that&apos;s fine, the album wasn&apos;t really written for just ice cream trucks.  It&apos;s also supposed to be a fun album for anybody to listen to at home, in their car, at the office, wherever.  It works especially well as a children&apos;s record.</p>

<p><strong>What instrument do you think is best for an ice cream truck song?</strong><br>
In my opinion, for both practical and aesthetical reasons, I&apos;d say high-end instruments seem to work best for ice cream truck music; things like the glockenspiel, accordion, various chimes, bells, etc. The speakers on most ice cream trucks are generally quite small, therefore it&apos;s important not have music that&apos;s going to sound distorted when played.  Also, high-end sounds carry much better through the air and can be heard for several blocks, which is sort of the whole point, right?  It was also my intention to write songs that were in the vein of what we already think of as ice cream truck music. I didn&apos;t want to totally go off the deep end and write a bunch of music that wouldn&apos;t make any sense coming from an ice cream truck, ie. heavy metal, rap, punk-rock.  That said, I did write some fairly complex songs that have several key changes, diminished chords, and other geeky elements.  I also used some rather unusual instruments<br>
like the Claviola and theremin&#x2014;instruments that I use quite often with my regular band, One Ring Zero.  In fact, the music is not all that unsimilar to the stuff you would hear on an ORZ record.  It&apos;s just a bit dumbed-down, perhaps, simpler and not as poppy.</p>

<p><strong>Are you doing any collaborating with Matt Allen, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521053323/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/28/matt_the_ice_cr.php">Ice Cream Man</a>?</strong><br>
Yes, Matt has become a really great ally in this whole ice cream adventure.  He first contacted me about a year or two ago after seeing my myspace page.  I sent him some of the early demos, which he began using on his truck.  Whenever he&apos;s in New York, we team-up on things: giving away free ice cream, and promoting &quot;Songs For Ice Cream Trucks.&quot;  Good times!</p>
