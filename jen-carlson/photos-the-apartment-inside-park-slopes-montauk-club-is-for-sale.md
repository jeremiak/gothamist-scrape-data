</div></div>					<p>Were you aware that there&apos;s a beautiful apartment inside of the Montauk Club in Park Slope? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200956/http://narrative.ly/keep-calm-and-carry-on/a-club-for-the-un-clubabble/">anti-elitist club</a>, located on 8th Avenue, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200956/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/16/the_montauk_club.php#photo-1">a fantastic history</a> of its own, even without being housed inside of such an aesthetically pleasing old building. But let&apos;s get down to brass tacks: this apartment is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200956/http://www.halstead.com/sale/ny/brooklyn/park-slope/25-eighth-avenue/condo/9653704">only $5 million</a>. </p>

<p>Sure, <em>all of us</em> don&apos;t have $5 million, but some people do! And for those people, this seems like a steal. (Note to those people: don&apos;t forget who <em>told</em> you about this steal! Don&apos;t forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200956/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRWAQ255qhs">about ol&apos; Gil</a>! We&apos;re quiet, you won&apos;t even notice we&apos;re there.)</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="FLOORPLANmontaukclub.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200956im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/FLOORPLANmontaukclub.jpg" width="640" height="368" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The home is located on the (entire) fourth floor of the historic building, and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200956/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/25/live_amid_brooklyns_loveliest_stained_glass_windows_for_5m.php">Curbed</a> just came back on the market. The listing states that the 5-bedroom, 4200-square-foot &quot;masterpiece&quot; is built from the Club&apos;s original Ballroom, and boasts stained-glass windows, a private terrace with views to Prospect Park, 3 original fireplaces, 12 foot ceilings, mahogany woodwork, &quot;expansive entertaining areas and quiet, intimate corners,&quot; a Chef&apos;s Kitchen, heated floors, &quot;a master bath with a luxurious copper tub,&quot; and other things we&apos;ll never have. </p>

<p>For the rest of us, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200956/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/bushwick_mansion_rent.php">there&apos;s always that 1-bedroom in Bushwick</a>.</p>
