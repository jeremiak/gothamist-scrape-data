The comic illustrator and writer&apos;s work has been on New Yorker covers, in the complete collection of Charles M. Schulz&apos;s classic comic strip Peanuts, on an Aimee Mann cd cover, in the NY Times magazine, and of course in his own works like Palooka-ville. This week Seth and fellow illustrator Adrian Tomine will bring their book tour through New York (Thursday at the Strand and Saturday and Sunday at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520084238/http://moccany.org/">MoCCA</a>). He recently told us about what he&apos;s working on now, spending his last day on earth at the Whitney, and the dangers of changing ones name when going through a goth phase.</em></p>

<p><strong>You&apos;re about to start a book tour, is there any one thing that fans ask you the most? </strong> The number one question I receive is &quot;When is Clyde Fans, Book two&quot; coming out.   It is a deeply shaming question because I have been working on this book for years and I still have a couple of years work ahead of me to finish it.  It makes me look bad.  But honestly&#x2014;I&apos;m working on it right now!</p>

<p><strong>Does everyone call you Seth? When/why the name change?</strong> Yes, Everyone.  I changed my name for the most pretentious of reasons back in the eighties when I was punky/gothy youth  and wanted a scary name.  I forced everyone to use the new name&#x2014;even my mother.  I would relentlessly correct anyone who accidentally used my real name until it became second nature to everyone. </p>

<p>I&apos;m not so crazy about the fake name now. Be careful what you wish for because you might get it. </p>

<p><strong>How do you feel about comics and graphic novels becoming feature films&#x2014;would you ever experiment with that medium?</strong> It&apos;s fine with me , but of no more interest that the novel to film path.  The only important fact is whether or not it&apos;s a good film.   Usually they end up as different animals.   If someone wanted to film my work I wouldn&apos;t be opposed to the idea.   Especially if they were a good director or had a lot of cash to give me.   I wouldn&apos;t want to be much involved myself.  I love film but I am not an aspiring filmmaker.  I&apos;d rather stay home and work on my comics.</p>
