On May 13th they released their second album on Atlantic, their seventh in total, called Narrow Stairs, and tomorrow night they play a sold out show at McCarren Park Pool. Last week Ben Gibbard talked to us about the new album, the old days, and a questionable recipe for peanut butter veggie sausage toast.</em> </p>

<p><strong>How does <em>Narrow Stairs</em> differ from your previous work?</strong> I think it&apos;s far more loud and more raw than the last handful of records. I think there are some things on it that are certainly more reminiscent production-wise of some of the older albums, given the fact we did it on 2-inch tape and did a lot of it live, and there are a lot more guitar tunes on it this time. I&apos;m really proud of it, I think it turned out well.</p>

<p><strong>What motivated the choice to record it that way, on the 2-inch tape?</strong> While we didn&apos;t want to admit it to ourselves at the time, I think the nerves were running a little bit active, given the switch to Atlantic and trying to anticipate everyone&apos;s moves. I think we just kind of, between records, all of us independently decided this is something we wanted to do, and it would make for a lot more inspired record and would certainly be more fun to make.</p>

<p><strong>So do you feel like this album establishes your harmonious relationship with Atlantic? Have you settled in?</strong> I don&apos;t think we had a bad relationship to begin with, but after seven years of dealing with a label that was four people and a desk in Seattle, Washington...I think whenever you start a new relationship you have to learn to communicate with those people and you have to suss out their motivations and you have to learn how to dance around each other to get what you want, and vice versa. You know, I think that we&apos;ve become a lot less guarded in our relationships with them because we realize that, at least with our band, they have our best interests at heart and have allowed us to make two records in a row now completely independently. </p>

<p><strong>Now that you&apos;re so well known do you feel that the internet world doesn&apos;t effect you as much as younger bands because you&apos;re so established now?</strong> I certainly think that we don&apos;t live and die by it. I think if our first record were coming out now I think maybe the trajectory of our career would be determined a little earlier and quicker than if things hadn&apos;t happened the way they have over the past 10 years. One of my favorite quotes comes from Mike Watt and he says, &quot;You can&apos;t blame everyone for not being born at the same time.&quot;</p>

<p>The way things are now, some bands you wish would be more successful are not given the opportunity directly because of a lack of insane internet buzz. Or maybe some bands that you&apos;re not feeling all of a sudden become huge and you&apos;re wondering, &quot;Why does everybody think this band is the most amazing band ever?&quot; But I think that time will be the great equalizer on all of these things. I think bands that are truly meant to have formidable careers together... you can weather just about anything.</p>
