<p>Do you like to rock the saggy pant style but are worried that you&apos;ll end up flashing someone, or worse, experiencing unwanted skin-to-subway-seat contact? Well fear not, low riding pant wearers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130615191343/http://sagzjeans.com/">a new denim company</a> based out of New Jersey is here to save the day. </p>

<p>Sagz was started by three brothers out of Newark, whose goal was to create jeans with the boxers built in. They explain on their website, &quot;Our patented concept consists of high-quality jeans that sag naturally. <strong>Consumers can &apos;sag&apos; their jeans at different levels without having to constantly pull up their pants, resulting in more time to be active, express themselves and show their SWAG.</strong>&quot; The full Sagz package starts at around $85.</p>

<p>Anti-sag campaigns have been rampant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130615191343/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopthesag">over the past year</a>, with one Harlem man even creating &quot;a mashed-up device that is half garter belt, half suspenders, which regulate how low-slung your pants will sag.&quot; But it remains to be seen if true &quot;saggers&quot; will adopt any of this new technology&#x2014;personally, they strike us as purists.</p>
