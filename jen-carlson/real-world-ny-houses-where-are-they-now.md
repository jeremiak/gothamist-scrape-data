</div></div>					<p>Word is that you can now rent the brick warehouse on Pier 41 in Red Hook, which was transformed into a home for 2008&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160910174720/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/05/real_world_part_two.php">cast of <em>The Real World: Brooklyn</em></a>. The building has now been exorcised of its reality television demons, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160910174720/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2011/03/17/now_anyone_can_party_in_a_former_real_world_house.php#pier-liberty-warehouse-1">transformed again</a>, this time into a $195-a-head wedding venue and banquet hall called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160910174720/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2011/03/17/now_anyone_can_party_in_a_former_real_world_house.php#pier-liberty-warehouse-1">Liberty Warehouse</a>. Each Bah Mitzvah and sweet sixteen held there will undoubtedly be more entertaining than an episode put forth by the Brooklyn cast.</p>

<p>We might as well revisit the other Real World NYC homes while we&apos;re at it, both in Manhattan (think the show will ever make it to Queens, Staten Island, or the Bronx?). In 2001 the cast moved into an 8,000-square-foot, four story building at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160910174720/http://632onhudson.com/">632 Hudson</a> (also now available for events!). The West Village building has been around since 1847, and used to be a sausage factory. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160910174720/http://www.realworldhouses.com/realworld10.html">this site</a>, the cast &quot;only&quot; inhabited 5,000 square feet, on the 3rd and 4th floors including the Penthouse Level and Roof Deck, which were both renovated for the filming.</p>

<p>The Hudson Street loft was just 1.2 miles from where it all began, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160910174720/http://www.realworldhouses.com/realworld1.html">the SoHo Loft</a> used for the filming of the first season. That apartment was located at 565 Broadway and wasn&apos;t an entire building, but a unit (#2C). Allegedly &quot;walls separating two adjacent apartments on the second and third floors were removed in order to form a single 4,000-square-foot, four bedroom residence. Production personnel, which included up to 13 people at one time, utilized a work space with a separate entrance.&quot; And with that... where it all began: </p>
