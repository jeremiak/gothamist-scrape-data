<p>It&apos;s perhaps a sign of the times&#x2014;and a changing neighborhood demographic&#x2014;when a music venue in Williamsburg closes and no one seems to notice. In December <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034811/http://gothamist.com/tags/publicassembly">Public Assembly</a> on North 6th Street shut its doors after six years (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034811/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/26/galapagos_is_now_public_assembly.php">in 2008</a> it took over the space from Galapagos). Did YOU hear?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034811/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/williamsburgs-public-assembly-has-shuttered-its-doors">Time Out</a> there was no official announcement, little fanfare, and it just went quietly into the night. A new bar called Black Bear, which has no online presence outside of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034811/http://instagram.com/blackbearbar">an Instagram account</a>, lives there now... and they have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034811/https://oaknyc.com/blog/williamsburg-black-bear-bar/">Old Fashioneds on tap</a>.</p>

<p>We reached out to one of Public Assembly&apos;s former owners, Matt Roff, to find out what happened and will update when we hear back. In 2012 Roff&apos;s other venue, Southpaw, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034811/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/27/whats_really_happening_to_park_slop.php">closed in Park Slope</a>.</p>

<p>RIP Public Assembly, here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034811/http://gothamist.com/tags/henrywolfe">Henry Wolfe</a> to play you out, from our Northside Festival show held there in 2009:</p>
