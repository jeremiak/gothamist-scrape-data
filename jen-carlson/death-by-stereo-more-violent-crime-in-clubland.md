The dispute leading up to the shooting began inside, but was eventually taken to the street, where Queens resident Brione Schneider was shot and was later pronounced dead at St. Vincent&apos;s Hospital. He was the father of a 6-year old boy, managed a Finish Line sports in Brooklyn and was described by his mother as &quot;a very laid-back guy who was about going to work and taking care of his son...[he] was never a problem.&quot; </p>

<p>Schneider was with his brother and cousin, but no arrests have been made yet and they are reviewing surveillance tapes for clues. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171959/http://www.nysun.com/article/69394">The NY Sun</a> reports that &quot;the three men had gotten into a scuffle on the dance floor, &quot;and had &quot;left the club and were walking west when the shooting occurred, at about 3:45 a.m.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171959/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/01/11/2008-01-11_shooting_death_outside_chelsea_club.html">The Daily News</a> reports that a club employee saw Schneider have &quot;words&quot; with another man in the club, and once outside the other man (at this point in a car) shot Schneider in the back.</p>

The abduction, rape and killing of 18-year old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508171959/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/28/murder_1.php">Jennifer Moore</a> began nearby with a night out at Guest House on W 27th Street. As for Stereo, it was shuttered for 42 days last year after serving minors, and was only reopened on December 5th. </p>
