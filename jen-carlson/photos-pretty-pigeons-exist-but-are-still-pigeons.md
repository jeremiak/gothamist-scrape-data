</div></div>					<p>Why should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140909082038/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/12/post_152.php">dogs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140909082038/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/cat_fashion_show.php#photo-1">cats</a> have all the fun? Just because they are adorable and pigeons are disgusting (sorry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140909082038/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/07/mike_tyson.php">Mike Tyson</a>), doesn&apos;t mean that pigeons can&apos;t strut their stuff, too. Check out these photos from the Grand National Pigeon Show, presented by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140909082038/http://www.npausa.com/">National Pigeon Association</a>, which have been making their way around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140909082038/http://laughingsquid.com/grand-national-pigeon-champions">the internet</a> today. We have no comment, except to say that no matter how much you curl your feathers or hide your face, pigeon, <em>you are still a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140909082038/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/epi/epi-pigeon.shtml">disease carrying</a> flying rat</em>.</p>
