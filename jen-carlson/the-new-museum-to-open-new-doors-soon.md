										<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175431/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/29/looking_forward.php">Last year</a> we started to see renderings of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175431/http://www.newmuseum.org/">New Museum</a>&apos;s new digs on Bowery, and now they&apos;re just about ready to open their shiny new doors. On December 1st (coinciding with the institution&apos;s 30th anniversary) the SANAA-designed building will don the artist Ugo Rondinone&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175431/http://www.faprojects.com/exhibitions/images/83/EXTERNAL_PROJECT_UGO_RONDINONE">HELL, YES!</a> sign, welcoming art patrons city-wide while adding a little chaos to the refined building. Below are some exterior shots (Rondinone&apos;s sign photoshopped on) and a rendering of the interior. <br>

If you haven&apos;t heard of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175431/http://www.designboom.com/eng/interview/sanaa.html">SANAA</a> firm, director of the New Museum Lisa Phillips <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175431/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/skyline/2007/11/19/071119crsk_skyline_goldberger">explained to the New Yorker</a>&apos;s Paul Goldberger that they wanted a new architect to design the building because &#x201C;we thought we should be consistent with our mission of supporting new art,&quot; which led them to the Tokyo-based group. Goldberger describes the galleries at the New Museum as &quot;illuminated in part by natural light (through skylights), have some of the virtues of neutrality but are more inviting than plain white boxes.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the location, in a statement the architects said that &quot;in the end, the Bowery and the New Museum have a lot in common. Both have a history of being very accepting, open, embracing of every idiosyncrasy in an unprejudiced manner,&quot; calling the museum a mixture of &quot;elegant and urban.&quot; </p>
