										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpUJ3R44PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004433im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpUJ3R44PM.jpg" width="299" height="300" class="image-left"> </span>A wealthy Icelandic couple is being sued for installing a cheap <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004433/http://gothamist.com/tags/ikea">Ikea</a> kitchen in their Gramercy Park Hotel pad. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520004433/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/02/24/2010-02-24_posh_icelandic_couple_sued_for_putting_ikea_kitchen_in_swank_gramercy_park_hotel.html">the Daily News</a>, Jon Asgeir Johannesson and Ingibjorg Palmadottir own two apartments in the building, a full-floor co-op and the duplex penthouse above it. The duo rented out the 16th floor to the Paramount Realty Group last year, and now that group is suing them for $52,000, in part because of the &quot;ugly kitchen.&quot;</p>

<p>The suit claims that the kitchen &quot;was not reasonably satisfactory... as it did not rise to the level of a kitchen suitable for a property located at 50 Gramercy Park North. The kitchen has also been a source of embarrassment for Plaintiff and the subject of remarks by guests.&quot; Rich people! </p>

<p>On top of the design faux pas, the suit also claims the unit had faulty air conditioning, a cracked window and missing appliances... as well as chewed up chicken wings on the 2,000-square-foot terrace! Allegedly they were being tossed there by the couple themselves, who reside above.</p>
