I&apos;m stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that&apos;s all there was to read about in the papers - goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn&apos;t help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves. </em></p><em>

<p>I thought it must be the worst thing in the world. </p>

</em><p><em>New York was bad enough.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Thus begins <em>The Bell Jar</em>, a novel whose film adaptation Julia Stiles will star in and produce. Sylvia Plath&apos;s 1950s-era drama centers around Esther Greenwood, who - while spending a summer in Manhattan - grows troubled and eventually descends into mental illness, attempting suicide several times. She likens her depression to being trapped under a bell jar, struggling for breath...this is a dark novel, exploring the dark side of the human psyche. Yet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405064131/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963712.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1">according to Variety</a>, Stiles wants to make the film...lighthearted, and keep focus on the more uplifting elements. Celine Rattray, of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405064131/http://www.plumpic.com/">Plum Pictures</a> (attached to produce the film with Stiles), says &quot;Esther Greenwood has a strong outlook on life, and we&apos;re really looking to bring out the humor in the character. We don&apos;t want to do a depressing descent into the world of suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>Emo bands need not apply for the soundtrack! While we&apos;re curious about how one makes electroshock therapy and attempted suicide uplifting, news of this adaptation is more depressing than the novel itself. </p>

<p>Filming will likely start early next year. To get an idea of Stiles as a producer/director, check out her short film <em>Raving</em> (also produced with Plum Pictures) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130405064131/http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/tff-ep-bacon.html">at the Tribeca Film Festival</a>, which she wrote for Elle magazine&apos;s film series. It stars Zooey Deschanel, and will also air on May 8th on the Sundance Channel. </p>
