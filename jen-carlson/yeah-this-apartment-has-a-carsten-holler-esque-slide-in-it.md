<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406034140/http://gothamist.com/tags/carstenh%C3%B6ller">Carsten H&#xF6;ller</a> slide at the New Museum is now long gone, so there&apos;s only one thing to do about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406034140/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/24/photos_of_the_new_museums_giant_sli.php">the regret we feel</a> from having never gone... and that is to become friends with whoever buys this East Village pad. This penthouse apartment just went on the market, and features a sculptural steel slide that connects the two floors&#x2014;according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406034140/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203960804577239801968916424.html?mod=WSJ_RealEstate_LEADTopNews">Wall Street Journal</a>, it will bring you from &quot;the office with a wet bar on the upper level to the floor below.&quot;</p>

<p>Core, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406034140/http://corenyc.com/425-east-13th-street-ph-fg.html">the listing</a>, notes that &quot;This unique architectural detail was added when Galfond combined a pair of deuces (two two-bedroom units, that is) into what is now a 2,500-square-foot home accessed via private key-locked elevator. There&#x2019;s also a custom Italian-made Rintal staircase for a more traditional path between the upper and lower levels,&quot; for the non-adventurous... because that slide does look awfully steep!</p>

<p>This place&#x2014;located at 13th between 1st and A&#x2014;can be all yours for $3.99 million, let us know when you get the keys, we&apos;re coming over for a test run. The current owner trying to unload the apartment is poker ace Phil Galfond.
