<p>At his Atlantic City concert last night, the 35-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151259/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> pulled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151259/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/29/beyonce_pregnant_with_destinys_or_m.php">a Beyonc&#xE9;</a> and announced from the stage that he will be having a baby with his 32-year-old girlfriend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151259/http://gothamist.com/tags/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>. He reportedly made the announcement by singing: &#x201C;Now you having my baby,&quot; and then told the crowd to congratulate his &quot;baby mom,&quot; declaring this was &quot;the most amazing thing.&quot; <em>Indeed.</em></p>

<p>The two went public with their relationship in April of this year, and started dating just months after Kardashian filed to end her 72-day marriage to Kris Humphries. The reality star and stranger to commitment will now be <em>raising a non-returnable human child</em> with West. Here&apos;s a glimpse of what that may look like: </p>

<p>Other Kardashians quickly wanted to get in on some of Kim&apos;s spotlight, and took to Twitter with their own expressions of joy over the pregnancy: </p>
