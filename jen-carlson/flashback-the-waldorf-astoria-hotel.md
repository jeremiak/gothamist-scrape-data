<p>That year, their room cost at the hotel was $23.10, their restaurant bill was a whopping $3.47 and they made a phone call which racked up an additional 15 cents. These days, the same night would cost around $600 to $800! (The above photos were mostly taken around that time.)</p>

<p>The Waldorf-Astoria has been housed in two historic landmark buildings&#x2014;the first on the Fifth Avenue site of the Empire State Building, and the current one at 301 Park Avenue. Perhaps the most intriguing bit of history is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141008183112/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/08/matt_lauer_goes.php">that secret railway</a>, known as Track 61, which would cater to VIPs (the elevator was even large enough to fit Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos;s car on it). It might be time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141008183112/http://trainjotting.com/2007/02/27/ask-engine-bob-the-secret-platform/">revisit the story</a> about Andy Warhol having a party down there.</p>
