<p>Today Will Ferrell made an appearance on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324040849/http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7416342n">CBS This Morning</a>, and left a little note upon his departure: &quot;Stop the &apos;Call Me Maybe&quot; ... I&apos;m sick of it.&quot; It&apos;s unclear if the CBS studios are pumping this song over the speakers non-stop, or if Ferrell just felt like launching a campaign against Carly Rae Jepsen&apos;s gift that keeps giving and giving and giving... Maybe he just hasn&apos;t heard it with more cowbell yet?</p>

<p>At press time, Mr. Ferrell was unavailable to comment on Gotye&apos;s &quot;Somebody That I Used To Know.&quot;</p>
