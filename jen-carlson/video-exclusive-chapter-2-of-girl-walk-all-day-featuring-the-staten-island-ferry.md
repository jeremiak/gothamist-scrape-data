---

	
										<p>As you know by now, we&apos;ll be exclusively premiering the epic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113210625/http://girlwalkallday.com/watch-the-film">Girl Walk // All Day</a> music video right here on Gothamist, chapter-by-chapter, every Tuesday and Friday through early January. Just a few days ago you saw Chapter 1 of the 72-minute film (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113210625/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/video_exclusive_the_epic_girl_walka.php">revisit it now</a>!) and below is Chapter 2, titled &quot;All Aboard.&quot; This one may look familiar as its the chapter that first introduced us all to the project almost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113210625/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/12/video_staten_island_ferry.php">one year ago</a>, filmed mostly on the Staten Island Ferry. Enjoy, and we&apos;ll be back with the next installment on Tuesday, December 6th (just a couple of days before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141113210625/http://www.kickstarter.com/rsvp">the big premiere</a> at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple).</p>
