										<p>Bad idea pubic hair: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141207130412/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/01/15/2009-01-15_greasy_vandal_in_hate_crime_vs_scientolo.html">The Daily News</a> got word of 18-year-old Matt Connor&apos;s recent Scientology prank involving Vaseline, toe nail clippings, and yes, pubes. After getting all slathered up, Connor (a member of Anonymous, an anti-Scientology group, who told cops his name was Mahoud Samed Almahadin) headed to the West 46th Street Scientology center and &quot;tossed a number of books around, then smeared the petroleum jelly on a TV set, shelves.&quot;  Words don&apos;t really do the scenario justice&#x2014;just watch the video below (though be warned: it&apos;s not for the weak of heart, or stomach).</p>
