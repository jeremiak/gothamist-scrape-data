<p>The narrator of this video, Tim at Cape Night Photography, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160415092712/http://www.capenightphotography.com/2012/10/02/location-walk-through/">gives little away</a> as to why these bits of NYC mass transit ended up in a desert, explaining during his walk-through: &quot;There are three old New York City subway cars... in the middle of the desert, really surreal. Interestingly enough, they&apos;ve been cut in half.&quot; There are also a bunch of New York City buses, and an old &quot;shot up taxi cab&quot; that may or may not be authentic. We&apos;ve contacted Tim (and the MTA) to find out more about these relics and where they reside, and will update when we hear back. Until then, enjoy!:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A spokesman for the MTA tells us, &quot;The subway cars appear to be old R30s from the BMT lines, done up to look like newer models. We think the bus may not be real, however&#x2014;tough to tell.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> Tim tells us the subway cars were in a junkyard in California, but cannot give the exact location due to a nondisclosure agreement. Though he did tell us that he &quot;heard that they are used sometimes television and movie production.&quot;</p>
