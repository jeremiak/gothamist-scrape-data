title: Queens Cruella Cashing In On Sick Puppies

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="queensbreeder.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223043204im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/queensbreeder.jpg" width="225" height="169" class="image-left"> </span>For over a year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223043204/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/shame/queens-dog-breeder-part-4-20100317">Arnold Diaz</a> and his Shame Crew have been on the tail of Queens pet dealer Robin Schulder (pictured). The dog breeder uses various websites to sell puppies nationwide, raking in at least $1000 per dog, and allegedly gets them through a 3rd party&#x2014;though she claims they are from her farm upstate. </p>

<p>The problem is, once they get to their new homes, their new owners realize they are sick. Her dogs have had varying visible signs of illness&#x2014;suffering seizures, and even dying once delivered. Others reached their new homes <em>blind</em>, but Schulder says they weren&apos;t sent in that condition and in turn blames the owners. She also adds this bit of &quot;advice,&quot; saying: &quot;live animals get sick, it&apos;s not the breeder&apos;s fault. If you don&apos;t want an animal to get sick, buy a stuffed animal.&quot;</p>

<p>Now attorney general Andrew Cuomo is on the case, and has filed a lawsuit against Schulder and her husband; he aims to put them out of business and wants them to give refunds to their victims. Video of the Queens Cruella can be found below...</p>
