</div></div>					<p>There&apos;s nothing more satisfying than a rusting piece of our history being pulled from its watery grave. Earlier this year we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141025/http://gothamist.com/tags/generitter">this old bell</a> be dredged up in Coney Island, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141025/http://twitter.com/StatueLibrtyNPS/status/6534022634">Lady Liberty&apos;s Twitter</a> alerts us that the old sunken Ellis Island Ferry has been pulled from the water. They say, &quot;The old ferry, Ellis Island, which carried millions of approved immigrants to Manhattan&quot; has remained sunken at her slip for decades. They note &quot;It is being removed to allow restoration work on the seawall, and improved boat access to the slip.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141025/http://www.lostmag.com/issue7/ellis.php"><br>
Lost Mag</a> has the history of the ferry and its demise, noting it sunk years after the immigration station closed in 1954. They also opine that &quot;a trip to Ellis Island would be enhanced if visitors could stand aboard the same ferry on which their ancestors left knowing they&apos;d soon become citizens.&quot; Alas, it doesn&apos;t look like this ferry will be restored.</p>
