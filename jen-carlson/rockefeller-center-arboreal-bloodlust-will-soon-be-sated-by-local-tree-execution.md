<p>&quot;He was such a quiet tree, really kept to himself,&quot; one Shelton, CT woman (who wanted to remain anonymous) declared, visibly shaken standing in its shadows. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151109152055/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Rockefeller-Tree-Cut-Down--230951031.html">The tree</a>, an imposing 76-foot-tall Norway Spruce, is beautiful, but was chopped down by a team of executioners acting on behalf of Rockefeller Center in New York City.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear what the tree did, aside from providing ample shade on hot summer days, and acting as a suitable perch for local birds and squirrels. But the mood in the sleepy town is mysteriously celebratory, and residents can&apos;t wait until the tree is hauled off to the big city, where it will arrive Friday morning.</p>

<p>There, dead and lifeless, it will be propped up as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151109152055/http://gothamist.com/tags/deadtree">an annual tradition</a> that is not unlike the Salem witch trials. People will gather around its stiff cold body for nearly two months before it&apos;s finally laid to rest, away from the leering crowds, to lay with its demons for eternity.</p>
