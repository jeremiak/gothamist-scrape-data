title: Vuvuzelas Make Brief Appearance At Yankee Stadium

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="0610buzzzzzzzzz.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305172000im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0610buzzzzzzzzz.jpg" width="350" height="249"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Follow the Vuvuzela <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305172000/http://twitter.com/the_vuvuzela">on Twitter</a></span></i></div> If you&apos;ve been watching the World Cup then you are well aware of the incessant buzzing noise that sounds most similar to a swarm of blood-thirsty mosquitoes just seconds away from feasting on your brains. If you don&apos;t achieve deafening drunkeness within the first half, you are in all likelihood hoping for the aforementioned scenario to occur. So just imagine how fun it would be if that noise were happening at Yankees games&#x2014;because surely there&apos;s nothing like experiencing the sound of the vuvuzela in real life surround sound. Luckily, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305172000/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/bronx_blowhards_v3yRWOSPKLLHaIUNFaus1I?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> is reporting we are way too smart to let that happen.<p></p>

<p>The paper reports that when Yankees fan Anthony Zachariadis blew one of the plastic horns at Tuesday night&apos;s game, the stadium&apos;s security team confiscated it immediately. Oddly, the security guards received some boos for the move, which means the masses might actually be <em>for</em> public use of vuvuzelas. These are likely the same people that made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305172000/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/icing.php">getting iced a <em>thing</em></a>. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old Zachariadis told the paper how he pulled off getting the horns in to the stadium, saying, &quot;I hid them in my shorts to get into the stadium, and when I pulled out the horns, the whole place went nuts. Phillies fans would walk by and we would blow it in their ear.&quot; Yes, New York, this man is out there, armed with more &quot;plastic bloody horns,&quot; as fake Hitler calls them.</p>
