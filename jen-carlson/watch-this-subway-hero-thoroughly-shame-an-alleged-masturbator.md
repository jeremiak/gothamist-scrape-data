<p>Masturbating, groping, and general lewdness are not an uncommon sight in our city&apos;s transit system&#x2014;we have a large archive documenting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110703/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaypervert">NYC&apos;s subway perverts</a>, who (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110703/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/22/nypd_subway_pervert_crackdown.php">despite increased enforcement efforts</a>) often get away with their bullshit. If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway system, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110703/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/21/gross_4_train_jorts_balls.php">you should report it</a> to the MTA and police. (More on that below.) The woman who took this video, however, went a different route, publicly shaming the perv until he slinked off the subway car. </p>

<p>&quot;Get the fuck off this train with that freaky shit,&quot; she demands. &quot;You wanna rub your dick, you rub your dick when you get off the motherfuckin&apos; train, do we understand each other?&quot;</p>

<p>The video&#x2014;which Deanna Carter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110703/https://www.facebook.com/deanna.carter.3914/videos/vb.100004134492158/668026926678451/?type=2&amp;theater">uploaded to Facebook</a> along with the words: &quot;HE BETTER HOPE I NEVER SEE HIS NASTY ASS AGAIN!&quot;&#x2014;goes on for two minutes, and is supremely gratifying. Carter is a hero.</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on, etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110703/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. Don&apos;t let the perverts win.</p>
