It bears a resemblance to Apple&apos;s famous logo -- a resemblance Apple says infringes on its trademark.&quot; </p>

<p>While Mother Nature was unavailable for comment, rumor is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811102426/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/26/city_unveils_gr.php">Partridge Family bird</a> has been chirping about a trademark infringement case himself. In the meantime, NYC &amp; Company officially applied to trademark their apple logo early last year, as Apple filed a formal opposition. In turn, NYC &amp; Company have filed a counterclaim asking that the infringement complaint be dismissed. This could go on forever...but experts say it will likely be resolved in 9 months. The next step is to survey people&apos;s reaction to the new logo, to see whether Apple&apos;s complaint can hold up.</p>

<p>Apple (who have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811102426/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/18/hark_the_apple.php">planted</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811102426/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/06/a_preview_of_th_1.php">their seed</a> all over town) is saying that the logo used by the city will &quot;seriously injure the reputation which [Apple] has established for its goods and services.&quot; </p>
