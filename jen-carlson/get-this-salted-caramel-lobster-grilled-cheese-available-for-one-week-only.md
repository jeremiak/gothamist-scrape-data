<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173831/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/12/its_national_grilled_cheese_day.php">National Grilled Cheese Day</a> is this Friday, but there should be an entire holiday for this one grilled cheese alone. What you are looking at is a Salted Caramel Lobster Grilled Cheese, and it features all of those things <em>in one hand-held food item</em>. We haven&apos;t tried it yet, but even though it doesn&apos;t feature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173831/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/ramps_have_arrived_celebrate_with_t.php">ramp pesto</a> it seems rather life-changing. Rather like it might make you believe in God. And love. And everything good in the world. And unicorns. And a metabolism that never slows.</p>

<p>The $22 offering comes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507173831/http://www.hudsoncommonnyc.com/">Hudson Common</a> (356 West 58th Street) and its full name is the Salted Caramel Angry Lobster Fatty Melt. It&#x2019;s made of Yancy Farms White Cheddar Curds, Brooklyn Salvatore Smoked Ricotta, 2 Sisters Gouda, Tickler Cheddar, Fromage Blanc, Prairie Breeze Cheddar, and Butter Milk with Red Chili-Chipotle Lobster Salad with a caramel drizzle atop the sandwich to finish it off. This is one of those rare, over-the-top, gluttonous items that is so insane that you cannot feel guilty about indulging in it.</p>

<p>The sandwich (which is so much more than just a sandwich) will only be offered for a limited run of one week, starting this Friday the 12th.</p>
