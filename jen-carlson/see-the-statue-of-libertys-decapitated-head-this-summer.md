<p>Each year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141652/http://gothamist.com/tags/figment">FIGMENT</a> takes over Governor&apos;s Island, and this summer they&apos;ll be back over there for a sixth time, from June 9th through the 12th. We&apos;ll have a more comprehensive guide to the free event coming up next week, but we were particularly drawn to this rendering of Lady Liberty&apos;s decapitated head stuck in the green grass. <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141652/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muEnLlycOn4">Damn you, you maniacs</a>!</em></p>

<p>This is part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141652/http://newyork.figmentproject.org/long-term-exhibitions/2012-interactivesculpture-garden">their sculpture garden</a>, and according to the press release, the &quot;Face of Liberty is a 1:1 scale face of the Statue of Liberty, made of fiberglass and weatherized. The head will be facing upward, as if the statue were lying down. It will look like it is rising up, or sinking into the ground. The visual effect will be similar to someone submerging his/her head in a bathtub, leaving hair, eyes, nose and cheeks above water. The work allows viewers to see the famous statue at a new angle.&quot;</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141652/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/why-is-lady-libertys-torch-in-madion-square/">Ephemeral NY</a> posted a photo of another unusual angle of the Statue today, taken in the late 1800s when the Lady&apos;s hand and torch sat &quot;in front of the western side of Madison Square... from 1876 to 1882 to get enough donations from Americans to complete the pedestal (the statue itself was the financial responsibility of the French).&quot; For more old photos of the dismembered statue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141652/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/the_statue_of_liberty.php">check these out</a>.</p>
