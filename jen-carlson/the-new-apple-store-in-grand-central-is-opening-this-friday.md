<p>The newest NYC Apple Store in Grand Central has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144440/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/23/grand_central_apple_store_not_openi.php">covered up in a black box</a> for a while now, and the company has just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503144440/http://www.apple.com/retail/grandcentral/?cid=CDM-US-DM-P0011066-180156&amp;cp=em-P0011066-180156&amp;sr=em">announced</a> that they&apos;ll finally be unveiling it (just in time for holiday shopping) this Friday, with an opening at 10 a.m. The 23,000-square-foot store is the largest Apple store in all the land, and we&apos;ll try to find a way in there (anyone have a chainsaw?) for a sneak peek before Friday to see how they utilized all that space (sadly, there will be no cube).</p>

<p>Store hours will be Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. They&apos;ll also be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, for you last minute shoppers.</p>
