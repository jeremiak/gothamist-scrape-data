Lipton explains his foree into the seedy side of street life saying, &quot;This was when I was very very young, living in Paris, penniless, unable to get any kind of working permit... I had a friend who worked in what is called the Milieu...this young woman and I, we made a rather good living, I must say.&quot; We may now have to actually read his new book, <em>Inside Inside</em> - where he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175541/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-lipton20oct22,0,641702.story?coll=la-headlines-calendar">also reveals</a> his life with gypsies, and his role on <em>Guiding Light</em>. Who knew?!<p></p>

<p>Inside the Actors Studio was filmed at The New School until their contract ended in 2005; it&apos;s now filmed at the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University.</p>
