<p>As we previously mentioned, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119052028/http://gothamist.com/tags/manhattanhenge">Manhattanhenge</a> will be returning tonight for its penultimate appearance this year. Tonight the full sun will align perfectly with Manhattan&apos;s grid system, bringing anyone with an Instagram account to the middle of busy intersections. There are four Manhattanhenge experiences a year, the previous two were in May, and the remaining two are this week: </p>

<p><u>Full Sun</u><br>
Monday, July 11th at 20:20</p>

<p><u>Half Sun</u><br>
Tuesday, July 12th at 20:20</p>

<p>The event was named and noticed by Neil deGrasse Tyson, who declared it to be &quot;a unique urban phenomenon in the world, if not the universe.&quot;</p>

<p>Tuesday night&apos;s Manhattanhenge, the final one of 2016, will be followed by a discussion at AMNH&apos;s Hayden Planetarium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119052028/http://www.amnh.org/calendar/manhattanhenge">with astrophysicist Jackie Faherty</a>, because deGrasse Tyson is too famous for his Manhattanhenge now.</p>
