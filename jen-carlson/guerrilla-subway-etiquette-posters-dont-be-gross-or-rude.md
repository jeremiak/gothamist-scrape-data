<p>Now here are some subway signs we support! Artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://www.jayshells.com/">jayshells</a> surveyed people on their top (non-MTA related) pet-peeves while riding the subway, and instead of taking the complaints <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/subway_douchery_brings_up_undergrou.php">to the internet</a>, he&apos;s addressing them offline. </p>

<p>He told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/04/artist-promotes-subway-etiquette-with-guerrilla-campaign">Animal</a>, &quot;I narrowed the results down to the top ten most occurring issues and rewrote them as a sort of list of rules. I designed posters in the style of the Service Changes posters we see everyday and silkscreened about 40 of each (400 total) and am currently putting them up on trains throughout the city, throughout this week. I encourage people to look out for them, and to take them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/31/omg_mta_annoyed_at_wfps_wtf_posters.php">before the MTA does</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The top ten: nail clipping, religion, noise pollution, physical contact, hygiene, disregard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/30/pregnant_women_find_subway_seats_ha.php">seating priority</a>, garbage disposal (or lack thereof), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/train_pigs.php">eating</a>, subway stair etiquette, and... hmm, looks like one is missing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/peeing_inside_the_subway_train_a_vi.php">Subway peeing</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131640/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/28/freaky_photoshop_or_really_revoltin.php">Naked lapdances</a>?</p>
