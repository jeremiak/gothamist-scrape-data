<p>This weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410035114/http://gothamist.com/tags/lenadunham">Lena Dunham</a> will take over at Studio 8H as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410035114/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/finally_lena_dunham_to_host_snl.php">host of <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>. Will she live up to her Vogue title of the new Queen of Comedy?
