<p>Joss Whedon&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175538/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2364582/"><em>Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></a>, based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., will premiere on ABC in September, and the first trailer was just released. While there are connections to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175538/http://gothamist.com/tags/theavengers">the Avengers</a>, Whedon &amp; Co. have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175538/http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/14/joss-whedons-s-h-i-e-l-d-isnt-avengers-prequel-abc-confirms/">made it clear</a> in the past that this world stands on its own&#x2014;&#x201C;There are characters in it who clearly come from Avengers. So it&#x2019;s part of the world, but we&#x2019;re going to be very, very careful that we don&#x2019;t tread on the toes of the features and build a whole new world. [Whedon&apos;s] built a world for us.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The show will take place in a time after the Battle of New York (seen in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175538/http://www.imdb.com/news/ni43772179/"><em>The Avengers</em></a>), which you&apos;ll hear mention of in the trailer... which mostly makes us think that it would be cool to have secret superheroes all over New York.</p>

<p>The show will have a Tuesday at 8 p.m. timeslot, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175538/http://www.slashfilm.com/marvels-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-extended-trailer-revealed-series-to-air-tuesdays-this-fall/#more-175980">it has tested very well</a>, with much credit to Whedon, who &quot;knows how to create great television with great relationships at the heart of it.&quot;</p>
