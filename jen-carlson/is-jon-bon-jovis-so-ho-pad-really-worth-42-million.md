<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511001215/http://gothamist.com/tags/jonbonjovi">Jon Bon Jovi</a> has put his 7,400-square-foot SoHo duplex on the market, and is trying to unload it to the tune of $42 million (which is around $18 million more than he paid for it in 2007). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511001215/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/2471951">Corcoran listing</a> for the Mercer Street pad notes it has 5 bedrooms, 5.5 baths, a patio, a wood-burning stove, a zen garden sans Bed of Roses, two chefs kitchens, a private screening room with projection room, and expansive views. It also comes fully furnished and with a personally recorded parody of &quot;It&apos;s My Life&quot; by Jon Bon himself, called &quot;It&apos;s My Loft.&quot; Take in to account that the last part is not true, and that the furniture is mostly brown velvet... worth it? For comparison, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511001215/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/07/insane_dumbo_clocktower_apartment_o.php#photo-1">the clocktower penthouse in DUMBO</a> is a bargain $18 million.</p>
