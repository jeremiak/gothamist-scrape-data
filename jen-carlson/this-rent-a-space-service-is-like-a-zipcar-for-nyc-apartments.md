<p>Earlier this week we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235617/https://twitter.com/julien/status/437959737292754944">saw a Tweet</a> regarding some strange new service called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235617/http://breather.com/">Breather</a>, which is described as &quot;a network of beautiful city spaces that you can unlock at any time.&quot; Kind of like that dream where your apartment has an extra secret room you never knew about? Sort of. Think of it as a Zipcar for NYC apartments. The service has just come to the city, and we asked the creator for some details. </p>

<p>Breather&apos;s NYC City Manager, Packy McCormick, tells us the spaces can be used for anything: meetings, yoga (each space has a yoga mat), reading, a nap, &quot;or just to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a little while.&quot; Or, you know, Other Stuff wink wink. Seriously though, aren&apos;t people just going to use this for sex? McCormick insists that &quot;having already seen months of usage [during the beta phase], we know it just doesn&apos;t happen.&quot; Ignorance is bliss. And anyway, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235617/http://breather.com/faq">their FAQs</a>, the spaces are cleaned after every use.</p>

<p>Each space has free WiFi, a desk, a couch, chairs, and plenty of other surfaces for not sex.</p>

<p>The cost of renting a space is $25, with the very first hour on the house. You can use the space for 30 minutes or an entire day. Currently their spaces are in SoHo, Flatiron and near Penn Station and MSG, with more coming soon. </p>
