<p>When you see what appears to be a children&apos;s plastic toy house on Craigslist renting for $500 a month, and located in someone&apos;s backyard in Greenpoint, you begin to wonder if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014114/http://www.theonion.com/articles/84-million-new-yorkers-suddenly-realize-new-york-c,18003/">this Onion article</a> was for real. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014114/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/22/trailer_parks.php">Bushwick trailer parks</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014114/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/tent_city_brooklyn.php">dudes living in tents</a>, and now an 8&apos; x 10&apos; Rubbermaid shed being rented as a studio apartment?! The listing has been removed, so either the ladies trying to cash in on what appears to be their smoking shed found a renter, or found a conscience.
