										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="conanpremiere1110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165936im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/conanpremiere1110.jpg" width="200" height="194" class="image-left"> </span>The Late Night Drama that started nearly a year ago has come as full circle as it&apos;s going to, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165936/http://gothamist.com/tags/conanobrien">Conan O&apos;Brien</a> back on television as a host. He returned with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165936/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/conan-debuts-with-some-self-mockery/">self-mockery</a>, and high ratings last night&#x2014;drawing more viewers than both Jay Leno and David Letterman. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165936/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/conan-premiere-beats-leno-letterman-43317">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, 4.2 million tuned in to Conan&apos;s new TBS show, while 3.5 million sticking with Leno, and 3.4 with Letterman; he also triumphed over Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. As the site points out, however, O&apos;Brien&apos;s stint on the <em>Tonight Show</em> started high as well, but dropped more than 50% from his premiere within a week. </p>

<p>If you weren&apos;t one of the 4.2 million to tune in last night, catch up online&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165936/http://stereogum.com/570322/jack-white-played-the-conan-premiere/top-stories/lead-story/">Stereogum</a> has a rundown of the music highlights (featuring Jack White), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165936/http://www.tbs.com/video/conan.jsp?oid=233887&amp;eref=sharethisUrl">TBS</a> has the full episode, and there&apos;s a bunch of extra stuff over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165936/http://www.teamcoco.com/">Team Coco</a>. Can the drama that played out earlier this year, and made Conan a Late Night Hero, keep his show going strong?</p>
