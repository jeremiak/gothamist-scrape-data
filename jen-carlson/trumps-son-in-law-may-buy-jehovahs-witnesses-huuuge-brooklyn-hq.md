<p>The Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses have been preparing for their exodus from Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO, and last year they put their enormous building on Columbia Heights <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314081242/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/04/jehovahs_witnesses_selling_off_big.php">on the market</a>. A stone&apos;s throw from Brooklyn Bridge Park, the property&#x2014;which sports that massive &quot;WATCHTOWER&quot; sign&#x2014;sits on some coveted land. And now it&apos;s reportedly getting a new owner: Donald Trump&#x2019;s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who owns The Observer and is married to Ivanka and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314081242/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/jared_kushner_not_good.php">is hated by many of his tenants</a> in the East Village.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314081242/http://nypost.com/2016/04/13/jehovahs-witnesses-lock-down-deal-for-700m-brooklyn-plot/">the NY Post</a>, there&apos;s a handshake deal with Kushner and developers Aby Rosen and Livwrk&#x2014;&quot;The pricing is roughly $700 million for the Witnesses&#x2019; 733,000-square-foot world headquarters at 25-30 Columbia Heights and a 1.1-million-square-foot as-of-right development site at 85 Jay St.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314081242/https://www.jw.org/en/news/releases/by-region/united-states/jehovahs-witnesses-sale-move/">The trio has purchased</a> JW properties in the past, forming &quot;Dumbo Heights&quot; and building a tech-hub and &quot;mixed-use urban campus.&quot; It&apos;s unclear what their intentions for the Watchtower would be, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314081242/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/17/dtg-watchtower-kushner-sale-2016-04-15-bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a> notes that &quot;the vacant lot at 85 Jay St. is one of the few spare tracts of land in the pricey &#x2019;hood zoned for residential use.&quot;</p>

<p>The properties are currently still listed as being for sale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314081242/https://www.watchtowerbrooklynrealestate.com/">on the JW&apos;s real estate page</a>. We&apos;ve reached out to Robert Warren in their press office for more information and will update if we hear back.</p>
