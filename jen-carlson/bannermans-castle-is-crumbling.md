<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919033433/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/14/bannerman_island.php">Last year</a> a group of intrepid explorers made their way over to Bannerman&#x2019;s Castle, photographing the crumbling site, which in 1967 was sold to New York&apos;s Taconic State Park Commission. The castle was crumbling then, but as of last week it&apos;s suffered even more damage.</p>

<p>Located 50 miles north of the city, in the Hudson River, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919033433/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/nyregion/30castle.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> reports that last Saturday night the castle began to fall apart, destroying two-thirds of the eastern tower and part of an adjacent southern wall. One 99-year-old Bannerman, Jane, told the paper from her Park Avenue apartment: &#x201C;I knew it was going to happen, because it looked so frail. Over the years, I have painted various stages of its decay.&#x201D; The castle has already sustained a fire, and now with a gaping hole and the structure falling apart, there&apos;s concern over how to stop the deterioration. </p>

<p>The Bannerman Castle Trust founder, Neil Caplan, says, &#x201C;We know that the structures had been precarious, no matter what, and they could have gone at any time. This is the only castle of its kind, and we&#x2019;re losing it. This is such an important piece of the Hudson Valley. We want to save what&#x2019;s there.&#x201D; Caplan&apos;s plan was to use money collected through grants and fund-raising to restore the residence in 2010 &#x2014; but with the new damage there may not be enough. He won&apos;t be able to assess the damage until next week.</p>
