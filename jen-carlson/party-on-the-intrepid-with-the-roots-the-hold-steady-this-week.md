<p>Remember that top secret concert on the deck of the Intrepid that we a little prematurely announced back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013255/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/party_on_the_intrepid.php">in April</a>? Well it&apos;s just been launched into the public eye, with plenty of details and surprise: it&apos;s this Thursday! The free concert (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013255/http://partyontheintrepid.com/">RSVP here</a>) will feature sets from The Roots and The Hold Steady; food trucks; photobooths and an awesome view. So if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013255/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/did_you_score_radiohead_tickets_or.php">didn&apos;t get</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013255/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/radiohead_tickets_going_for_800_on.php">Radiohead tickets</a>, now you have a place to go.
