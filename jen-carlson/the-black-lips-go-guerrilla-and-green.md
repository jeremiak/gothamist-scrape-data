<p>Atlanta band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195239/http://www.myspace.com/theblacklips">The Black Lips</a> better tell their street team the correct date of their upcoming Bowery Ballroom show. The above posters were spotted around the East Village (a clever guerrilla marketing campaign), but some of the dates are wrong! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195239/http://copyranter.blogspot.com/2008/03/black-lipsthis-is-how-you-do-guerrilla.html">Copyranter</a> calls out the &quot;lazy hipsters&quot; for the inconsistency, but in the end it&apos;s a nice way to be a little &quot;green&quot; while promoting shows. </p>

<p>P.S. - The Bowery Ballroom show is Monday March 10th. They play The Music Hall of Williamsburg on the 11th.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Sharpie artist was caught in the act...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629195239/http://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanblitz/2311897438">defacing a Human Giant ad</a>!</p>
