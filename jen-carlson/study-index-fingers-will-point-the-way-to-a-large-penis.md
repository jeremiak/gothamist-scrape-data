Anyway, you know what they say about the size of a man&apos;s foot? Well, throw that knowledge away. It means nothing now that a new study has come out showing that the size of a man&apos;s penis can be determined by the ratio of the length of his index finger to that of his ring finger. The lower that ratio, the longer the penis! Math! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510033111/http://www.patspapers.com/story_stack/item/what_a_short_index_finger_you_have/">Pat Kiernan</a> puts it like this: &quot;men with index fingers shorter than their ring fingers on the right hand tend to be better endowed than those with longer index fingers.&quot; He also calls back the &quot;sexy ratio,&quot; noting that men with a smaller ratio are also more attractive to women because of their symmetrical faces.</p>

<p>This comes from a urologist in Korea who studied 144 men, all of whom had their two fingers measured and then the members measure &quot;immediately after the subject had been anesthetized... when the penis was flaccid and when it had been stretched as much as possible.&quot; (Hey, is that an index finger to ring finger ratio in your pocket or were you just under anesthesia and having your penis stretched out?)</p>

<p>Conspiracy theory fodder: how is this connected to Megan Fox&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510033111/http://www.buzzfeed.com/reddit/megan-fox-toe-thumb-pic">toe thumb</a>? Discuss.</p>
