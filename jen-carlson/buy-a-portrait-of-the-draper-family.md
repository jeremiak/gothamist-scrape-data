<p>Artist Kirk Demarais has created pencil portraits of your favorite fictional families, including The Whites (<em>Breaking Bad</em>), The McClanes (<em>Die Hard</em>), and the Draper family (circa Season 1 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145548/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145548/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/23/bobby_draper_leaves_mad_men.php">the original Bobby</a>). How has no one on Etsy done this yet? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145548/http://nineteeneightyeight.com/search?q=demarais">You can buy</a> a 14 x 11 inch print of the Draper portrait for just $65, or go all out for the framed original sketch which will cost you $450... but we&apos;re holding out for an updated one that includes Megan.
