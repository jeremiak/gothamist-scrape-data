<p>&quot;My favorite theater in New York to perform in has always been The Beacon. Comedians live for certain houses that just feel &#x2018;alive&#x2019; for some reason,&#x201D; Seinfeld said at the press conference, &#x201C;The Beacon is that place for me and I am so excited to make it my new home.&quot;</p>
