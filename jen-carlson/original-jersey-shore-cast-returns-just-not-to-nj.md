title: Original Jersey Shore Cast Returns... Just Not To NJ

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:257px; "> <img alt="phpFOSYIYAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114738im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpFOSYIYAM.jpg" width="257" height="350"> <br></div> At 1:33 a.m., MTV announced via a press release that the original cast of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114738/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> will be returning for a second season. Yay?<p></p>

<p>No word on how much money they&apos;re all getting, but as of a few days ago at least two cast members agreed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822114738/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/28/jersey_shore_cast_wants_more_money_1.php">to $10K</a> per episode, with the rest holding out for more. It seems once they were reminded they could easily be replaced with new guidos and guidettes, however, the negotiation process gained speed.</p>

<p>The press release noted that twelve new episodes will air this summer, and that Pauly D, Mike, Snooki, Jenni, Sammi, Ronnie and Vinny will &quot;escape the cold Northeast and find themselves in a new destination.&#x201D; Are they telling us <em>Jersey Shore</em> is returning with everything <em>but</em> the Jersey Shore? Let&apos;s just hope wherever they land, there&apos;s a duck phone awaiting them.</p>

<p>In other news, the cast has been trying out new looks... or rather, magazines have been forcing them to take it down a notch for photoshoots. Will Snooki sport her new make-under look for Season 2?</p>
