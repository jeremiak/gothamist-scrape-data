<p>So just where was artist Yoshimoto Nara tossing back a few before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151550/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/11/japanese_artist_busted_for_graffiti.php">his arrest</a> in February? Prior to getting arrested for drawing some smiley face graffiti on the L platform, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151550/http://weblogs.amny.com/entertainment/tangent/blog/2009/03/yoshimoto_nara_at_niagra.html">at Niagara bar</a> in the East Village. He adorned the place with original artwork on the walls there, too, but the owners didn&apos;t try to arrest him, instead they put it under plexiglass to preserve it.</p>
