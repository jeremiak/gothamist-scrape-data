<p>Sure, there are some common sense rules when walking on the sidewalks of New York City, but did you know <em>this</em> rule? A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520191452/http://www.parkslopeparents.com/index.php?option=com_wordpress&amp;p=4391&amp;Itemid=711">Park Slope parent</a> was recently &quot;accosted by a silver-haired woman and her cone-wearing dog&quot; for talking on her iPhone while standing on the sidewalk and leaning against a brownstone. The older woman informed her:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;You know there&#x2019;s a rule. When you stand on the left, I have to deviate from my path and walk around you. The rule is, you&#x2019;re supposed to stand on the right.&#x201D;</blockquote> 

<p>To which the Park Slope mom responded: &quot;I have lived in cities all over the world and I can tell from experience, THERE&#x2019;S NO RULE.&#x201D; (Yes, it is hard to pick a hero in this tale.) This went on for a while, and now Park Slope mom says she wakes up in the middle of the night, haunted by one question: Should we be like cars? She now sees Park Slope&apos;s sidewalks as &quot;minefields,&quot; and asks: &quot;Maybe there should be a rule of the sidewalk?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520191452/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/sidewalk-etiquette-theres-a-rule.html">FIPS</a> called 311 to ask if there were any sidewalk rules, and<em> of course there aren&apos;t</em>&#x2014;which means this woman may be haunted for the rest of her life until this sidewalk anarchy is controlled by The Law.</p>
