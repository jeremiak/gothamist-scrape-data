Her voice is often compared to that of Bj&#xF6;rk&apos;s (she has even put out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529110218/http://stereogum.com/bjork/track/4-bell-its-oh-so-quiet.html">a cover</a> of one of her songs), but she&apos;ll do plenty to pull you in on her own unique merits. Listen for yourself tonight when she takes the stage at Mercury Lounge. Oh, and listen to her mash-up of Thom Yorke&apos;s &quot;The Eraser&quot; and Radiohead&apos;s &quot;Videotape&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529110218/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/47763-bell-videotape-the-eraser-radiohead-thom-yorke-covers-live-on-fair-game-mp3">here</a>).</em></p>

<p><strong>What was the first ever pop song you remember hearing?</strong> I&apos;m not sure if this counts as a pop song, but when I was about three or four my mom and I would dance around the living room almost every morning to &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; from the Jungle Book. If that doesn&apos;t fully count, I remember pretty vividly the first moment I turned on MTV, in sixth grade. &quot;The Sweater Song&quot; was on, immediately followed by &quot;Bop Gun&quot;. So that&apos;s my story: Disney, Weezer, Ice Cube.  </p>

<p><strong>When did you start playing music?</strong> When I was five.</p>

<p><strong>What current bands are you listening to?</strong> Animal Collective, Fennesz, Clark and Erykah Badu&apos;s new records, Beyonce and Rihanna singles, a lot of Morton Feldman to balance out the noise.</p>

<p><strong>Who/what else inspires you?</strong> I try to be as omnivorous as possible, but when there&apos;s not time or money to go see and hear and taste everything, just people rushing around on the subway are pretty tantalizing. I love picking things out of the chaos---toddlers, rats, lovers, accents, strange noises, etc.    </p>

<p><strong>I hear on the side you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529110218/http://stereogum.com/archives/quit-your-day-job/quit-your-day-job-bell_048811.html">teach piano lessons</a>...do you have any interesting stories from your time doing that?</strong>  Most recently, one of the youngest kids I teach (he&apos;s about five) was playing through a song called &quot;My Dog Spike&quot; (it sounds exactly like &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;). He stopped cold in the middle of it, and looked at me, and said &quot;Ms. Bell, I like Spike better. I think you should be Ms. Spike.&quot; If I ever have a punk band it&apos;s going to be called Three Blind Spikes.</p>
