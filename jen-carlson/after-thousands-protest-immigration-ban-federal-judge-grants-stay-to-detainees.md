<p><strong>UPDATE, 9 p.m.:</strong> Federal Judge Ann M. Donnelly of the Eastern District of New York Courthouse in Brooklyn has just ordered an emergency stay against the implementation of Donald Trump&apos;s executive order. This protects those who are here with valid papers from deportation.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104233605/http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14427086/federal-court-halts-trumps-immigration-ban">The Verge</a> notes that the &quot;court ruled on a habeas corpus petition filed by the ACLU on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who were denied entry to the U.S. upon landing at JFK airport.&quot; The men have been released, and the stay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104233605/https://twitter.com/rayajalabi/status/825523863492636672">has also been extended</a> to &quot;100-200 others in airports across country.&quot; The stay will remain until hearing on Februrary 21st. Speaking outside the courthouse, Deputy director of the ACLU&#x2019;s Immigrants&#x2019; Rights Project, Lee Gelernt, declared: &quot;No one can be sent back today.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>10 p.m.</strong> The ACLU has released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104233605/https://www.aclu.org/news/federal-court-grants-stay-challenge-trump-immigration-ban">this statement</a>:</p><blockquote>A federal judge tonight granted the American Civil Liberties Union&#x2019;s request for a nationwide temporary injunction that will block the deportation of all people stranded in U.S. airports under President Trump&#x2019;s new Muslim ban. The ACLU and other legal organizations filed a lawsuit on behalf of individuals subject to President Trump&apos;s Muslim ban. The lead plaintiffs have been detained by the U.S. government and threatened with deportation even though they have valid visas to enter the United States. </blockquote>Gelernt explained: &quot;This ruling preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero, had this to say about the ruling, &#x201C;Clearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country. Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.&#x201D;</p>
