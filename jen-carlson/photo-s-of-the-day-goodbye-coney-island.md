<p>These photographs were garnered from the Brooklyn Museum&apos;s holdings to create an exhibit titled: <em>Goodbye Coney Island?</em> The collection &quot;traces the evolution of this fabled part of New York over the past 125 years,&quot; over which time it has undergone many transformations. The most prominent of which is still in the future -- with Thor Equities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309205040/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/07/city_thor_equit.php">redeveloping the area</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309205040/http://history.amusement-parks.com/parachute.htm">above ride</a> looks terrifying! If you&apos;d like to revisit the glory days, head over to the Brooklyn Museum&apos;s Visible Storage Study Center between November 28th and April 6th. The exhibit is fairly small, with just over 50 photographs. More preview shots after the jump...</p>
