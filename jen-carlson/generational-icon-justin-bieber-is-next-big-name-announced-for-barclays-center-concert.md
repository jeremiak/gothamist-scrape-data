<p>Is Jay-Z bringing all the big names to Brooklyn? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100940/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a> has been announcing some major concert headliners (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100940/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/03/leonard_cohen_to_take_his_waltz_to.php">Leonard Cohen</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100940/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/barbra_streisand_will_perform_at_ba.php">Babs</a>), with the latest being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100940/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinbieber">Justin Bieber</a>, who will be performing his first big Brooklyn concert there in November. Better watch your back, Madison Square Garden. </p>

<p>In a press release we just received, Brett Yormark (the CEO of Barclays Center) gives the following statement: <strong>&#x201C;Justin Bieber is more than a great performer, he&#x2019;s an icon for his generation. Justin&#x2019;s show at Barclays Center furthers our goal to deliver artists that reflect the diverse tastes of Brooklyn.&#x201D;</strong> Opening up for &quot;the icon&quot; is Carly Rae Jepsen, whose song will surely be stuck in all of our heads until at least Christmas. Here&apos;s Bieber and his crew lip syncing it:<br>

<p>Bieber will take the Brooklyn stage on November 12th (tickets go on sale June 2nd at 10 a.m.). For those who have remained immune to The Fever, plan on avoiding the streets and subways near the venue that day.</p>
