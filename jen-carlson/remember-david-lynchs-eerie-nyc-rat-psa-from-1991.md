<p>Happy 68th Birthday, David Lynch! In celebration, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162958/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/13/video_david_lynchs_psa_for_nycs_rat.php">let&apos;s revisit</a> the greatest PSA this city has ever been gifted: Lynch&apos;s 1991 &quot;Clean Up&quot; PSA. Lynch created this to draw attention to the city&apos;s rat problem, and worked on it with director of photography Frederick Elmes, who he also worked with on <em>Blue Velvet</em> and <em>Eraserhead</em>. With that combo, we get a classic Lynchian one-minute short, where rat claws and children with ice cream mingle with a suspenseful score and dramatically shot spilled coffee. Lynch loves a damn fine cup of coffee. And it&apos;s all shot in black &amp; white, of course...</p>

<p>He&apos;s actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162958/http://www.lynchnet.com/ads/">created plenty of ads</a> over the years... maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162958/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayordeblasio">Mayor de Blasio</a> should commission him for some new PSAs?</p>
