<p>It&apos;s been confirmed that Kanye West will be playing a free concert in Manhattan on June 9th, courtesy of Heineken. The beer company says they are &quot;giving fans in 8 select markets the chance to see a local G.O.O.D. Music performance as well as the grand prize of catching Kanye West in NYC on June 9th.&quot; There&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504040428/https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=220514034642893">unofficial Facebook page</a> tracking details for the &quot;true once in a lifetime experience,&quot; which allegedly will also include free, all-you-can-drink Heineken! Aside form that, details are scarce, just a date, a borough, and lots of speculation.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504040428/http://myfreeconcert.blogspot.com/2011/05/another-hunch-in-regards-to-kanye.html">My Free Concert</a>, it looks like Wiz Khalifa &amp; Pusha T will be opening for him. They also try to narrow down the venue, saying it could be &quot;in the warehouse where Nas /Cee-Lo went down, so Pier 36, 299 South Street on the Lower East Side, or where Cold War Kids / MTV Skins parties happened at 330 West Street.&quot; Or, you know, anywhere else in Manhattan.</p>

<p>We&apos;ll update as more information becomes available, and we highly recommend checking the show out&#x2014;his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504040428/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/kanye_west_garden_party.php">recent MoMA performance</a> was highly enjoyable, and we&apos;re not just saying that because of all the free wine.</p>
