<p>The ad, which ran in Sunday&apos;s Daily News, stressed that the driver must be discreet, &quot;a prerequisite ever since a former driver claimed Markowitz stashed wine in his black SUV and used emergency sirens to bypass traffic, among other abuses.&quot; The ad reads:</p><blockquote>The office of the Brooklyn borough president is seeking an experienced Chauffeur/Attendant who can maintain confidentiality at all times and drive the Borough President to various meetings and events.</blockquote>Are you willing to turn a blind eye to how Marty uses the publicly funded service? Former driver Mario Nicholas warns, &quot;He&apos;s a very difficult boss to drive for.&quot;<p></p>
