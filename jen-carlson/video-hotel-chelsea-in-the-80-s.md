										<p>As the Hotel Chelsea keeps going through some corporate changes, it&apos;s nice to look back at the glory days of the legendary hotel. In 1981 the BBC folk released a documentary about the place, capturing some of the quirky residents, employees, and of course general manager (at the time) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190231/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/17/a_conversation.php">Stanley Bard</a> behind his desk. Luckily some of the footage just popped up online.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190231/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/28/hotel_chelsea_o.php">a clip of Warhol</a> in the documentary found its way to YouTube (it has since disappeared). Now if only there were footage from Mark Twain&apos;s stay there.
