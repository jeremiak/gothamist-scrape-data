</div></div>					<p>Travel back to New York City in 1974&#x2014;these photos are all courtesy of the U.S. National Archives, and focus on what they deem &quot;Inner City life&quot; in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Brooklyn photos all include this text in their original captions: &quot;Brooklyn remains one of America&apos;s best surviving examples of a 19th century city. Some of the best architecture survives in her &apos;worst&apos; neighborhoods that haven&apos;t been demolished.&quot; How do you think that sentence would be written in 2011?</p>
