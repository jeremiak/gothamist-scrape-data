However, the manufacturer for the foldable benches, Kawasaki, &quot;balked, calling the four-car order too small. So now the seats are to be retrofitted into newly delivered subway cars&#x2014;once they arrive&#x2014;on MTA facilities.&quot; For now, chalk it up to another stalled MTA project.<p></p>
