<p>SNL has announced the first batch of hosts for their upcoming 41st season, and while two were expected, the third is a pretty great surprise: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101512/http://gothamist.com/tags/tracymorgan">Tracy Morgan</a> will host the October 17th episode. The SNL alum has slowly been recovering from a car crash last year that left him in critical condition. This won&apos;t be his first appearance on TV since the crash&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151118101512/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/tracy_morgan_today_show.php">he appeared on The Today Show in June</a>&#x2014;but will likely be his first time getting back to doing comedy.</p>

<p>Prior to his appearance, Miley Cyrus will kick things off on October 3rd, followed by Amy Schumer on October 10th. SNL announced the lineup on Twitter, and haven&apos;t yet named any musical guests.</p>
