<p>Don&apos;t tourists know about flash mobs yet? They have basically become a corporate tool for pushing products, and were even featured in that adorable Justin Timberlake-Mila Kunis rom com <em>Friends With Benefits</em>... twice! Tourists totally saw that movie. And also all of the commercials that feature flash mobs. But yet, some still seemed confused when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822192213/http://gothamist.com/tags/improveverywhere">Improv Everywhere</a> pulled their latest stunt at South Street Seaport. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822192213/http://improveverywhere.com/2013/07/22/the-mp3-experiment-ten/">They explain</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;For our latest mission, over 7,000 people pressed play simultaneously and listened to an mp3 file filled with ridiculous instructions at Manhattan&#x2019;s South Street Seaport. Participants were instructed to dress as tourists to blend in with the crowd and surprise real tourists with their unexpected synchronized actions.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Watch below, and be very happy you weren&apos;t at South Street Seaport when <em>7,000</em> extra people showed up one day.</p>
