										<p>Daredevil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702195645/http://gothamist.com/tags/jebcorliss">Jeb Corliss</a>, who once attempted to base jump off of the Empire State Building, has now posted a video from his latest stunt, which landed him in the hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702195645/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/empire_state_building_jumper_jeb_co.php">In January</a>, the 35-year-old was in intensive care after a failed leap off of a 3,500-foot mountain in South Africa. Corliss smashed into the side of Table Mountain while HBO film crews were documenting him, and now he&apos;s released his helmet-cam footage&#x2014;he warns it may be disturbing to some:</p>

It was awesom. It&apos;s amazing how weak you get laying in bed for 5 weeks.&quot; And in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702195645/http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/injured-jumper-jeb-corliss-vows-keep-flying-144004768--abc-news.html">a recent interview</a> he talked about getting back to his life, saying, &quot;The only reason I&apos;m getting better is so that I can jump again. That&apos;s what I do.  There&apos;s absolutely nothing in this world that&apos;s going to stop me from jumping.&quot;</p>
