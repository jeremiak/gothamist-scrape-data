<p>The Birthplace of Hip Hop, 1520 Sedgwick, was recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510194233/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/04/new_owner_for_birthplace_of_hiphop.php">sold to a new owner</a> (a developer), leaving its future more questionable than ever. Luckily, folks are preserving the history of the area in any way they can, most recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510194233/http://bronxrhymes.com/">Bronx Rhymes</a> launched, which is a multi-media installation by digital artists Claudia Bernett and Maria Ioveva that &quot;celebrates Hip Hop&apos;s innovative artistry, inspirational impact and community contributions. It highlights now legendary locations and milestones through a guerilla graphics campaign in the borough where it all began.&quot; </p>

<p><em>You</em> are even invited to help the project evolve. So far a series of Bronx Rhymes posters have been installed at iconic Hip Hop landmarks throughout the South Bronx, with each describing the historical significance of that location &quot;in the form of a rhyme, and invites passersby to text their own rhymes in response&quot; (submission will show up on their website). Check out the interactive map <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120510194233/http://transition.turbulence.org/Works/bronx_rhymes/map.html?id=2">here</a> for an idea of what&apos;s out there.</p>
