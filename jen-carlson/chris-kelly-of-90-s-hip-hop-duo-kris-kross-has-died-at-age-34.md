<p>Kris Kross&apos;s Chris &quot;Mac Daddy&quot; Kelly was pronounced dead at the Atlanta Medical Center in Georgia at 5 p.m. on Wednesday evening. There are very few details, but the 34-year-old Kelly was found unresponsive in his home. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040125/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/05/01/chris-kelly-kriss-kross-dies/2128291/">USA Today</a>, Investigator Betty Honey of the Fulton County Medical Examiner&apos;s office &quot;said authorities are unsure of Kelly&apos;s cause of death and that an autopsy has yet to be performed.&quot; One is scheduled for Thursday.</p>

<p>Kelly was 1/2 of the 1990s hip-hop duo, whose gimmick was wearing their clothes backwards. This year they reunited at a 20th anniversary party for Jermaine Dupri&apos;s So So Def label (video below). Durpi discovered the duo in a mall in Atlanta in 1990.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to a report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040125/http://www.tmz.com/2013/05/02/chris-kelly-death-police-report-cocaine-and-heroin-suspected/">obtained by TMZ</a>, &quot;Kelly had been using a combination of cocaine and heroin the night before his death... cops responded to Kelly&apos;s home Wednesday afternoon and found the 34-year-old lying on the living room couch.&quot; Paramedics attempted to revive Kelly, to no avail. A friend of Kelly&apos;s told police that he &quot;had felt nauseous all morning before passing out.&quot;</p>
