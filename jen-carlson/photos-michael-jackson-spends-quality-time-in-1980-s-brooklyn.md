Below you can watch the full short film, which follows Jackson&apos;s character&#x2014;Daryl, a private school student&#x2014;as he returns home and attempts to prove his <em>badness</em>.</p>

<p>Following Jackson&apos;s death in 2009, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316202615/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/the_hoyt-schermerhorn-michael_jacks.php">a brief lobbying effort</a> to get the station&apos;s name changed, or at least a plaque put up in honor of the performer. At the time, City Councilwoman Letitia James stated: &quot;Having Michael Jackson visit and moonwalk at this station was a huge deal not only for Brooklyn, but all of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316202615/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/amazing_photos_of_1980s_new_york_ci.php#photo-1">New York in the &apos;80s</a>.&quot; The proposal was ultimately denied by the MTA.</p>
