</div></div>					<p>A couple of months ago we were tipped off by our friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509072950/http://theglorifiedtomato.com/2013/05/14/rockaways-first-wine-bar-sayras/">The Glorified Tomato</a> about a new wine bar opening in Rockaway called Sayra&apos;s, complete with an outdoor space with picnic tables and a projection screen for movies. This is the first, and currently only, wine bar in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509072950/http://www.suckapants.com/">Tod Seelie</a> checked the place out for us this week, delivering these photos of a gorgeous space designed and built by co-owner Patrick Filbotte. &quot;In addition to designing and building the interior, he also welded and built all the bar chairs,&quot; Seelie says. &quot;He financed the bar with a large sculpture commission, and displays his friend&apos;s art in the bar.&quot;</p>

<p>Filbotte&apos;s partner in crime is Rashida Jackson, a Rockaway native who he met while bartending in Fort Greene. The duo signed the lease about two months before Hurricane Sandy hit, and they started construction shortly after the storm.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509072950/https://twitter.com/SayrasWineBar">Sayra&apos;s</a> is now open for business, and offers a menu of small plates, wine (starting at $6/glass and $24/bottle), and beer.</p>

<p><strong>TAPAS MENU</strong><br>
Patatas frita, $2<br>
smoked paprika &amp; rosemary chips</p>

<p>Marinated olives, $3<br>
house mixed olives with lemon zest, crushed red pepper flakes and sea salt</p>

<p>Cheese plate, $11<br>
chevre, blue, sheep and brie cheese served with sourdough toast &amp; orange marmalade</p>

<p>BBQ pulled pork sandwiches, $9<br>
on silver dollar brioche</p>

<p>Pepper turkey sandwich, $7<br>
cranberry dressing, bried cheese and arugula on silver dollar brioche, served with chips. </p>

<p>Spicy homemade meatball, $7<br>
in a tomato sauce served with sourdough toast</p>

<p>Peanut butter costini, $4<br>
two slices</p>

<p>Pesto costini, $4<br>
two slices</p>
