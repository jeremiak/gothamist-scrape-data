We bought them second hand.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The seats are in Theater 4 and 5, and the rep told FIPS, &quot;You are welcome to come by and check them out.&quot; We called Cobble Hill Cinemas and manager Janette Pagan confirms that &quot;We do have seats from the Pavilion&quot; but insists &quot;they&apos;re not the purple seats everyone is talking about. The seats we have from the Pavilion are regular burgundy-red seats.&quot; Pagan also told us there had been no reports of bed bugs whatsoever at her theater. (Even better, there were still <em>Dark Knight Rises</em> midnight screening tickets left for Friday morning. Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111154/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/05/pavilion_theater_bed_bugs_inspire_n.php">bring your seat cover</a>!)</p>
