<p>This weekend the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027024047/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/28/magazine/one-page-magazine.html?ref=magazine">New York Times</a> released their Meh List, which included six things that are &quot;meh&quot; according to one Samantha Henig. The list has a few twists, like how the word &quot;meh&quot; isn&apos;t on the list itself, and also the SHOCKING finale:</p>

<p>1. Harrison Ford&#x2019;s earring*<br>
2. Golden ages<br>
3. &#x201C;Epic&#x201D;<br>
4. One mimosa <br>
5. Rimless eyeglasses<br>
6. Ramps (the vegetable)<br>
 <br>
There are two things that could have happened here. Either the Grey Lady is trolling us, or someone made a really embarrassing error. In case it&apos;s the latter, we&apos;ve taken a few moments to draft up a correction, that should go up as soon as possible: &quot;An earlier version of The Meh List misspelled &apos;Fiddlehead Ferns&apos; as &apos;Ramps.&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027024047/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">Ramps still amazing</a>. We regret the error.&quot; Yeah, that&apos;s right, FIDDLEHEAD FERNS ARE TERRIBLE.</p>
