<p>What&apos;s the hold up with this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131516/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> resignation press conference? We have some ideas: </p>

<ul><li>Andrew Breitbart is still getting his makeup done.
</li><li>They&apos;re getting the camera angles just right.
</li><li>Weiner is clearing his cache.
</li><li>Or maybe he&apos;s charging his cell phone.
</li><li>Getting motivated to throw your entire political future into the toilet can take some time.</li></ul>
