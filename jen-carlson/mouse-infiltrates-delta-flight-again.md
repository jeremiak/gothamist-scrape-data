title: Mouse Infiltrates Delta Flight... Again!

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mickeypilot1109.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140036im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mickeypilot1109.jpg" width="222" height="173" class="image-left"> </span>One more incident like this and Delta is going to get a reputation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140036/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/mouse_attack_at_jfk.php">Just weeks after</a> a mouse was found on board one of their planes, causing an evacuation and serious delay... it&apos;s happened again!</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140036/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/mouse-grounds-plane-at-kennedy/">the NY Times</a>, last night a Delta flight at JFK, bound for London&apos;s Heathrow Airport, was delayed and passengers moved to another aircraft when a mouse was spotted on board. &quot;The 147 passengers had waited for about half an hour for Flight 001 to leave the gate when a crew member announced that the mouse sighting meant the plane would have to be cleared.&quot;</p>

<p>The officials told passengers that if a mouse were indeed on board, it could chew through electrical wires and hydraulic lines. Ergo, all that is standing between you and certain death while flying is a tiny, little mouse.</p>
