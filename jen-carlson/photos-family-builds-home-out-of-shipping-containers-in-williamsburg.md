</div></div>					<p>A family has gone Full Brooklyn and is building a 3-story home made of 21 stacked shipping containers in Williamsburg. Yes, this has been done before, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423215203/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/finally_someone_in_williamsburg_is.php">David Boyle and Michele Bertomen&apos;s cute container home</a> was more representative of the early aughts Williamsburg: artsy, DIY, not really that much to look at. This new family is bringing in some Luxury design, to fit in with the shiny <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423215203/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/04/photos_williamsburgs_future_comes_w.php">new soulless Williamsburg</a>.</p>

<p>The 5,000-square-foot home&#x2014;made of stacked and diagonally cut containers&#x2014;will &quot;invoke Williamsburg&apos;s industrial past, while providing a sculptural nod to the rapidly changing neighborhood,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423215203/http://www.lot-ek.com/filter/residential/CARROLL-HOUSE">LOT-EK</a>. The firm also explains that &quot;container assembly is studied to reduce waste, recombining and reusing all leftovers generated by the diagonal cut.&quot;</p>

<p>The home will have a garage, a yard, a media room with tiered seating, a BBQ pit, the fireplace of your dreams, beautiful sunsets every night, and a goddamn lap pool. And according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423215203/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2013/12/02/angular_shipping_container_house_gets_stacked_in_the_burg.php">Curbed</a>, it&apos;s under construction now.</p>
