<p>This week photographer and one of the key holders to our Gothamist Instagram account, Sam Horine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://instagram.com/p/VwwGLvLEA0/">uploaded this photo</a>, asking: &quot;Did you know there&apos;s a section of the Berlin wall in Midtown?&quot;</p>

<p>There are a number of segments of the wall located in the city&#x2014;between Gateway Plaza and the North Cove marina in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://www.flickr.com/photos/afulki/286723731/">World Financial Cente</a>r; in the gardens at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/sgsm8185.html">United Nations headquarters</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://www.flickr.com/photos/checco/323282714/">at the Intrepid</a>; and this one at 53rd Street between 5th and Madison Avenues.</p>

<p>But how are the 12-foot-high, 5,000-pound pieces of history in Midtown received? Everyone&apos;s a critic, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://www.yelp.com/biz/berlin-wall-the-piece-of-new-york">the Yelpers have spoken out</a>, giving them a meager 2.5 stars. One reviewer writes, &quot;Probably not worth a special trip except for Wall completists.&quot; For comparison, the Statue of Liberty has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://www.yelp.com/biz/statue-of-liberty-national-monument-new-york">4.5 stars</a> and Momofuku Ssam has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-3">4 stars</a>. Then again, the wall is still better than being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123116/http://www.yelp.com/biz/manhattan-central-booking-new-york">taken to the Tombs.</a> </p>
