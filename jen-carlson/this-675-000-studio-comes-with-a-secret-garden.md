</div></div>					<p>There is this hashtag that I believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092902/https://www.instagram.com/jensnow/">Jen Snow</a> came up with on Instagram: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092902/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sometimesnewyorkcitylookslikethis/">#sometimesnewyorkcitylookslikethis</a>, and that is exactly what I thought of when I saw this: </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpayEg4zAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092902im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpayEg4zAM.jpg" width="640" height="456" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>A little sidewalk door marked 340a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092902/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/6/7/11878180/west-village-micro-apartment-for-sale">on West 11th Street</a> is a portal to a magical world that <em>you</em> can be a citizen of... if you have $675,000. That&apos;s how much a studio apartment is going for in the 19th Century &quot;back house&quot; at the address. It&apos;s damn charming, and will transport you to a more bucolic, old world Manhattan. Sometimes New York City looks like that.</p>

<p>The West Village apartment features a wood-burning fireplace, a little alcove for you to dream sweetly in, pure bliss, other things you&apos;d expect in an apartment, like a stove, a bluebird that comes to your window every morning, and a courtyard. A private courtyard, but presumably you&apos;ll need to share it with 41 other units <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092902/http://streeteasy.com/complex/340-west-11-street">in the complex</a>. Bonus: no upstairs neighbors, as this slice of heaven is on the top floor.
