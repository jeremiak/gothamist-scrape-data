<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="rickshawwww1011.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134015im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/rickshawwww1011.jpg" width="640" height="401" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134015/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAlinvw2Rb0&amp;feature=related">so J. Peterman catalog</a>. Anthropologie (either you, your girlfriend, or your sister loves this store) has ventured into some odd territory with their latest offering: a rickshaw (what will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134015/http://www.anthroparodie.com/">Anthroparodie</a> say?). Though they should be calling it a ricksh<em>awwww</em> because it&apos;s so freakin&apos; adorable. After a trip to India, the company designed their own, adding &quot;special touches&quot; like a collapsible kantha-fabric canopy, handlebar streamers, &quot;a bell for brrring-bringing on the bike path,&quot; and a headlight that illuminates when the pedals are cranked.</p>

<p>The description says it&apos;s &quot;an instant conversation starter on the road&quot;&#x2014;which, if you&apos;re taking it into the bike lane like they recommend, it certainly is. And that kind of attention will only cost you $2,200 (plus $300 shipping).
