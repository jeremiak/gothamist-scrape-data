But we figure it&apos;s about damn time we revisit this rap trio&apos;s catalog.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn group was comprised of Prince Markie Dee, Kool Rock-Ski, and Big Buff Love&#x2014;a pioneer of beatboxing who died of a heart attack at age 28. They were early ambassadors of hip-hop; were embedded in &apos;80s pop culture&#x2014;featured in one of the earliest commercials to air on MTV (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010036/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXuZ32qXxbQ">for Swatch</a>) and bringing Freddy Krueger into one of their videos; they recorded with both The Beach Boys <em>and</em> Chubby Checker; starred in the feature film <em>Disorderlies</em>; and garnered much respect from their peers (more recently, Jay-Z&apos;s even mentioned them in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010036/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QePjIIBI-sI">a song</a>).</p>

<p>Below, check out some of their interviews and videos... the first one features a Sbarro off the 49th Street stop:</p>

<p>And here they are in 1985&apos;s <em>Krush Groove</em>, a film based on &quot;the early days of Def Jam Recordings and up-and-coming record producer Russell Simmons (renamed Russell Walker in the film).&quot;</p>
