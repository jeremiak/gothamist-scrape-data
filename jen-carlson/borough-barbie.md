<p>&quot;This doll is made of actual tofu. She has long straight brown hair, arch-less feet, hairy armpits, no makeup and Birkenstocks with white socks. She prefers that you call her Willow. She does not want or need a Ken doll, but if you purchase two Park Slope Barbies and the optional Subaru wagon, you get a rainbow flag bumper sticker for free.&quot;</p>

What about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723022143/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/11/19/indie_kids.php">the kindie rockers</a>? Keep up with the times if you&apos;re going to spend all that time making poorly crafted photoshop images.
