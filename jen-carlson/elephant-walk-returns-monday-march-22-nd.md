<p>The circus is coming to town, and with it comes the elephants. The annual Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624094429/http://gothamist.com/tags/elephantwalk">Elephant Walk</a> is this coming Monday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624094429/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/03/save_the_date_elephant_walk.php">March 22nd</a>, from 11:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. The elephants, and some of their human coworkers, will walk through the Queens Midtown Tunnel to Madison Square Garden. What to expect: six Asian elephants, eight ponies, three stilt walkers, a watusi, and animal trainers. And of course: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624094429/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/14/prior_to_elephant_walk_peta_takes_o.php">protesters</a>.</p>

<p>To view the procession, they suggest you wait on the Manhattan-side of the tunnel at East 37th Street between Second and Third Avenues, the circus group will emerge around midnight, at which point they will &#x201C;pose&#x201D; for photographs. If you get some good shots, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624094429/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">email us</a> (or tag them &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr)!</p>

<p>Drivers, please note, while there will be two-way vehicular traffic (one lane in either direction) in the south tube (normally Queens-bound) during this period, you may want to use an alternate route to avoid delays. The north tube of the tunnel is expected to re-open around 2 a.m. on the 23rd.</p>

<p>If you want to catch the big show, it&apos;ll be at MSG from March 25th through April 4th. And this summer Ringling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624094429/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/ringling.php">is back at Coney Island</a> with their new &quot;Illuscination&quot; show.</p>
