While their average life spans aren&apos;t known, Bertha was believed to have been the longest living sand tiger shark in <em>any</em> aquarium.</p>

<p>Though just announced today, Bertha actually died on Saturday when she was euthanized. Marine biologist at the Coney Island aquarium, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306202415/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/bertha-new-york-aquariums-oldest-shark-is-dead/">Hans Walters, said</a> &#x201C;It was a rough decision to have to lose this animal,&#x201D; whose health had been declining over the last month despite treatments. </p>

<p>Necropsy results for the over 7-ft long and 250-lb shark, which will determine the health problems, are not yet in. Currently there are 8 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306202415/http://www.flickr.com/photos/idontlikeribena/358705149">other sharks</a> living in the 90,000-gallon tank. </p>
