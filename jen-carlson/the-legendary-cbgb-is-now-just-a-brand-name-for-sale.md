At the time, the estate already said they were trying to find potential buyers, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112450/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-08/at-t-sony-atv-watson-pharmaceuticals-apple-cbgb-intellectual-property.html">Bloomberg News</a> reports that they&apos;ll be auctioning it off. <p></p>

<p>The brand will be sold via Streambank LLC, who were hired by the estate; they say, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re expecting it to trade well in excess of a couple million. The brand still resonates worldwide and could be used for new opportunities in live clubs, apparel and interactive media.&quot; </p>

<p>So where <em>will</em> we be seeing the &quot;CBGB OMFUG&quot; name in the future? Half of the punk generation is currently cringing in their graves at the possibilities. <em>Shhh</em>, sleep now, listen to some Blondie:</p>
