                            <p>There&apos;s much controversy over the future of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140108015725/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">carriage horse industry</a> &#x2014; and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140108015725/http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2010/01/03/central-park-in-a-horse-drawn-sleigh/">Ephemeral NY</a> takes a look back to when there were horse drawn <em>sleighs</em> all over a snowy Central Park. It certainly romanticizes what many believe to be a cruel industry. And check out this December 1898 video showing just how popular those horse-drawn sleighs were! Back in February of 1876, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140108015725/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9401E0D9113FE73BBC4E53DFB466838D669FDE">the NY Times</a> reported over 10,000 sleighs passing through the park in one day.</p>

The tradition was carried on with the Central Park Casino until it&#x2019;s demise in 1934.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140108015725/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E2DD1339E433A25755C0A9649D946196D6CF">The NY Times</a> reported on the tradition back in 1910, saying that year the snow wasn&apos;t heavy enough for &quot;good sleighing.&quot;</p>
