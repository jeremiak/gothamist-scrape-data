<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180145/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/arts/music/10boyk.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reflects on Bright Eyes&apos; recent seven night run at Town Hall. Is Conor Oberst so complex that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180145/http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/06/10/arts/10kuo-graphic.html">many, many charts</a> analyzing him, his show and his fans outbursts, is necessary?

</p><p>Maybe not, but in an effort to explain &quot;art&quot; with a little bit of &quot;science&quot; the Times actually sent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180145/http://earlboykins.blogspot.com/">a blogger</a> to all seven shows - to test his endurance, and bring home the cold hard facts. </p>

<p>The observations range from the light-hearted and elementary &quot;there are drunk weirdos everywhere!&quot; and &quot;is he drunk?&quot; to a more advanced chart on the &quot;special guests (of note)&quot; so confusing that we can&apos;t tell if Norah Jones was well received or not. (And do big ZZZ&apos;s mean something was more boring than little zzz&apos;s?!) Overall, however, it&apos;s an interesting take on  show reviewing, and blogger/statistician Andrew Kuo seemed to enjoy the run, telling the Times &#x201C;I&#x2019;m listening to Bright Eyes more than ever now. I know it&#x2019;s crazy.&#x201D;</p>
