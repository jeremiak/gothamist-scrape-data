One man recently heard voices... like, those typically garbled announcements, yet allegedly <em>crystal clear</em>. Upon wondering about the humans behind the familiar voices, he fell down a rabbit hole online and came out with a pretty thorough article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://whosevoice.org/home/2010/1/4/guided-by-subterranean-voices.html">on the subterranean sounds</a>.<p></p>

<p>First off, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/06/subway_announcers_wanted.php">last year</a> some new voices were being sought out &#x2014;&#xA0;at the time, 33 announcers covered 15 posts throughout the system, and 14 were soon to be hired. The curious author covers about 4 of the voices &#x2014; Charlie Pellett, Jessica Ettinger Gottesman, Dianne Thompson and Catherine Cowdery &#x2014;&#xA0;noting, &quot;as the story goes, in 1999, Bloomberg Radio donated the time of some of its employees to the MTA as a public service. This group recorded various announcements for alerts that would ultimately become the sound of the underground for millions of New Yorkers.&quot;</p>

<p>And an interesting fact: most of the <em>orders</em> are given by a male voice, while <em>informational</em> messages are from females. Which do you prefer? We think the city should get celebrity voices down there &#x2014;&#xA0;if drivers can get Sean Connery to be the voice of their GPS, straphangers should too! Or <em>at least</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/06/video_no_service_according_to_crazy.php">this lady</a>.</p>
