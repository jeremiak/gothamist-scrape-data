<p>The West 4th Street newsstand was recently removed, and check out what it revealed: this old MTA sign. Eagle-eyed photographer Kathryn Yu spotted it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030235/http://twitter.com/#!/kathrynyu/status/117018472994717697">last night</a>. The sign reads: 8th Avenue Independent Subway Station, which opened in 1932 as the first line of the Independent Subway System. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the MTA to see if they&apos;d consider leaving the ol&apos; gal up&#x2014;after all, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030235/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/21/subway_mosaic.php#photo-1">the tiled mosaic</a> was unearthed at the 59th Street-Columbus Circle station they told us they were &quot;well aware of the historical significance... and we are working on a design for a window in the wall so this treasure can be shared with the public at some future date.&#x201D;</p>
