<p>Earlier this year, just as we were beginning to embrace <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123708/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/nycs_most_unrealistic_television_ap.php#photo-1">its totally unrealistic NYC apartments</a>, <em>Don&apos;t Trust The B&#x2014; In Apt 23</em> was cancelled.  The show had a small hardcore following, even if it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123708/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/dont_trust_the_b_in_apartment_23.php">wasn&apos;t loved by all</a>... and for those who loved The B, they&apos;ll be happy to hear that there are eight new episodes coming soon. The remaining eight&#x2014;or as <em>one of the best parts of the show</em> James Van Der Beek calls them &quot;lost&quot;&#x2014;episodes will air on ABC.com, Hulu and iTunes starting May 17th.</p>

<p>Now where are we on that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123708/http://gothamist.com/tags/dawsonscreek"><em>Dawson&apos;s Creek</em></a> movie? Certainly Netflix or Kickstarter or the magic will of our inner-twenty-something can make this happen.</p>
