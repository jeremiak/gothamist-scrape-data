Over the summer, Wiita was photographing a subway station entrance and its surroundings at 207th Street and 10th Avenue as part of an ambitious 10-day photography project. He was detained by police, handcuffed and held for 30 minutes; now Wiita is &quot;seeking compensatory damages and reimbursement of legal fees.&quot; He believes that his South Asian or Middle Eastern appearance made him a target.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151217022212/http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/NYPD_sued_for_arrest_of_student_photographer/11021.html">Metro</a>, &quot;police sources said officers question people photographing the city&#x2019;s rail infrastructure on rare occasions, citing instances in which law enforcement officials have identified men taking photographs of city bridges and subways as Iranian intelligence agents and suspected Pakistani terrorists who were stopped by police while taking pictures of the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges.&quot; We asked Wiita a few questions about the incident as well as his photography project (which sounds pretty amazing; he sent us the above shot which was taken just before he was handled by the long arm of the law).</p>

<p><strong>Can you describe the photography project you were working on? </strong><br>
The project was designed as a way to document how the subway is an integral part of the fabric of life in the city.  I love how it is the grand unifier across race, class, and geography in the city.  I wanted to photograph both the inside of every subway station (predominantly decorative aspects, such as artwork and signage) as well as the immediate surroundings of each station in order to document the people, architecture, and general feel of the area. After the arrest, I greatly cut down on taking any photos inside of subway stations out of fear of further hassling by the cops. </p>
