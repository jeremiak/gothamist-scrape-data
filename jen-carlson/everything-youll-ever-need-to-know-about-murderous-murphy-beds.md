<p>The Murphy Bed was invented around 1900, and it has continued to fascinate since. Really! Not only is it comedic...</p>

<p>... but it&apos;s functional, and a bit of a miracle for anyone living in a small space. Plus, it&apos;s like you have a secret chamber in your house, which is cool and sort of James Bond-ish. So let&apos;s get intimate with the Murphy Bed with some fun (and gruesome) facts:</p>

<ul><li>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/aroundthemall/2009/04/curator-finds-murphy-beds-place-in-american-history/#ixzz2RxmYda53">Smithsonian Mag</a>, the Murphy Bed was originally invented around 1900 in San Francisco, when William Lawrence Murphy &quot;was falling for a young opera singer and courting customs at that time would not permit a lady to enter a gentleman&#x2019;s bedroom. His invention allowed him to stow his bed in his closet, transforming his one-room apartment from a bedroom into a parlor.&quot;
</li><li>Murphy then formed the Murphy Bed Company, and patented his &quot;In-A-Door&quot; bed in 1908. He never trademarked the name &quot;Murphy Bed,&quot; however.
</li><li>Murphy Beds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://www.murphybedcompany.com/home.php">peaked in 1925</a>, when the company moved its corporate headquarters to New York City. 
</li><li>Bed historian Robyn Einhorn of the Smithsonian in Washington <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-6553853.html">says</a> owning a Murphy Bed became a status symbol&#x2014;&quot;People would move into these hotels in New York and they would have a suite which would include a Murphy bed, so they could pick up the bed and have a parlor.&quot;
</li><li>The grandson of inventor William, Clark W. Murphy, has been the president of the company since 1983.
</li><li>Sometimes there are closets under them:</li></ul>

<ul><li>Murphy Beds have killed before, and they&apos;ll probably kill again. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tyne/4130466.stm">In 2005</a>, two women were entrapped and suffocated by a collapsing Murphy bed. In 1982, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19820615&amp;id=_UdOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XBMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5293,3260935">a man died</a> from suffocating inside a Murphy bed. 
</li><li>But perhaps the most horrifying Murphy Bed story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft658007dm&amp;chunk.id=d0e1580&amp;toc.id=d0e1441&amp;brand=ucpress">comes from Liverpool</a>, where &quot;a woman&apos;s final trip to her old family home turned into a horrifying nightmare when she discovered her grandmother&apos;s mummified corpse stuffed into a folding bed&#x2014;still wearing her favorite nightgown. Abigail Larson, 72, died when her fold-away bed&#x2014;commonly known as a Murphy bed&#x2014;lurched backward into its cabinet as she slept, pinning the gray-haired granny between the mattress and the wall.&quot;
</li><li>Oddly, there are no B horror movies in which the Murphy Bed is the villain. C&apos;mon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharktopus">Syfy network</a>.
</li><li>The beds have showed up in Hollywood productions, however. Not only in the above Charlie Chaplin flick, but in <em>Police Academy II</em>, <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</em>, <em>Laverne &amp; Shirley</em>, and <em>Family Guy</em>.
</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://www.tudorcity.com/Windsor.html">Windsor Tower</a>, a 1929 hotel turned apartment building, still has Murphy Beds in their studios (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbvvM0myfM">see them in this video</a>).
</li><li>And finally, the oddest Murphy Bed lives in New York... there is a Piano Bed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430030519/http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/1808">at the Brooklyn Museum</a>!</li></ul>
