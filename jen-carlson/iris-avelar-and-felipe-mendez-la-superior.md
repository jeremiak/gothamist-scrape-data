										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lasuperiorfelipeiris.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102005im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lasuperiorfelipeiris.jpg" width="325" height="314" class="image-left"> </span><em>This month marks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102005/http://www.lasuperiornyc.com/">La Superior</a>&apos;s first full year in business, after opening up in Williamsburg much to the delight of taco-loving locals. Their authentic Mexican street and market fare has tantalized the tastebuds of everyone who has stopped by the taqueria (the first real one in Williamsburg, for those keeping track). This year they&apos;ve got a new mural up, and hopefully by next year they&apos;ll have their outdoor seating available.</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Co-owners Iris Avelar and Felipe Mendez recently told us a little bit about their joint, the prospect of a liquor license, and chatting with James Brown in a hotel room.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did the idea for La Superior come about? Iris:</strong> People often think the name has a Los Angeles reference or that it means &#x201C;the superior&#x201D; taqueria, but the intention is a play on the Mexican vintage beer, Superior. We believed La Superior made sense since we wanted to recreate the experience of a neighborhood cantina in Mexico.</p>

<p><strong>Felipe:</strong> The idea of La Superior came out from seeing a big gap between fancy &quot;mexican&quot; restaurants and really bad ones in NYC, and even worse, no taquerias at all. The name of La Superior came out from a joke/game that is very common in Mexico that the traditional taquerias and cantinas are called La Poderosa (the powerful) La Unica (the unique one) La Especial (the special one) and so on... and also there&apos;s a famous beer brand that was really popular in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s that disappeared from the market in the late 80&apos;s, called La Superior.</p>
