<p>Word on the street is that the beloved and sacred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141123/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">RAMPS</a> have finally started arriving at the city&apos;s greenmarkets. It&apos;s weird that this isn&apos;t some national holiday, but if you can squeeze out of work we recommend rushing to Union Square [update: we just ran over to the greenmarket and there are no ramps!], pushing anyone who gets in your way, and grabbing a handful so you can churn out some ramp pesto tonight. (They&apos;ve also been spotted, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141123/http://instagram.com/p/X2mZ9iwSCO/">along with Meg Ryan</a>, at Dean &amp; Deluca in SoHo.) Pesto recipes are really pretty cut and dry, but the atomic garlic power held within the ramp makes them a little more difficult to work with&#x2014;after experimenting on perfecting the recipe for years, I feel this recipe and the accompanying tips will lead you to ramp pesto bliss:</p>

<p><strong>RAMP PESTO</strong></p><ul><li>1 bunch of ramps (washed, and with the roots cut off)<br>
</li><li>1/4 to 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese (this is important: use the powder-like, grated kind... not the fresh, shredded kind)<br>
</li><li>1 cup of roasted pistachios (you can go raw if you want to, it won&apos;t make a huge difference, but I prefer roasting them for about 8 minutes)<br>
</li><li>2 tbsp olive oil<br>
</li><li>A few squeezes of lemon (if you&apos;re really into lemon, I&apos;d recommended using a Meyer lemon and tossing some zest in as well)</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Put everything in the food processor&#x2014;all at once is totally fine! It&apos;s such beautiful chaos&#x2014;and test it. Is it too powerful that your tongue feels like it&apos;s burning? Then add more grated parm and a little more olive oil to cut it.</p>

<p>Note: Some people also add parsley or basil but those people are eating sub-par ramp pesto as a result.<em> [Editor&apos;s Note: Seriously, Carlson&apos;s pesto kicks freakin&apos; asssssssss.]</em></p>
