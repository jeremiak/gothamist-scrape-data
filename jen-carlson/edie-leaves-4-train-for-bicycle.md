<p>It&apos;s been over a month since we saw Edie the hamster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151822/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/01/hamster_rides_the_4_train.php">riding the 4 train</a>, and now she&apos;s back with a new mode of transportation: a bicycle! That&apos;s right, Edie has gone hipster with a colorful two-wheeler (though it doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s fixed gear). Here she is pumping up the tire outside of the bike shop... maybe you&apos;ll see her at the next Critical Mass!</p>
