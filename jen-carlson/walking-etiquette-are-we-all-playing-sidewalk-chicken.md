<p>A new New Yorker, recently relocated from a small Texas town, is wondering about the walking habits of locals. This person posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090708/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/scdh0/walking_etiquette/">on Reddit</a>, asking, &quot;I seem to have these instances... there will be 2-3 people walking side by side, taking up the entire width of the sidewalk. We&apos;ll be walking towards each other and, without fail, they won&apos;t &apos;shrink&apos; to make room for anyone to pass. Is this a &apos;chicken&apos; kind of thing? First person to move loses?&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve talked about all kinds of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090708/http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette">urban etiquette</a> in the past, and often sidewalk use comes up, but only in regards to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090708/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/texting_zombies.php">texting zombies</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090708/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">slow tourists</a>... so this is an interesting question. <em>Are</em> you guys playing &quot;chicken&quot; on the sidewalks out there, or are you just totally oblivious to everyone else on the sidewalk? </p>
