<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143037/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/empires-batshit-crazy-behind-scenes-823518">The Hollywood Reporter</a> printed an interview with Lee Daniels, in which the <em>Empire</em> showrunner defends actor Terrence Howard, who carries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143037/http://nypost.com/2015/09/20/the-real-life-dark-side-of-empire-villain-terrence-howard/">a rap sheet</a> filled with assault charges.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;That poor boy,&quot; he says, fiercely protective of his actor. He then alludes to other actors who have been the subject of domestic abuse allegations in the past. &quot;[Terrence] ain&apos;t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he&apos;s some f&#x2014;in&apos; demon,&quot; says Daniels. &quot;That&apos;s a sign of the time, of race, of where we are right now in America.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Sean Penn (who also has a history filled with assault charges) did not like that comment, and would prefer to be known as a humanitarian, thankyouverymuch. Today he filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against Daniels in New York Supreme Court. The suit states that &quot;Daniels used &apos;reckless, false, and defamatory&apos; language to claim Penn has a history of abusing women and domestic assault,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143037/http://www.vulture.com/2015/09/sean-penn-sues-lee-daniels-for-defamation.html?mid=twitter_vulture">Vulture</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="PENNSUIT.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143037im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/PENNSUIT.jpg" width="640" height="494" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The complaint refers to Penn as &quot;one of this generation&apos;s most highly-acclaimed and greatest artists and humanitarians,&quot; also noting that &quot;unlike Howard [Penn] has never been arrested, much less convicted, for domestic violence, as his ex-wives (including Madonna) would confirm and attest.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Penn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143037/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/sean-penn-charged-battery-vandalism-land-actor-jail-year-article-1.174725">served 33 days</a> in prison for assaulting a paparazzi (by hanging him off a balcony by his ankles). And as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143037/http://www.buzzfeed.com/iramadison/there-was-no-psa-about-domestic-violence-when-sean-penn-pres#.puGLwnEM7">Buzzfeed recently recalled</a>, he was also &quot;charged with felony domestic assault on his then-wife Madonna,&quot; who he allegedly hit over the head with a baseball bat. &quot;He pled to a misdemeanor [and] avoided jail time for his assault.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143037/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2428903-penn.html">full suit is here</a>.</p>
