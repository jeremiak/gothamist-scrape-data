</div></div>					<p>As far as an underground typo is concerned, it&apos;s not all that important unless, say, the F train is donning an R. So we hope the folks at NYC Transit don&apos;t actually fix the harmless errors&#x2014;that would cost money, and it&apos;s sort of fun to spot these while waiting for the train to arrive. That said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407002242/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/09/subway_typo.php">last week</a> a reader noticed an over 70-year-old typo on a Brooklyn G train platform, which was quickly followed with more human spellcheckers sending in their own quirky finds (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407002242/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/11/new_express_train_to_brighten_beach.php">this one for &quot;Brighten&quot; Beach</a>). Here are the top typos&#x2014;send yours to tips(AT)gothamist(DOT)com and we&apos;ll add them!</p>

<p>And Forgotten NY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407002242/http://forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/subwayerrors/subwayerrors.html">takes a closer look at some more specific subway errors</a>, such as how signs point to the wrong streets or exits that are long closed.</p>
