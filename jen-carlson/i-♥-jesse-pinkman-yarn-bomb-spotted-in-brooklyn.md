<p>In August <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219134616/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/check_out_this_crocheted_breaking_b.php">a <em>Breaking Bad</em> yarn bomb</a> was spotted over in Bed-Stuy, a comforting little tribute to a show that had been giving us tiny heart attacks during the gut-wrenching final season. And following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219134616/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/breaking_bad_series_finale_recap.php">last night&apos;s finale</a>, a new piece of <em>Bad</em>-ass crochetti is on display. Sadly, our suggestion of &quot;Crochet, bitch!&quot; was not taken, instead, the crochet artist (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219134616/http://www.londonkaye.com/">London Kaye</a>) went all sentimental with: &quot;I &#x2665; Jesse Pinkman.&quot; </p>

<p>This simple declaration of love to Aaron Paul&apos;s character&#x2014;one every fan of the show can relate to&#x2014;was spotted at Dekalb and Spencer in Bed-Stuy... and we found it&apos;s best to gaze upon while listening to some Bon Iver.</p>

<p>If you spot any other homages to the show around town, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219134616/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">send them our way</a>.
