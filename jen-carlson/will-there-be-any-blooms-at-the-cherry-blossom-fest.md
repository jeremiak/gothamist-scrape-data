The fest isn&apos;t until May 1st, but their map is showing that all of the trees are currently in peak bloom! After that, it&apos;s post peak <em>doom</em>, with petals only covering the ground.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140411/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/17/all_panicatbotanic_2010_04_23_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the perfect window to view the trees will be closed by the event. One landscape architect told them, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m literally panicking for them about the timing of the festival. These buds look beautiful now, but they won&#x2019;t be perfect by May 1. It&#x2019;s a shame. They guessed wrong.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The date is chosen a year prior to the event, for planning purposes, and the director of horticulture at the garden told the paper, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re losing petals. But that&#x2019;s just what Mother Nature chose.&quot; So don&apos;t get your hopes up flower fans.</p>
