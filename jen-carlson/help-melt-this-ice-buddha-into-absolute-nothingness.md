title: Help Melt This Ice Buddha Into Absolute Nothingness
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="iceicebuddha0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041725im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/iceicebuddha0311.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We&apos;d rather see ice inside of a museum than falling from the sky, so we fully support the Rubin Museum of Art&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041725/http://www.rmanyc.org/events/load/1128">interactive ice installation</a>! Artist Atta Kim has sculpted a 5-foot, 1,300-pound ice Buddha, which will be unveiled tomorrow at 6 p.m., after which time the museum will be open for 24 hours so that visitors can interact with the installation. </p>

<p>How long do you think it will take to melt? The museum tells us they expect it to be around in some form or another into next week. Visitors can touch the sculpture, which will speed up the big melt, and will also be allowed to take away droplets of melted ice in traditional Japanese containers. </p>

<p>This sounds sort of depressing, like that time Frosty melted, but we suppose <em>nothing is permanent</em>.</p>
