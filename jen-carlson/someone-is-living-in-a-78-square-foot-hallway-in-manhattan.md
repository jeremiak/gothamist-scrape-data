</div></div>					<p>Move over, lady living in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023349/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/video_woman_shows_off_90-square-foo.php">a 90-square-foot <em>palace</em></a> on the Upper West Side&#x2014;there&apos;s a new tiny apartment in town. Meet Luke&apos;s 78-square-foot apartment, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023349/http://community.apartmenttherapy.com/contests/smallcool/2011/entries/2733">Apartment Therapy</a> has dubbed &quot;barely habitable,&quot; but really looks rather cute for a glorified hallway with no kitchen. </p>

<p>Luke (who doesn&apos;t specify which neighborhood he lives in) told the site, &quot;It&apos;s simple, efficient, convertible, and zen enough to be comfortably habitable,&quot; though there were some challenges. He says, &quot;I think such small spaces really need custom responses so i put together my own furnishing. The most challenging part was trying to build the bed/couch inside the space... rotating full 4x8 sheets of ply and playing the sliding square game but with furniture and building materials.&quot; Question, though... does that door near the couch go to a bathroom, a closet, or a brick wall?</p>
