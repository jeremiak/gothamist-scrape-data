<p>The great Dog Poop War of 2012 has been raging in Gramercy Park since April, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192559/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/spotted_sign_calling_out_dog_owners.php">by our watch</a>, and what started with a passive-aggressive note has now built up (as happens with one-sided &quot;conversations&quot;). This week one angry local has taped up <em>six</em> signs, declaring the area &quot;POOP ALLEY,&quot; and calling out dog owners for not cleaning up after their canines.</p>

<p>Sadly, not everyone who deals with their problems through anonymous letter writing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192559/http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/2012/06/18/or-ill-call-the-cops-maybe/">can be amusing</a>, but one passer-by, Gretchen Mayer, says it <em>is</em> &quot;the most exciting thing that&apos;s happened to the neighborhood in years.&quot; Or at least since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192559/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramercy_Park#In_popular_culture">Steely Dan</a>...</p>
