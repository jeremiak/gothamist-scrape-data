<p>Here&apos;s a 21-year-old, pre-<em>Kids</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123307/http://gothamist.com/tags/chloesevigny">Chlo&#xEB; Sevigny</a> playing air guitar, playing dress up, and playing with her pals all over Manhattan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123307/http://www.nowness.com/day/2013/3/28/2904/chloe-sevignys-90s-throwback-part-two/">Nowness notes</a> this two-part short film was &quot;shot as an original video campaign for X-Girl, the preppy downtown fashion line and one of the many collaborative projects conceived by Sonic Youth&apos;s Kim Gordon.&quot; Sevigny talked about the short, admitting she thought people might think of it as boring, and that it was &quot;supposed to be like Godard.&quot; </p>

<p>She also discussed a photo of herself and Larry Clark currently hanging at the New Museum&#x2014;&quot;I moved to NYC June of 1993, but I think that was shot earlier in the year when I was still visiting. I&#x2019;m trying to think of the length of my hair because I was always shaving it that year. There&#x2019;s a tank top, the ringer tees, stars of course were very popular in the 90s, so I feel like my outfit is very emblematic of 1993. It was shot in Larry&#x2019;s apartment. I think I went over there with Harmony. He was already photographing us and making weird little videos and stuff.&quot;</p>
