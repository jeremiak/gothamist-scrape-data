<p>John Amato, president of Show Media, is giving himself (and all art lovers) another gift this year. Show Media sells the ad space on many of New York&apos;s taxis, and thanks to Amato 500 of them will be featuring the art of artists Chuck Close and Kehinde Wiley (this is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140117162858/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/27/taxi_cabs_turn_into_art_shows.php">2nd year</a> he&apos;s doing this, last year featured Yoko Ono and Alex Katz). Amato says, &quot;Art is a great passion of mine, and I am very fortunate to be in a place in my life where I can do this as my annual holiday gift not just to myself, but to everyone who enjoys seeing the art as it travels around New York City&#x2019;s streets.&quot; Consider this a $100,000 roaming art exhibit!</p>
