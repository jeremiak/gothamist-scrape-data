The discount jewelry store, Ladies and Gents, opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144848/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/gage_tollner_space.php">earlier this summer</a>, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144848/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/big_stink_over_pink_gage_tollner_XFwnAgBZ0ekFObIcFqDYWN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a> reports that they&apos;ve brought in hot pink walls.<p></p>

<p>The Landmark Preservation Commission isn&apos;t happy about the 119-year-old building, which still has its original gas-lit chandeliers, getting such a colorful makeover. Last week inspectors served the operators of the store a notice for illegally installing pink partitions just inches away from the original walls. They have until next week to take them down, or else they&apos;ll be fined.</p>

<p>Later this year you&apos;ll be able to see Gage &amp; Tollner in its old school, mobster glory when it&apos;s featured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144848/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/boardwalk_empire_filming_at_gage_to.php">on <em>Boardwalk Empire</em></a>.</p>
