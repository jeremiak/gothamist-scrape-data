<p>The gorgeous Childs Restaurant that&apos;s been sitting in beautiful decay in Coney Island as an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023240/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/realestate/streetscapes-former-childs-restaurant-coney-island-colorful-terra-cotta-stucco.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Streetscapes%20Childs%20Restaurants&amp;st=cse">abandoned landmark</a> for<em>ever</em> (except for its brief stint as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023240/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/06/lola_staar_loses_roller_rink.php">a roller rink</a>) might get a new life. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023240/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/167315/ny1-exclusive--sources-detail-new-coney-island-development-plans">NY1 is reporting</a> that the city is in talks about turning it into an entertainment complex, which has been a dream of borough president Marty Markowitz for years (though it would also make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023240/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/08/marty_markowitz_uses_ipad_to_beg_fo.php">a nice Apple Store</a>). Sources told NY1 that Markowitz has now raised around $50 million to make that dream a reality.</p>

<p>Coney Island historian Charles Denson told them, &quot;I think it would be incredible if the Childs building was re-opened as an entertainment venue. It&apos;s one of the gems of Coney Island. The arches in front have the most beautiful terracotta. It&apos;s all nautical themed.&quot; </p>

<p>He did not comment, however, on the possibility of a Hooters moving into the neighborhood. Apparently they want to establish themselves in the community as well, but thankfully not in the landmarked Childs Restaurant building.</p>
