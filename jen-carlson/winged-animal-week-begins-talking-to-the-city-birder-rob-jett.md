We talked to Rob Jett, who runs weekly birdwatching tours in Green-Wood Cemetery (Wednesdays) and Prospect Park (Tuesdays), logging what he spots with his binoculars on his blog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618005500/http://citybirder.blogspot.com/">The City Birder</a>. Below, Jett tells us what kind of birds one can expect to see around these parts if they look close enough, and more.</em></p>

<p><strong>How long have you been birdwatching in NYC?</strong> I picked up my first pair of binoculars a little over 20 years ago, however, it took another couple of years for me to become passionate about birding.</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of birds are most common around here?</strong> The answer to this question is a bit complicated. There are some species of birds that call NYC home all year. That number fluctuates greatly from season to season, with huge increases of migrating bird species during the Spring and Fall. There are some birds that migrate to the five boroughs just to nest, as well as, others that only spend the Winter here. On average, the Big Apple sees over 200 species of birds a year. That said, some of the most common species were actually introduced to North America from Europe. They would be Mute Swan, Rock Pigeon, European Starling and House Sparrow. The most common native birds are Canada Goose, Mallard, Herring Gull, Mourning Dove, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker, Blue Jay, American Crow, Black-capped Chickadee, Tufted Titmouse, American Robin, Song Sparrow and Northern Cardinal.</p>

<p><strong>Where are the best places to go birdwatching here?</strong> It depends on the time of year. During the Spring migration and the Summer months, most of the city parks, such as Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, Central and Inwood Hill Parks in Manhattan, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Forest Park in Queens and Conference House Park on Staten Island. Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Queens is one of the few locations that is excellent for birding throughout the year. Over the last few years I&apos;ve discovered that Coney Island is a very good place to look for birds and other wildlife during the cold, winter months.</p>

<p><strong>And what&apos;s the best time to go?</strong> Birds are most active early in the morning. For the dedicated birder, it is not unusual to begin birding at dawn. A family of colorful songbirds known as wood-warblers are passing through NYC right now, with the peak of diversity and abundance climaxing usually around mid-May. The experience of standing in the middle of one NYCs park&apos;s to hear the &quot;Dawn Chorus&quot; of this influx of birds is second to none.</p>

<p><strong>What are some of the more rare sightings you&apos;ve had?</strong> The rarest sighting, by far, occurred in Coney Island last July. The bird was a Gray-hooded Gull. This species is normally only found in parts of South America, as well as, western Africa. It was only the second time this species was recorded in North America and became a bit of an overnight celebrity with plenty of media coverage. Hardcore birdwatchers flew into New York City from all over the country to get a glimpse of this lovely bird with the matching bright red bill and legs, and pale yellow eyes.</p>

<p>Each year NYC and the surrounding area hosts a handful of bird species that are relatively rare, usually strays from other parts of the country. In addition to the Gray-hooded Gull, in the past 20 years I&apos;ve observed a few other species that are normally found outside of North America. They are:</p><ul><li>Tufted Duck, from Northern Eurasia.<br>
</li><li>Western Reef Heron, found in West Africa, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and east to India.<br>
</li><li>Broad-billed Sandpiper, only one sighting in NYS. Found in south and south-east Asia to Australia.<br>
</li><li>Red-necked Stint, breeds in eastern Eurasia.<br>
</li><li>Sharp-tailed Sandpiper, breeds in northeast Asia.<br>
</li><li>Ivory Gull, technically North American, however their circumpolar range is usually just limited to Greenland, northernmost North America, and Eurasia. Extremely rare this far south.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>Is there a bird you&apos;ve been hoping to see but haven&apos;t yet?</strong> Wow, that&apos;s a tough question. It would be more like a list because of all the birds ever recorded in New York, I&apos;ve probably only seen about half. If I had to choose, though, it would be the Atlantic Puffin, probably because they are so cute. I&apos;ve been on a few pelagic trips hoping to see one, but have always struck out. On a trip to Washington state I saw many of their west coast cousins, the Tufted Puffin, and they were very cool. Being that NYC is nearly surrounded by water, you&apos;d think I would have spotted one by now.</p>

<p><strong>What can people expect on your tours?</strong> Birdwatching helps us connect, not only with the birds in our urban environment, but all the complex elements connected to this diverse family of animals. While my tours are mostly about the birds around us, I try to teach people a little bit about the plants, insects and other wildlife. Participants are usually very surprised with what NYC has to offer once they begin to look at the natural world entwined with our bustling metropolis.</p>

<p><strong>A lot of people joke that the pigeon is the official bird of NYC, but what would you say it is?</strong> I think pigeons are a lot like New Yorkers in that they are, ultimately, immigrants that have adapted supremely well to the resources at hand. Plus, like us, they are incredibly abundant. However, if I had to choose a native species, it would be the Red-tailed Hawk. This raptor has evolved to be the perfect generalist. They can be found in nearly every habitat in North America where they are always the top of the food chain. In New York City they have built their nests on top of valued real estate along 5th Avenue, in trees in almost every park and in our national landmarked cemeteries, they&apos;ve had their offspring named after famous theaters, people have set up dedicated webcams so we can watch their nests, authors have written acclaimed books about them and filmmakers have produced award winning documentaries about them. I don&apos;t think there is any other species of bird in New York City that can garner that degree of respect, awe and celebrity.</p>

<p><em>If you decide to do some birdwatching, take one of Jett&apos;s tours, or if you go solo, brush up on the American Birding Association&apos;s &quot;Principles Of Birding Ethics&quot; first&#x2014;you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618005500/http://www.aba.org/about/ethics.html">read that here</a>.</em></p>
