</div></div>					<p>Author and photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326211811/http://www.lisakahane.com/">Lisa Kahane</a> spent a good deal of the 1980s documenting the South Bronx, which at the time was plagued by arson, disease, poor economic planning and displacement. She captured &quot;the human side of urban decay&quot; as the neighborhood fell apart and tried to pick itself back up. She now shows it all, decades later, in her book <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326211811/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157687432X/?tag=gothamist03-20">Do Not Give Way To Evil: Photographs of the South Bronx, 1979-1987</a></em> -- here are some images from it.</p>
