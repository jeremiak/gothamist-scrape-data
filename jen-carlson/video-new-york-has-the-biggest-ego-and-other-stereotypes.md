title: Video: New York Has The Biggest Ego, And Other Stereotypes
---

<p>Author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110601173303/http://www.paulpjury.com/index.php?entry=12">Paul Jury</a>, currently out with a book called <em>States of Confusion</em>, has put together this gem of a video to promote his tome. Here he takes a look at 50 State Stereotypes in 2 minutes. For New York, he says: &quot;World&apos;s 14th biggest city, 1st biggest ego.&quot; That isn&apos;t our only mention in the video, however, for New Jersey he reinterprets <em>Jersey Shore</em>&apos;s G.T.L., saying the state is known for &quot;Guidos, Turnpikes, and Leaching off New York.&quot;</p>
