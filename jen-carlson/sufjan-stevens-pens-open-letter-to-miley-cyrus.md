<blockquote>&quot;Dear Miley. 

<p>I can&#x2019;t stop listening to #GetItRight (great song, great message, great body), but maybe you need a quick grammar lesson. One particular line causes concern: &apos;I been laying in this bed all night long.&apos; Miley, technically speaking, you&#x2019;ve been LYING, not LAYING, an irregular verb form that should only be used when there&#x2019;s an object, i.e. &apos;I been laying my tired booty on this bed all night long.&apos; </p>

<p>Whatever. I&#x2019;m not the best lyricist, but you know what I mean. #Get It Right The Next Time. But don&#x2019;t worry, even Faulkner messed it up. We all make mistakes, and surely this isn&#x2019;t your worst misdemeanor. </p>

<p>But also, Miley, did you know the tense here is also totally wrong. Surely you&#x2019;ve heard of Present Perfect Continuous Tense (I HAVE BEEN LYING in this bed all night long [hopefully getting some beauty sleep?]). It&#x2019;s a weird, equivocal, almost purgatorial tense, not quite present, not quite past, not quite here, not quite there. Somewhere in between. I feel that way all the time. It kind of sucks. But I have a feeling your &apos;present perfect continuous&apos; involves a lot more excitement than mine. </p>

<p>Anyway, doesn&#x2019;t that also sum up your career right now? Present. Perfect. Continuous. And Tense. Intense? Girl, you work it like Mike Tyson. Miley, I love you because you&#x2019;re the Queen, grammatically and anatomically speaking. And you&#x2019;re the hottest cake in the pan. Don&#x2019;t ever grow old. Live brightly before your fire fades into total darkness. </p>

<p>XXOO Sufjan&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Dear Sufjan Stevens, Please consider this our own open letter to you, requesting that you please come over to our office and perform #GetItRight with the correct grammar in place. (#ForReal) Love, Gothamist</p>
