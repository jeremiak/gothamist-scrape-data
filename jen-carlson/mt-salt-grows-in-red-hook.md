<p>There&apos;s been chatter of a giant salt pile growing over at the Red Hook Marine Terminal, and word is there&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170412170019/http://wordoncolumbiastreet.blogspot.com/2009/04/emergency-neighborhood-meeting-about.html">emergency meeting</a> regarding the nuisance tonight. A reader residing on the Columbia Street waterfront in Brooklyn told us, &quot;Salt is flying all over the neighborhood as trucks ride on top of it 24hrs a day. Everyone&apos;s cars, apartments (if your windows are open), bikes, and yards now have a salty film on them. Breathing in our neighborhood cannot be healthy, and many neighbors have developed a cough and talk about the constant salty taste in their mouths.&quot; Allegedly no one addressed the community about the pile, and now 311 has been bombarded with calls complaining about it, especially after the tarp was removed in recent months.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170412170019/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/nyregion/27pile.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">The NY Times</a> talked to an employee of American Stevedoring, the company responsible for the salt, who said it&apos;s only being temporarily stored at the terminal before being shipped throughout the state. He told them, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re taking every safety measure. There&#x2019;s no harm from the salt.&#x201D;</p>
