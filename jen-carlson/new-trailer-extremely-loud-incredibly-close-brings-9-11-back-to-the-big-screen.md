<p>Jonathan Safran Foer&apos;s 2005 novel <em>Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close</em> was adapted to fit the big screen, and after months <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520030103/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/now_filming_jonathan_safran_foer.php">of filming</a> around New York City, the film finally has a trailer. It will be out on Christmas Day this year, and stars Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Thomas Horn, James Gandolfini, Zoe Caldwell, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, and Max von Sydow. </p>

He &quot;begins searching New York City for the lock that fits a mysterious key he found in his father&apos;s closet. His journey through the five boroughs takes him beyond his own loss to a greater understanding of the observable world around him.&quot;</p>
