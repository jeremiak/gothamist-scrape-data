					<p>One of our favorite NYC Things is that you can still touch centuries-old pieces of the city, and one of the oldest and coolest things you can lay your hands on is inside <em>another</em> really old and cool thing! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043238/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/04/flashback_croton_reservoir.php">Croton Reservoir</a> was a massive above-ground reservoir that held 20 million gallons of water&#x2014;it boasted walls 50-feet tall and 25-feet wide, and stood where the New York Public Library stands today. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043238/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypl">the Library</a> was built, some of its remains were left intact. Those remains are currently down a staircase leading to an auditorium.</p>

<p>The NYPL&apos;s Angela Montefinise tells us that anyone can see these remains&#x2014;&quot;you can still see it on the lower level of South Court in the Schwarzman Building (near the auditorium). It&apos;s not closed off. If you walk into South Court on the first floor and look down, you can see it (if you don&apos;t want to go all the way downstairs).&quot; But while it&apos;s open to the public, it&apos;s only open &quot;when the auditorium is in use for a public program. If there&apos;s no program it&apos;s not open, but once can still see the Croton remains by looking over the railing on the first floor of South Court.&quot; There&apos;s also a plaque located in the subway system&#x2014;on a wall in the passageway that connects the 5th Avenue station and 42nd Street station.</p>

<p>A few more facts about the reservoir:<br>
</p><ul><li>To build it, the adjacent plot (now Bryant Park) also needed to be cleared, which meant exhuming thousands of bodies and transporting them to Wards Island, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043238/http://www.bryantpark.org/about-us/history.html">the land there was a potter&apos;s field</a> at the time. <br>
</li><li>The project was completed in 1842&#x2014;a moment historian Henry Collins Brown called &quot;the greatest forward stride in the city&apos;s history, [with] the general introduction of running water.&quot;<br>
</li><li>In an 1844 edition of the Columbia Spy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043238/http://books.google.com/books?id=0ajYl9fPDfMC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;lpg=PA412&amp;dq=edgar+allen+poe+%22When+you+visit+Gotham%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HhtHssXRVt&amp;sig=8RhJjwgYDMCOS6dHMX5HKD9d-bw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k8tqS9rDOsGA8QbesLmEBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Edgar Allen Poe wrote</a>, &#x201C;When you visit Gotham, you should ride out Fifth Avenue, as far as the distributing reservoir, near Forty-third Street, I believe. The prospect from the walk around the reservoir is particularly beautiful. You can see, from this elevation, the north reservoir at Yorkville; the whole city to the Battery; and a large portion of the harbor, and long reaches of the Hudson and East Rivers.&quot; That elevation Poe referred to was from the promenade, which hosted gatherings on a daily basis, making for a &quot;delightful scene at night, with the moonlight dancing on the water.&quot; <br>
</li><li>By 1902, it was already torn down and the cornerstone was laid for the library&apos;s main branch.</li></ul><p></p>
