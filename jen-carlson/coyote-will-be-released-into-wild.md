										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_032_coyotelin.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200007im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2010_032_coyotelin.jpg" width="260" height="184" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s been one day since the fugitive coyote landed in the hands of The Man after a daring dodge down the West Side Highway&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200007/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/coyote_captured_after_bike_lane_run.php">bike lane</a>. Where is she now? (Yep, its a girl!) </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200007/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/25/2010-03-25_not_wiley_enough_cops_corral_roving_tribeca_coyote_along_west_side_highway.html">the Daily News</a>, after she was hit with a tranquilizer dart in a parking lot on Watts Street, the one year old was transported to Animal Care &amp; Control&apos;s headquarters where she was given a rabies shot. Reportedly in good health, she&apos;ll be released back into the wild&#x2014;to a location that&apos;s yet to be determined.</p>

<p>Now, what about all those <em>other</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200007/http://gothamist.com/tags/coyote">coyotes</a> lurking in Gotham&apos;s shadows? We&apos;ve asked the Parks Department for an update on this tribe of wild animals, but they have been suspiciously quiet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427200007/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1260861/Coyote-evades-New-York-police-2-days-Manhattan.html?ITO=1490">Daily Mail</a> has some amazing photos of the coyote&apos;s run through Manhattan, and reminds us that in 1998, a statue was put up at Van Cortlandt Park in honor of &quot;the first confirmed coyote sighting in New York City since 1946.&quot;</p>
