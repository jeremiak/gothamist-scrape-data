</div></div>					<p>[<strong>UPDATE:</strong> The latest word is that NASA has changed the&#x2014;still tentative&#x2014;date to this Friday morning. Updates to come as they confirm.] Yesterday the Space Shuttle Enterprise was scheduled to arrive in New York City (<em>finally</em>&#x2014;it&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329161915/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/12/shuttle_enterpise_is_coming_to_the.php">over a year since the announcement</a>), but weather postponed its trip. Now NASA has selected tomorrow (Wednesday) morning for its fly-over and landing at JFK airport. The date is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329161915/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/transition/home/enterprise_flight_postponed.html">still tentative</a>, but weather-permitting you can expect the Shuttle to be doing a low fly-over between 9:30 and 11 a.m., before landing at the airport. Following that, the Enterprise will be &quot;demated&quot; from the 747 and placed on a barge that will be tugged up the Hudson River to its new home at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in June.</p>

<p>Get your cameras ready and stake out a spot for tomorrow morning&#x2014;while NASA says a route is still being determined, their previous announcements have had it flying over the Statue of Liberty and the Intrepid, meaning even those in New Jersey will have a sweet view of &quot;the World&apos;s Greatest Piggyback Ride&quot; (as pictured, it will be arriving atop a 747).</p>

<p>We&apos;re told that NASA will make a final determination today, at which time we&apos;ll update this post with firmer details. Until then, click through for photos of the Shuttle &quot;mating&quot; with the 747 it will arrive on (that&apos;s the official term <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329161915/http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/7096194079/in/photostream">used by NASA</a>!).</p>
