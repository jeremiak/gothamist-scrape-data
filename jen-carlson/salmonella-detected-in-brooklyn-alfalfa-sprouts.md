Specifically, alfalfa sprouts packaged at Snow White Food Products... located at 621 Bergen Street in Brooklyn. <em>Dun dun dun</em>. The New York State Agriculture Commissioner, Patrick Hooker, alerted consumers of the recall today, noting a presence of Salmonella was found.</p>

<p>If you have a 3.5 ounce plastic clamshell container of this stuff, you should consider tossing it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140508070013/http://readme.readmedia.com/Consumer-Alert-Salmonella-in-Alfalfa-Sprouts/1696529">A little background</a>: &quot;Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea that may be bloody, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.&quot; No illnesses have been reported due to the sprouts... <em>yet</em>.</p>

<p>As for the egg recall, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140508070013/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/19/AR2010081904128.html">hasn&apos;t reached New York</a>. However, over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140508070013/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/egg-recall_b_687882.html">HuffPo</a> <em>Animal Factory</em> author David Kirby warns of buying cheap, factory farm eggs&#x2014;noting that spending the extra cash on organic, humanely produced eggs is worthwhile since Salmonella &quot;is largely a problem for factory-farmed eggs.&quot;</p>
