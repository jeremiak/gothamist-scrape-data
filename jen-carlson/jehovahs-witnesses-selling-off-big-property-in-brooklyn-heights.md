<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105500/http://gothamist.com/tags/jehovahswitnesses">Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses</a> have been slowly making their exodus from Brooklyn Heights, and their massive building on Columbia Heights is the latest to go on the market. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105500/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">brutalist</a>-inspired building overlooks Brooklyn Bridge Park and features a massive sign that reads &quot;WATCHTOWER,&quot; along with an illuminated display showing the time and temperature.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105500/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2015/12/3/breaking-news-jehovahs-witnesses-put-brooklyn-heights-headquarters-sale">announcement of the sale</a> of 25-30 Columbia Heights was made last night by the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses&apos; Office of Public Information. John Warren tells us, &quot;We do not have an asking price for [the 773,000-square-feet complex or] any of our available properties but are inviting qualified buyers to present offers.&quot; Some of their other buildings similar to this one in the area are primed to become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105500/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/01/dumbo_heights.php">a tech hub</a>.</p>

<p>124 Columbia Heights and 85 Jay Street are also on the market&#x2014;the listings, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105500/https://www.watchtowerbrooklynrealestate.com/">Watchtower Brooklyn Real Estate</a> note that anyone wishing to view the properties must &quot;sign a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement.&quot; The property at 25-30 Columbia Heights still serves as the headquarters.</p>

<p>The Witnesses are relocating upstate (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105500/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/01/brunch_hate_reads_brooklyn_burbs.php">right on trend</a>!), and are expected to be all moved out of Heights in 2017.</p>
