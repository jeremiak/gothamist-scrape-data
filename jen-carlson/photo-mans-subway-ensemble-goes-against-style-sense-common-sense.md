<p>Usually we focus on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022136/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a>, but right now we&apos;re gonna take a brief trip into the terrifying world of subway fashion don&apos;ts. Meet <em>this guy</em>, who wore a shirt with giant letters emblazoned across it that spell out: &quot;Rich White N#gga,&quot; or, once translated: &quot;please fuck with me.&quot; To go along with his statement tee he chose a black skirt, ill-fitting cowboy boots, a baseball cap, and glasses. Also, a mysterious black plastic bag. The result is part &quot;creepy neighbor who keeps to himself&quot; and part &quot;middle-aged hipster trying too hard.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;re no experts on style, so we turned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022136/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/it_happened_to_me_i_wore_meggings_a.php#photo-1">fashion explorer</a> Jake Dobkin for his thoughts on the ensemble&#x2014;but even he wouldn&apos;t touch it, telling us over Gchat as he adjusted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022136/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/26/zubaz_one_journalists_day_in_the_wo.php#photo-1">his Zubaz</a>: &quot;I don&apos;t want my name connected with that.&quot;</p>

<p>Update: One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022136/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1fpomv/rich_white_ngga_another_nyc_subway_wtf/">Redditor</a> says he&apos;s &quot;very nice&quot; and in a &quot;hilarious band&quot;&#x2014;one of his videos can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022136/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BOM_9y5GF0">seen here</a>.</p>
