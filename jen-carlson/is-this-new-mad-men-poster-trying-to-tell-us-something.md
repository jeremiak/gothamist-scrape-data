<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="SMmadmenposter0212.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170410im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/SMmadmenposter0212.jpeg" width="242" height="300" class="image-right"> </span>The countdown is on to the long-awaited return of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170410/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a>, which will start up again with a fifth season on March 25th (the premiere will basically be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170410/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/17/mad_men_5th_season_premiere_will_be.php">two hour movie</a>). We&apos;ve seen their first promotional campaign already (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170410/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/02/mad_men_posters_get_tagged_untagged.php#photo-1">the falling man image</a>), and now they&apos;ve released round two, which is very different. The show&apos;s creator, Matthew Weiner, discussed the new poster&#x2014;which features Don Draper staring into a Manhattan storefront featuring a nude mannequin&#x2014;telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170410/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/business/media/as-mad-men-returns-amcs-ads-take-an-enigmatic-tack.html?_r=2&amp;smid=tw-nytimestv&amp;seid=auto">the NY Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;This is a dreamlike image,&#x201D; Mr. Weiner said, likening it to work of the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, who specialized in surreal, mannequin-like figures. The image is &#x201C;a nonverbal representation of where my head is at and where the show will be,&#x201D; Mr. Weiner said. <strong>&#x201C;By the end of the season I guarantee you&#x2019;ll know what it is about.&#x201D;</strong></blockquote>

<p>What does it mean?! Will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170410/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093493/">Andrew McCarthy</a> show up? Is it a reference to Hugh Hefner and Don&apos;s playboy ways? And why didn&apos;t they use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170410/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/20/mannequin.php">Cynthia, the famous Manhattan mannequin</a>?</p>
