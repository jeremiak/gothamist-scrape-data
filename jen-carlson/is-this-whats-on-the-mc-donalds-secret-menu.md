<p>Yesterday a Redditor posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509001232/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vnq5w/iama_mcdonalds_employee_who_has_seen_the_worst_of/">an &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session</a>, announcing he was an employee at a McDonald&apos;s &quot;who has seen the worst of the worst customer incidents, altercations, and overall rudeness of human beings.&quot; He also talked about secret menu items. Here&apos;s what we learned through the AMA, which featured other McDonald&apos;s employees posting items created at their franchises.</p>

<p>From yesterday&apos;s AMA we learn there are at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509001232/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vnq5w/iama_mcdonalds_employee_who_has_seen_the_worst_of/c564tz2">five secret menu items</a> (you can see some of them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509001232/http://www.ranker.com/list/mcdonald_s-secret-menu-items/secret-menu-items">here</a>):</p>

<p><strong>The McKinley Mac</strong>: a Big Mac with Quarter Pounder patties<br>
<strong>The All American</strong>: hamburger with pickles and ketchup<br>
<strong>The Neapolitan Milkshake</strong>: a chocolate, vanilla, strawberry mix<br>
<strong>The McLeprichon</strong>: Shamrock Shake mixed with chocolate shake!<br>
<strong>Biscuits &amp; Gravy</strong> (only in the South)</p>

<p>However, people have been getting creative elsewhere&#x2014;one former McDonald&apos;s employee says, &quot;when the McFlurry came out&#x2014;I think we invented the Apple Pie/Cherry Pie McFlurry. Also, we made Grilled Cheese (take the bun of a burger, hit it with the butter from the biscuits in the morning... we made Coke/Root Beer floats if asked, and pretty much anything that wasn&apos;t crazy on that list.&quot;</p>
