<p>The highly-anticipated Hulu series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830160541/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/16/the_handmaids_tale.php"><em>The Handmaid&apos;s Tale</em></a>, based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830160541/https://www.amazon.com/Handmaids-Tale-Margaret-Atwood/dp/038549081X/">novel by Margaret Atwood</a>, won&apos;t hit the streaming platform until April 26th... and at the rate we&apos;re going, we could be living this dystopian nightmare by then. Certain scenes in the first episode feel eerily close to where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830160541/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Trump&apos;s administration</a> is steering this flaming car. In one scene, a gay man and a doctor who gives abortions are publicly hung with bags over their head featuring the symbol of their &quot;crime.&quot; </p>

<p>You&apos;ll get a glimpse of this in Hulu&apos;s first Super Bowl ad (their first for an original production) aimed at &quot;spotlighting the series&quot; (which was produced by MGM Television), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830160541/http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/elisabeth-moss-endures-a-dystopian-nightmare-in-hulus-first-super-bowl-ad-for-an-original-series/">AdWeek reports</a>, which &quot;could finally bring the streaming service the same critical acclaim enjoyed by its competitors, Netflix and Amazon.&quot;</p>

<p>Here it is, a fictional look at what would happen if the U.S. government were overthrown by a fundamentalist theocracy that enslaved women and stripped away everything that America once stood for. Enjoy!</p>
