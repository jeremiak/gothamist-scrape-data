We just received this disturbing report involving one gay man and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824232808/http://unionpool.net/">Union Pool</a> bouncer: </p>

<blockquote>Saturday night one my friends, Charlie, was beaten up by a bouncer at Union Pool after a gay dance party there. From all accounts, it was unfounded and out of nowhere, and we shouldn&apos;t let this slide!!!

<p>Union pool is (for better or for worse) a Williamsburg institution, and it doesn&apos;t make sense for them to have bouncers who make a pretty significant portion of their patrons feel unsafe. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Apparently the bouncer became agitated by the crowd who were bemoaning the early closure of the bar. The bouncer put this particular patron in a headlock and started accompanying him out the door, then pushed him to the floor and &quot;beat him bloody.&quot; The victim now has &quot;big bruises around his eyes, marks on his neck like he&apos;s been strangled, and popped blood vessels in one of his eyes.&quot; If you think this is an isolated incident, there was another mention of the bad behavior at this bar when Gridskipper posted on it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824232808/http://gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/union-pool-in-williamsburg-192974.php#c1413170">A comment</a> on the post, left just last month, reads:</p>

<blockquote>RACIST and HOMOPHOBIC. my gay friends get violently, physically kicked out because they were playing tiny fake maracas by the outside patio door. I&apos;ll let you draw the conclusions.</blockquote>

<p>The tipster suggests emailing or calling Union Pool. The contact info is on the front page of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824232808/http://unionpool.net/">their website</a>. Good and bad experiences you&apos;ve had at Union Pool, or other venues/bars, welcome in the comments. We&apos;ve called Union Pool for their side of the story but as of yet haven&apos;t reached anyone there. </p>
