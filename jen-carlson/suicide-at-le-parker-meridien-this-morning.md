There were plenty of unlucky people who stumbled across the aftermath on their morning commutes, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102613/http://twitter.com/tombudd/statuses/12106568802">Tweeting</a>, &quot;This Morning I walked past a dead mangled body on 56th in front of the Le Parker Meridian. Someone jumped off the top of the hotel.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102613/http://twitter.com/erikprice/statuses/12105280907">Another</a> noted that as of 10 a.m. there was still &quot;something under a white sheet in front of the 56th Street entrance... something tells me it&apos;s not a pothole.&quot; We&apos;ll update when more information becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624102613/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/man_jumps_to_death_from_parker_meridian_abE2BIouNI8G4h4SBqN0JM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, it was a 39-year-old Manhattan man who took his life this morning (just before 8 a.m.) on West 56th Street, jumping from the pool area on the 42nd floor of Le Parker Meridien Hotel. He wasn&apos;t a guest there, but gained access by asking employees to view the pool, which is in the hotel&apos;s Gravity Fitness Center.</p>

<p>Los Angeles Angels catcher Jeff Mathis told the paper: &quot;I didn&apos;t even know what had happened but it&apos;s kind of scary to see [the aftermath].&quot; For those who didn&apos;t see it, the paper reports back with disturbing details, noting &quot;his body bounced off the curb and landed on West 56th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues.&quot; A witness told them, &quot;It was so loud I thought it was the facade of the building, but then I looked down and saw it wasn&apos;t debris. There was a face attached to it, and I couldn&apos;t believe it.&quot;</p>
