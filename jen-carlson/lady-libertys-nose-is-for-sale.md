<p>Lady Liberty is selling herself! A 2-foot chunk of her nose, one of four crafted during the 1980s restorations, is being auctioned off next month. A rep from Guernsey&apos;s Auction House told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421125341/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pick_lady_liberty_old_nose_XzDMJwbUmSGlyFVFbcZ5HO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, &quot;It&apos;s the tip of the nose with the area around the nostrils. It doesn&apos;t sound like it would be, but it&apos;s fairly attractive looking.&quot; One of the four is owned by a private collector, while another was destroyed, and another replaced her old nose. The auction is on September 24th at the Park Avenue armory. Any bidders?</p>

<p>Last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421125341/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/17/statue.php">we looked back</a> at photos from when the Statue of Liberty was being assembled in 1886. Pictured is her original nose from that time, which was part of the 350 individual pieces shipped here&#x2014;her nose, in total, is 4 1/2 feet.</p>
