<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523114620/http://www.recordstoreday.com/Home">Record Store Day</a> is tomorrow (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523114620/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/record_store_day.php">here&apos;s a list of great record stores</a> you can go to tomorrow <em>and always</em>... until they are replaced with a soulless bank or whatever). Even if you aren&apos;t a hardcore collector of non-digital music, it&apos;s worth checking out for the special offerings. Like tomorrow you&apos;ll find a 12&quot; vinyl of <em>No Alternative</em>, which turns 20 this year [pause to reflect on your age] and has never been released on vinyl before. Do you remember it? </p>

<p>From Record Store Day&apos;s announcement: &quot;The groundbreaking compilation produced to benefit AIDS relief. Features the biggest acts that defined 90s alt rock including Beastie Boys, Pavement, Soundgarden, Nirvana. 2LP Gatefold, 180 g, Numbered, never before on vinyl!&quot;<br>
 <br>
Personally, I totally forgot about this compilation (which definitely had a place with the rest of my CDs on the bench seats of my cherry red Plymouth Reliant in high school) until seeing the announcement. But one look at the cover images and now I&apos;m having all sorts of &apos;90s nostalgia <em>feelings</em>, so if you are too... dive right in:</p>

<p><strong>MTV</strong> had a No Alternative week!<br>

<p>... and I highly recommend revisiting it (Smashing Pumpkins around the 20-minute mark):<br>
