<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151931/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/03/03/looking_into_th.php">the Oscars coming up tonight</a>, we thought we&apos;d recap our favorite <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> parodies. Our nominees...</p>

<p>-Brokeback to the Future [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151931/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyEj_GeN4qE&amp;search=brokeback">watch here</a>]</p>

<p>-Star Wars: The Empire Brokeback [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151931/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omB18oRsBYg&amp;search=brokeback">watch here</a>]</p>

<p>-Brokeback Island [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151931/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0asZjjT1fI0&amp;search=brokeback%20lost">watch here</a>]</p>

<p>-Broke Mac Mountain [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151931/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a10ZezCt1Ms&amp;search=broke%20mac">watch here</a>]</p>

<p>If forced to choose, we&apos;d have to dub the winner Broke Mac Mountain, we just love parodies with IT guys in it...</p>

</p><p>Hopefully there will be something new to parody soon, we&apos;re getting tired of the Brokeback Mountain and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811151931/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2005/12/19/none_more_amusi.php">Lazy Sunday</a> spoofs. Well, sort of.</p>
