<p>The MTA has just announced that they are banning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/tags/hoverboards">hoverboards</a>, those popular personal transportation devices that have co-opted the &quot;hoverboard&quot; name despite not having the ability to hover. Last year it was revealed that these things were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/mcfly_and_get_fined.php">illegal in NYC</a> (including in the subway system), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/hoverboard_overboard.php">a law</a> that didn&apos;t seem to be known by many, or enforced by the NYPD. Once it was brought to light, however, some politicians began pushing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/10/hoverboards_still_illegal.php">make them legal</a> in certain designated areas of NYC, including sidewalks. Mayor de Blasio and  Police Commissioner Bratton have both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/hoverboards_bratton_nope.php">expressed concern</a> over making them legal here, and now it looks like Big Hoverboard has taken another hit with this MTA ban.</p>

<p>The MTA&apos;s announcement states that the &quot;possession of hoverboards aboard trains or buses or at stations of the New York City Subway, New York City Buses, Long Island Railroad, Metro-North Railroad, Staten Island Railway or Access-A-Ride is prohibited.&quot; </p>

<p>The MTA has long prohibited wheeled devices like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/23/video_skateboarder_jumps_the_tracks.php">skateboards</a>, skates, and scooters in their train stations. However, there&apos;s a secondary concern with hoverboards, as they&apos;ve been known to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/hoverboard_peril.php">burst into flames and blow up</a>&#x2014;the MTA notes that customers are prohibited from bringing &quot;hazaradous and flammable materials into the public transportation network.&quot; </p>

<p>So whether you&apos;re riding them or not, it your potentially explosive hoverboards are no longer welcome on mass transit.  The prohibition will supposedly be enforced by the MTA Police Department (on Metro-North, LIRR, and SI Railway), and the NYPD on trains and buses. </p>

<p>&#x201C;The safety of our customers and employees is always our top concern,&#x201D; MTA Chief Safety Officer David Mayer said. &#x201C;For obvious reasons, it is not safe to use hoverboards, skateboards or other personal wheeled vehicles on station platforms. We&#x2019;re equally concerned about the safety risk of bringing devices that pose fire hazards into the confined spaces inside trains and buses.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The MTA plans to promote the ban through a new advertising campaign using &quot;the now-famous &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072242/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/14/mta_etiquette_ads.php">bubble people</a>&apos;,&quot; according to the press release (we asked for a copy of this ad, but they don&apos;t have it yet).</p>
