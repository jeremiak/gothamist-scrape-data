<p>This week a photo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170222/http://gothamist.com/tags/jonhamm">Jon Hamm</a> hit the internet showing the actor leaving Barney&apos;s in New York with his girlfriend Jennifer Westfeldt. This isn&apos;t really a big deal, except that the photo circulating shows Hamm&apos;s man parts clearly defined through his trousers&#x2014;either that or he&apos;s smuggling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170222/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/18/alert_jon_hamm_is_eating_soup_on_th.php">some leftover matzo balls from Lansky&#x2019;s</a>. </p>

<p>What we&apos;re saying is, Hamm&apos;s ham is huge, IF the photo hasn&apos;t been altered. We want to believe, but what do you think: Has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170222/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen">the tv ad man</a> fallen &quot;victim&quot; to the world&apos;s most flattering, albeit subtle, Photoshop?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The consensus is that these photos are UNALTERED. There has actually been previous documentation (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170222/http://jonhammswang.tumblr.com/">a whole Tumblr</a>!) showing the prominent body part, and word has it that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170222/http://www.mamarazzi.org/2010/10/jon-hamm-likes-to-go-commando.html">Hamm likes to go commando</a>. But to be sure, we&apos;ve reached out to Hamm&apos;s publicist to see if we could schedule an in-person meeting with the actor to confirm.</p>
