<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121624/http://publicartfund.tumblr.com/post/12514743907/weve-combined-everything-we-love-public-art">Public Art Fund</a> has created a rendering of what could be the world&apos;s greatest public art project. Greatest work of art, even. They explain, &quot;We&apos;ve combined everything we love: public art, Ryan Gosling &amp; his dog, puppies, pizza, a baby cougar, and Hugh Jackman on a motorcycle.&quot; This is all eerily similar to dreams we&apos;ve had.</p>
