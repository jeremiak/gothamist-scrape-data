<p>&quot;To me, the commode is like a universe, and I can manipulate that universe just by flushing,&quot; a young Louis Szekely (better known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112603/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis CK</a>) told viewers of MTV&apos;s <em>Artumentary</em> in the 1990s. In the below video, he was going under the name &quot;David Cross&quot; and showing off his toilet art, in which he filled toilets with different color liquids and photographed them while they flushed into pieces of temporary and chaotic &quot;art.&quot; Though the whole thing is satirical, he does make a valid point that still holds true today: &quot;MTV will show you a lot of crap, and they&apos;ll tell you it&apos;s art.&quot;</p>
