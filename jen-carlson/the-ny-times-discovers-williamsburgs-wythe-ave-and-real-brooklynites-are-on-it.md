<p><em>For a critical response to the NY Times article titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231827/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/fashion/wythe-avenue-in-williamsburg-is-heating-up.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">All Roads Lead To Wythe Avenue</a>, we turned to Brooklyn native <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231827/http://www.twitter.com/sosoglos">Zach Staggers</a>, drummer of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231827/http://www.facebook.com/sosoglos">The So So Glos</a>, a band who have been immersed for many years in the city&apos;s DIY scene, which has deep roots in Williamsburg. Below is Staggers&apos; response to the article, which (if you didn&apos;t read it) includes lexical gems like: &quot;and when the sun crept below the jaw-dropping Manhattan skyline, it seemed to activate everyone&#x2019;s internal Instagram clock.&quot;</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="qutoebk0912.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231827im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/qutoebk0912.jpeg" width="290" height="291" class="image-right"> </span>In 1898 Brooklyn was incorporated into New York City. Before that it was on its own, Mayor and all. If Brooklyn didn&apos;t have a history, or was a newly developed city, then maybe this would all be tolerable.</p>

<p>The same way that a person who watches Fox News can tend to have a less than comprehensive knowledge of world affairs, a New York Times reader may now suffer a cognitive ailment not all that dissimilar. One believes Obama is a Muslim while the latter thinks the borough of Brooklyn to be a recently created utopia for hipsters and tourists alike&#x2014;a fantasy land that doubles as a zoo where people can party with, or gawk at bearded, tattooed DJs wearing ironic t-shirts and Ray-Ban sunglasses while chewing on $9 chocolate bars and drinking beer brewed in someone&#x2019;s bathtub.</p>

<p>The New York Times article, &quot;All Roads Lead to Wythe Avenue&quot;, is the paper&#x2019;s latest in a long line of Brooklyn trend pieces. But the Brooklyn the Times describes bears no familiarity to the Brooklyn I know from my childhood in Bay Ridge, or the &#x201C;hardworking Brooklyn&#x201D; my parents from Bensonhurst talk about. It&#x2019;s not even about the clich&#xE9;d pop-culture &quot;Crooklyn&quot; that was depicted in movies and on hip-hop albums throughout the eighties and nineties. Remember that version? The one which people sensed Brooklyn as Manhattan&#x2019;s dangerous, rough &amp; tough, down &amp; out younger cousin? This Brooklyn we&#x2019;re learning about now is a new brand of Brooklyn, centered around the Bedford L stop. It&#x2019;s totally gentrified, totally organic, totally artisan and totally irrelevant to the story of the borough thus far.</p>

<p>Brian Williams could not have said it better <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231827/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOxoCi4wCmI">when he joked</a> that The New York Times &#x201C;discovered&#x201D; Brooklyn. To be fair, there is merit to writing on the phenomenon that is Williamsburg. The small businesses that have recently sprouted up are not unlike my father&apos;s old bakery. They are much needed and they help Brooklyn keep an identity of its own at a time when Subway and Starbucks are finding their way into every crevasse in Kings County.</p>

<p>The problem is the notion that Williamsburg&apos;s culture of all things hip, artisan, and trendy represents all of Brooklyn. There&apos;s a whole &apos;nother borough south of Wythe Avenue that is still a place people settle, work, and raise families. Some are quick to forget about the rest of Brooklyn in lieu of this new, flash in the pan Brooklyn now used as a badge of authenticity. The borough where people were famous for &quot;tawking like this&quot; has gained a certain highbrow cultural value that attracts Manhattanites, tourists, and New York Times writers and readers alike. The culture of Brooklyn has been hijacked in a scheme that only the most genius PR person could conjure up.</p>

<p>The term, &quot;Tres Brooklyn&quot;, first published in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231827/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/04/world/europe/food-trucks-add-american-flavor-to-paris.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">a Times story</a> on food trucks in Paris, is a &quot;phrase so twee that it is now routinely mocked&quot; according to the Times. And for good reason. It&apos;s a fetishization, a warped idea of a Brooklyn that limits the borough&#x2019;s identity and erases its history. Among all of this Brooklyn branding as a destination for all things hip, Brooklyn&apos;s diverse culture is the victim.</p>

<p>So let&#x2019;s thank God (and large-scale rezoning) that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509231827/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/29/inside_wythe_hotel_roof_bar_the_ide.php#photo-1">the Wythe Hotel</a> has &quot;helped spiff up a once-desolate corner of Williamsburg.&quot; For years, I&#x2019;ve been holding my breath, waiting for the day that Bedford Avenue would become yesterday&apos;s news.</p>
