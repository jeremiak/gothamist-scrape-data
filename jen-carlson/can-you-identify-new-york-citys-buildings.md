</div></div>					<p>How many buildings in New York City&apos;s famous skyline can you identify? Click through the images to test yourself (answers at the end); the Illuminating Engineering Society of New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093023/http://www.iesnyc.org/NightSeeing.aspx">created this Nightseeing map</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093023/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/21/2010-07-21_map_to_citys_real_stars_nyers_find_it_tall_order_to_identify_skyscrapers.html">the Daily News</a> recently tested locals with it. Turns out their sample pool of New Yorkers didn&apos;t test any better than tourists! </p>

<p>One woman who has worked in the 75-story CitySpire building for three years couldn&apos;t even identify it on the map (in fact, she could only name 3 of the 26 buildings on the map)&#x2014;and one man standing in front of the Time Warner Center failed to name it on the map! How did <em>you</em> do?</p>
