<p>It&apos;s National Pi&#xF1;a Colada Day, and if we&apos;re going to celebrate fake holidays, they might as well be ones that make us suck down trashy frozen cocktails. If you feel like celebrating, or just haven&apos;t felt that burn of brainfreeze recently, we&apos;ve got some suggestions on where you can go.</p>

<p><strong>DALLAS BBQ</strong> Hit up one of the many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034842/http://dallasbbq.com/">Dallas BBQ</a> joints around the city&#x2014;these guys really perfect the art of the trashy frozen drink, don&apos;t they? They aren&apos;t afraid to just <em>go there</em> with the test tube shot, either. Plus you can Texas size your boozy beverages for just $7.99. One Gothamist staffer says, &quot;I LOVE a Miami Vice, with the extra shot for $1.&quot; For those not in the know (congratulations, by the way), that&apos;s a  half Daiquiri half Pi&#xF1;a.</p>

<p><em>Dallas BBQ is located... everywhere, basically. Just keep turning corners til you find one.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034842/http://brooklynsurfbar.com/">SURF BAR</a></strong> This place has a bevy of boozy beverages, including the Pi&#xF1;a. It may not be &quot;the best,&quot; but it <em>is</em> served in a hula girl plastic cup and there <em>is</em> sand on the ground at this place&#x2014;and that&apos;s something. Plus, our own John Del Signore (pictured) runs off these things, and has them delivered in dry ice to the office every Friday, with a side of paper cocktail umbrellas.</p>

<p><em>Surf Bar is located at 139 North 6th Street in Williamsburg</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034842/http://pk-ny.com/"><strong>PKNY</strong></a> pours a generous Pi&#xF1;a that at least one Yelper declared to be her &quot;fav&quot;! Last we heard they were served in hollowed-out pineapple shells, which is always the most desirable mode of transport for delivering the slushy drink to your mouth hole.</p>

<p><em>PKNY is located at 49 Essex Street on the Lower East Side</em></p>
