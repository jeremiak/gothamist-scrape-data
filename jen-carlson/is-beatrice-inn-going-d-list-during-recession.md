This recession thing is really real now, people. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420214338/http://www.observer.com/2009/media/sign-times-regulars-bemoan-newly-lax-door-policy-beatrice">The Observer</a> is reporting that the Beatrice Inn has been forced to let in out-of-town no-names because they allegedly need their dirty hard-earned bridge and tunnel money...<em>or do they</em>? The West Village bar is famously run by Chlo&#xEB; Sevigny&apos;s brother Paul, and on top of a strict door policy it boasts a hefty regulars list of the young, beautiful and bold-faced. But now the patrons have noticed they&apos;re letting just about anyone in these days.</p><blockquote>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just a totally different crowd now,&#x201D; said a 22-year-old model, who until recently was a regular at the bar. <strong>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen the doorman let in Jersey trash&#x2014;girls dressed in like H&amp;M; and Forever 21&#x2014;sleazy guys looking to pick up underage girls, Gossip Girl wannabes, and like C-list celebrities,&#x201D;</strong> the model continued. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just not the same. People stagger up and ask for autographs and they take photos with cell phone cameras. Before, anyone who would be doing that would never be allowed in. It&#x2019;s going the way of other clubs like Bungalow 8.&#x201D;</blockquote>One regular had a more upbeat outlook, however, saying that the usual crowd is simply too cold to leave their lofty lairs at the moment (or maybe they&apos;re in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420214338/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/15/beatrice_inn_classing_up_atlantic_c.php">Atlantic City</a>?). Meanwhile, Mr. Sevigny assured the paper, &quot;If anything, the Beatrice&#x2019;s door policy has gotten tighter, not looser. We don&#x2019;t make a ton of money, but we do pride ourselves on having one of the toughest door policies in New York City. I guarantee you we will be the last to sell out.&#x201D; Sorry, Jersey (or anyone not approximately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420214338/http://www.flickr.com/photos/96026681@N00/2297590193/"><em>this</em> cool</a>), take your pedestrian names and synthetic poly-blends back from whence they came!<p></p>
