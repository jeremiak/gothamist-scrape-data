<p>In February <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101938/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/kurt_cobain_1.php#photo-1">we revisited the studio</a> where Nirvana recorded &quot;In Utero&quot; on the day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101938/http://gothamist.com/tags/kurtcobain">Kurt Cobain</a> would have been turning 45 years old, had he not turned a gun on himself 18 years ago. Today.</p>

<p>On this anniversary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101938/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/john_norris_on_finding_out_kurt_cob.php">last year</a> we asked former MTV veejay John Norris where he was when he learned of Cobain&apos;s death (most people likely heard of it first via MTV News, after all). He told us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;As un-rock n roll as it sounds, I was standing in Charivari, a one-time super trendy clothing store on West 57th Street, buying a suit for some upcoming event. This being the pre-mobile phone era, MTV called the store and asked to put me on the phone. They let me know the sickening, but sadly, somehow not entirely unbelievable news. I was back at the studio within fifteen minutes, where we put together several hours of programming, Kurt Loder conducting interviews (including David Fricke who famously called Cobain the &quot;John Lennon of his generation&quot;), while I talked music and intro&apos;d music videos. It is to this day, one of the moments at MTV about which I get asked the most.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101938/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/15/in_defense_of_courtney_love_who_is.php">Courtney Love</a> read parts of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101938/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/00/Kurt%27sNote.jpg">Cobain&apos;s suicide note</a> to his fans:</p>

<p>Adding to the tragedy, recently news came out that Tom Cruise might be playing a Kurt Cobain-esque character&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101938/http://www.vulture.com/2012/04/tom-cruise-could-basically-play-kurt-cobain-in-clint-eastwood-film.html">Vulture</a> reported, &quot;the male lead is basically Kurt Cobain, if he &apos;never got to go <em>Unplugged</em> and survived and it&#x2019;s 20 years later and it&#x2019;s now, and he wanted to try to do that album with that understanding as this grunge icon ... In a world of Justin Bieber, if you&#x2019;re Kurt Cobain now in your 50s, what do you do? How do you exist in this world?&apos;&quot; Let&apos;s wash that out of our brains with a little &quot;Lithium&quot;:</p>

<p>Here in New York, you can revisit Cobain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101938/https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/set/default.aspx?setID=1992">at the Morrison Hotel Gallery</a> (at 116 Prince Street), where they have photos of the musician by Jesse Frohman. It opens today.</p>
