<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170006/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/03/video_of_the_da_146.php">Late night television is back</a>, with two hosts not crossing the picket line (David Letterman and Craig Ferguson), and three still getting WGA picketers outside of their studios (Conan O&apos;Brien, Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel). Only two hosts were willing to grow, and keep, their strike beards -- and we want to know whose you like best! </p>

<p>We added a Photoshop-bearded Leno (because we wanted to know what it would look like), so your voting options will include him. </p>

<p>Amazingly, without a beard or writers, Leno still topped Letterman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170006/http://tvdecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/even-without-writers-leno-tops-letterman/?hp">in ratings</a>.  </p>
