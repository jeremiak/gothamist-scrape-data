<span class="photo_caption">Hunter back in New York in 1988, on Letterman</span>

<p>Earlier today my pitch to live 24 hours like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021628/http://gothamist.com/tags/huntersthompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> was killed on account of not being able to procure enough cocaine by 3:45 p.m., the time that Thompson would start to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021628/http://www.openculture.com/2013/08/hunter-s-thompsons-harrowing-chemical-fueled-daily-routine.html">binge on the stuff</a>. Also: lawyers, waivers, etc. </p>

<p>So here I am devouring Just Mango Slices (from Trader Joe&apos;s, good stuff!), trying to generate content <em>soberly</em>. Not even a drop of Chivas or puff off a Dunhills. <em>I haven&apos;t even cursed yet today.</em> So what to do? Something very un-Hunter S. Thompson like... a list of things that aren&apos;t drugs, including photos of nearly every apartment building the writer rested his buzzed-out head at in Manhattan. We would include a list of &quot;fun facts&quot; but it goes without saying the good Doctor hated &quot;fun facts.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021628/http://www.cromwell-intl.com/travel/usa/ny-hunter-s-thompson.html">These addresses</a> come from letters he sent (published in <em>The Proud Highway: Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman</em>), and some of the apartments were likely crash pads or shared with a roommate. All still seem to be around today, so maybe you live in one? Maybe that <em>isn&apos;t</em> Borax piled behind your fridge, maybe it&apos;s vintage cocaine! Don&apos;t test that theory out!</p>
