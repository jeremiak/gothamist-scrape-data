<p>You know what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140218234611/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/video_take_a_4-minute_drive_through.php">East Village of the 1980s</a> was missing? A nice botanical healing den to just chill the eff out in. Everything would have been so much more relaxing had there been a little nook where everyone could just smoke their natural calming herbs while sipping caffeine-free tea brews. </p>

<p>The Vape Lounge is now open in the cellar of Barbiere at 246 East 5th Street, and their website proclaims they are a Botanical Healing Den, complete with a &quot;Hippy Hour&quot; that lasts from 2 to 4:20. What is this, California? But they&apos;re not offering pot (probably), they&apos;re offering &quot;medicinal herbs [that will] take you to another place.&quot; Like anywhere else. Anywhere but there.</p>

<p>Currently they offer three different herbs to vape&#x2014;Chamomile, for relaxing; Damiana, an aphrodisiac for when things get weird during Hippy Hour; and Green Tea, for detoxification. Prices are $10/person in the &quot;plenty lounge&quot; and $12/person in the Volcano Bar. You can find more at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140218234611/http://www.comevape.com/Comevape/Welcome_1.html">their excellent website</a> which someone definitely designed after vaping too much of the off-menu herb.</p>

<p>This is what happens when you protest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140218234611/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/14/union_square_locals_haunted_by_the.php">IHOP</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140218234611/http://gothamist.com/tags/7-11">7-11</a> opening in the neighborhood.
