<p>&quot;Has Billburg Lost Its Cool?&quot; That was the title of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821045531/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/nyregion/has-billburg-lost-its-cool.html?pagewanted=3">NY Times article</a> published on July 27th, 2003. Below are quotes from the article, presented without context and in chronological order.</p><ul><li>He listens to Electroclash music, has 40-plus pals on Friendster and creates art with discarded household paint under the moniker Scooter.<br>
</li><li>He explored the cafe society of Bedford Avenue... by day, he shared war stories with other hardscrabble artists over chai and iBooks.<br>
</li><li>Then the edginess started to dull. &quot;It&apos;s a cool spot... But you know what? It started to get too cool.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;All the hipsters were dressing the same way. Sideways trucker caps, tight T-shirts, vintage jeans and Converse high-tops for guys. And for girls: very 80&apos;s studded belts, off-the-shoulder shirts, leg warmers and asymmetrical haircuts.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Plenty of hipsters are still ardent Williamsburgers and would never live anywhere else. And many of them are skeptical about any hipster exodus from Brooklyn to Manhattan. &quot;I don&apos;t know who made up this story,&quot; said Fabio Roberti, a partner of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821045531/http://www.soapcherie.com/">Earwax Records</a>. <br>
</li><li>But after the nth visit, at least for some, the ebony reflecting pool at Galapagos lost its novel sheen.<br>
</li><li>Williamsburg struck him as more like a third-world country.<br>
</li><li>Amenities that Williamsburg lacks: Korean delis, an actual bank.<br>
</li><li>&quot;The so-called hipsterati are very proud to be here,&apos;&apos; said Jason Jeffries, the founder of a community Web site called Billburg.com, &quot;The beauty of the neighborhood comes from the inside out.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Everyone is trying so hard to be different.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;I&apos;m tired of Williamsburg.&quot;<br>
</li><li>&quot;Everybody looks like they stepped out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821045531/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/04/pain_has_a_face_urban_outfitters_wi_1.php">Urban Outfitters</a>, times a thousand.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Ms. Libbey is moving next month from a converted warehouse on Kent Avenue to a one-bedroom in Midtown.<br>
</li><li>&quot;Outside of New York, Williamsburg is still spoken of constantly as the hipsters&apos; place, which will probably make New Yorkers disdain it more.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Some are even declaring the Williamsburg scene officially over.</li></ul><p></p>
