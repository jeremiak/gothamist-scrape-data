										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:350px; "> <img alt="alloh0911.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151446im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/alloh0911.jpg" width="350" height="234"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Ali Lohan</span></i></div> The Lohan clan is sticking up for youngest daughter Ali, who recently showed off her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151446/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/09/photo_ali_lohan_has_never_had_plast.php">shocking new look</a> consisting of skin, bones, and botox. Though her modeling rep says, &quot;Aliana has never had any type of plastic surgery in her life, nor has she ever considered it. Her success as a model lies with her natural looks and she has no interest in changing that. <strong>During the past two years, she has gone through a normal teenage growth spurt that has made her taller and slimmer. It has also slightly changed the composure of her face</strong>, all of which is typical of what happens to kids in their mid to late teens. It&#x2019;s what most people refer to as the awkward stage. Ali is growing up, that&#x2019;s all.&quot; Yeah, <em>totally normal</em>.<p></p>

<p>Mama bear Dina also insists the new look is all part of growing up, and she&apos;s not at all concerned that her daughter reportedly weighs only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151446/http://scoop.today.com/_news/2011/09/08/7670055-ali-lohans-drastic-new-look">95 lbs</a>. According to someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151446/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/09/ali-lohan-weight-loss-mom-dina-not-concerned">Radar</a> talked to, &quot;Lindsay feels that people are just jealous of the Lohans and only want to focus on negative aspects of their lives.&quot; LiLo also insisted &quot;every runway model is just as thin!&quot;</p>

<p>More bad news for the little Lohan: &quot;Lindsay is giving Ali career advice.&quot; It&apos;s unclear if that advice had anything to do with the 17-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151446/http://crushable.com/entertainment/17-year-old-ali-lohan-models-in-lingerie-503/gallery-page/1/">modeling lingerie</a>.</p>
