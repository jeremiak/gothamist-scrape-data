The suit was filed last week and they&apos;re seeking &quot;a permanent injunction, the destruction of all infringing products and damages of no less than $750,000 for each infringement.&quot; Destroy the Batmobile? Impossible!</p>

It took just three weeks to design and build, and designer George Barris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161435/http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/trickedout-batmobile-was-really-a-ford-20110426-1duz4.html#ixzz1M9BnnmQU">recently criticized</a> newer versions.
