<p>When you see a rat scurry across the sidewalk, you are seeing a Rodent of Normal Size, but as we learned from <em>The Princess Bride</em> there are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128093841/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/giant_rat.php">Rodents of Unusual Sizes</a> out there. Watching. Lurking. Eyeing your dogs. Waiting...</p>

<p>You should save your shrieks and 311 calls for them. </p>

<p>They are the ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128093841/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/nyregion/new-york-city-escalates-the-war-on-rats-once-again.html">you hear in the bushes</a> but never see.</p>

<p>They are The Watchers of the vermin world. </p>

<p>They may one day be our overlords, but not until they figure out how to avoid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128093841/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/brooklyn_man_stabs_giant_rat_with_p.php">the sharp end of a pitchfork</a>. </p>

<p>The latest sighting of an ROUS here in New York City comes from Park Slope&apos;s Washington Park, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128093841/https://instagram.com/p/42-fZrTgDh/?taken-by=marcirobin">Marci Robin</a> witnessed a gleeful Parks Employee fish out this giant dead rat that a local dog had sniffed out. She told us more about the scene this morning: </p>

<blockquote>It was taken in the dog run at Washington Park in Park Slope. The park is adjacent to a middle school with a bunch of dumpsters, so the dog owners are accustomed to hearing rats scurry along the side of the run as it&apos;s getting dark. But my next-door neighbor&apos;s pit bull, Bianca, kept intently barking at the far corner of the run yesterday evening; we thought it might be at the kids in the skate park section. 

<p>Next thing we knew, the park employee pictured showed up and said someone called him about a huge rat in the dog run. None of the people in the run took credit for the call, but we went to see if that&apos;s what Bianca was so worked up about. Lo and behold, there was Templeton after singing &quot;A Fair is a Veritable Smorgasbord,&quot; except, you know, dead. The park employee picked it up with one of those Billy Mays Deluxe Gopher thingies, and made him do a few dance moves along with some pretty solid ventriloquism.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Sadly, there is no video of this vaudeville act, but footage of the Parks Employee earlier that day has surfaced: </p>
