<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192511/http://gothamist.com/tags/googamooga">Great GoogaMooga</a> came to Brooklyn&apos;s Prospect Park two years ago, bringing with it food, alcohol, bands, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192511/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/googamooga.php">promises</a>, and thousands of feet trampling the grass. Following this year&apos;s rainy run at the park, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192511/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/22/great_googa_mooga.php#photo-1">damaged grass</a> needed to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192511/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/grass_damaged_during_googamooga_wil.php">reseeded</a>, and locals complained about the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192511/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/18/ny_times_film_critic_still_hates_go.php">branded shitshow</a>&quot; taking over their precious parkland. And it looks like they just won the park (which had been receiving about $75,000 to host the event) back.</p>

<p>According to a Parks Department official, the event won&apos;t happen in that park again. NYC Park Advocates&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192511/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2013/10/googa-mooga-not-returning-to-prospect.html">Geoffrey Croft notes</a> that &quot;the news was revealed this afternoon, ironically by Michael Bloomberg family friend Besty Smith, head of revenue and marketing for the Parks Department at a City Council oversight hearing entitled, The Private Use of Public Parkland: Do Large Scale Events Benefit Parks.&quot;</p>

<p>Smith says they&apos;re looking for another location.</p>
