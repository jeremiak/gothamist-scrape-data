<p>Opening this Saturday and running through next August at the American Museum of Natural History, it&apos;s: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520154629/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/climatechange/?src=h_h">Climate Change, The Threat to Life and A New Energy Future</a>! Uplifting, no? The exhibit &quot;will examine one of the most pressing scientific issues of our time&#x2014;the massive, human-induced warming of Earth, a phenomenon that could lead to drought, rising sea levels, heavy storms, and other events with potentially dire impacts on the health of society and the natural world.&quot;</p>

<p>Spoiler Alert? New York City isn&apos;t invincible, and one activity will let visitors &quot;investigate raising the sea levels on a dynamic scale model of Lower Manhattan to graphically illustrate the flooding that would be caused by the melting of ice sheets and warming of oceans.&quot; Curator and Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520154629/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10152008/news/regionalnews/deep_look_into_future_133704.htm">the NY Post</a> that &quot;The scenario of a flooded Manhattan is unlikely to ever occur...because the city would have ample time to build higher seawalls and pumping systems.&quot; But let&apos;s not get to that point, &apos;kay?</p>
