<p>There was a magical time in New York City&apos;s recent past when Ryan Gosling would show up every other week or so to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151146/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/22/video_ryan_gosling_breaks_up_nyc_st.php">stop an art caper</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151146/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/03/ryan_gosling_just_saved_someone_fro.php">save a woman&apos;s life</a>, but lately to get our &quot;not all good looking celebrities are dicks&quot; fix, we&apos;ve been left to search YouTube for videos of whatever Andrew Garfield has been doing during his downtime on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151146/http://gothamist.com/tags/spiderman"><em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</em></a> set. </p>

<p>In May <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151146/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/video_spider-man_takes_break_from_f.php">he played basketball</a> with some kids <em>while wearing his Spider-man costume</em>. And this past weekend he held a wittle baaaabyyyy in Madison Square Park. A baby who will now be now suffer through life traumatized and confused having seen Spider-man without his mask on at such a young age.</p>

<p>Did you can catch the moment where the baby&apos;s mom contemplates leaving her husband for a new life with the star?
