According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231070002/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/11/2010-05-11_thats_no_kitten_its_furry_fangs_sues_petco_after_feline_attacks.html">the Daily News</a>, Costa adopted <em>two</em> cats from Petco&apos;s Union Square shop in 2007, with her then-fianc&#xE9;. She was told the long-haired tabby she wanted came as a package deal with a short-haired brother, so she adopted them both, named them Harry and Sally, and took her new feline family home. But Harry spent weeks hiding under her bed, and when he finally emerged, he took a bite out of her middle finger.</p>

<p>Costa had surgery, was hospitalized for three days, and allegedly couldn&apos;t work for six months. She claims she is still unable to use her hand like she used to, and has now sworn off cats. Her lawsuit accuses Petco and Kittykind of negligence for mislabeling the felines as domestic&#x2014;she says they were feral and &quot;unadoptable.&quot; Her lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231070002/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queens_woman_sues_petco_over_feral_13U57K51a2sHVIFh0W9gnN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">also calls</a> Harry &quot;a wild animal with claws.&quot;</p>

<p>Before judging someone for suing a cat rescue service... never forget: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231070002/http://www.pet-abuse.com/cases/4622/NJ/US/">200 cat corpses</a>. <em>On the other hand</em>, who <em>hasn&apos;t</em> been bit by a cat?</p>
