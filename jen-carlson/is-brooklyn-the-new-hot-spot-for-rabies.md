										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="angryraccoon1210.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211024im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/angryraccoon1210.jpg" width="200" height="226" class="image-left"> </span>Last Thursday a dead raccoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211024/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/07/rabid_raccoon_found_dead_in_prospec.php">was found in Prospect Park</a>, and soon after tested positive for rabies. Since then, locals have been criticizing the park for not testing other dead animals in the past&#x2014;as is standard procedure in Central Park (where 120 raccoons tested positive this year, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211024/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/16/rabid_raccoons.php">vaccination program</a> was established). Some claim clean up crews stall on picking up reported dead animals, leaving them to believe the city is part of the problem... and we are all <em>seconds</em> away from a rabid zombie-animal takeover.</p>

<p>Park advocates say that animal corpses are eventually dumped in with the trash, but officials say when the animals are not badly decomposed they are sent to the Department of Health for testing. There have been <em>a lot</em> of dead animals in that park this year, and as of now the city isn&apos;t saying how many they&apos;ve tested.</p>

<p>Health officials now vow to &quot;conduct enhanced rabies surveillance,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211024/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/50/dtg_rabidraccoon_2010_12_10_bk.html">the Brooklyn Paper</a>. But wildlife rehabilitator Anne-Katrin Titze says, <strong>&quot;There is already an outbreak of raccoon rabies in Central Park&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s clearly moving.&#x201D;</strong> Let&apos;s get on this DoH, the last thing we need is frothing, rabid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211024/http://gothamist.com/tags/canadageese">Canada geese</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211024/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/saber_tooth_tigers.php">saber-toothed tigers</a> roaming around.</p>
