<p>A group of college kids found a giant head without a body in the Hudson River <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405235506/http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1cwbw1/marist_rowing_team_found_a_head_in_the_hudson/">earlier this week</a>, which sort of sounds like the beginning of some <em>Stand By Me</em>-esque tale... except the head was made of styrofoam and fiberglass and not flesh and brains.</p>

<p>The head was found by members of the Marist College crew team, and the college&apos;s spokesman says, &quot;Everybody is wondering where it came from, who it belongs to. We were hoping that through [media] exposure, it would help us get to the bottom of this. I&apos;d think if someone knew it was missing, they&apos;d go looking for it... I&apos;m dumbfounded.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>ATTN: ANYONE MISSING A GIANT HEAD?</strong> </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405235506/http://newyork.newsday.com/news/region-state/hudson-river-giant-head-has-marist-dumbfounded-1.5133586">Newsday</a>, the head was &quot;found bobbing in the river just after sunrise Tuesday. It took about 10 rowers to haul the waterlogged head from the river near the Poughkeepsie college&apos;s boat dock.&quot; The super sharp Marist officials &quot;believe the head was a decoration, perhaps a stage prop.&quot;</p>

<p>At least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405235506/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/04/floating-7-foot-head-leaves-rowers-scratching-theirs/">one person believes</a> it traveled from New Orleans, noting, &quot;The second I saw that head I thought: Mardi Gras float. Many of the floats have Greek themes, and the Gulf Stream ocean current goes north along the East Coast.&quot; Others give it a much more local origin, like the Bardavon 1869 Opera House in Poughkeepsie. We may never solve this mystery, but at least it&apos;s not another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405235506/http://gothamist.com/tags/montaukmonster">Montauk or East River MONSTER</a>.</p>
