<p>The summer before I went to college, I started dating this guy&#x2014;we&apos;ll call him Brad, because that is his name. Brad played soccer for my high school&apos;s biggest rival. I forget how I met him. </p>

<p>We dated that entire summer, which at 17 years old feels like an eternity. Our routine was simple: once I finished up at my summer job, I would usually see Brad. We&apos;d go cliff jumping, or watch the World Cup games, or sit around his house, smoke pot and make out. Sometimes at night we&apos;d go drink beer in a pick-up truck in an empty parking lot up by a factory in his town. Once we jumped a fence to a medical supply place and stole a tank of nitrous. He called me &quot;kid&quot; a lot, which I somehow found endearing. One time we went cliff jumping <em>at night</em> and afterwards fell asleep in the woods. I woke up with 1,000 mosquito bites.</p>

<p>That September, I went off to college. We hadn&apos;t discussed our plans, but Brad was a year younger than me and would only be two hours away. We&apos;d figure it out. I arrived on campus, and my roommate, who I hadn&apos;t met yet, was a girl named Kelly, who happened to be from Brad&apos;s town. I looked over at the wall, where she had hung up some photos on a corkboard, and there was Brad, next to some cute girl. At prom, maybe.</p>

<p>&quot;You know my boyfriend Brad?!&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Brad is my best friend Christina&apos;s boyfriend!&quot; she answered. </p>

<p>Valentine&apos;s Day is bullshit, and if some asshole gave me a cockroach I would name it BRAD, before dumping him. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127140432/http://bronxzoo.com/roach">What would you name your cockroach</a>?</p>
