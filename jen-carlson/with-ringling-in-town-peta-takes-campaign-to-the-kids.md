Circus</a> sets up shop starting tomorrow. Their plan was to school the children in circus cruelty, handing out stickers and coloring books that declared, &quot;Circuses are no fun for animals.&quot; While this may be true, many are criticizing the organization for their tactics, saying their method is inappropriate&#x2014;a psychologist noted that the children &quot;might go home and be very anxious&quot; because they &quot;are less mature in their cognitive process.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083305/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/03/ellie_elephant.php">One PETA member</a> was dressed as an elephant with its arm in a sling, handing out the coloring book that included a cartoon that read: &quot;Elephants are trained or punished with sharp pointed hooks or whips. These giant creatures have sensitive skin and feel great pain from this treatment.&quot; What&apos;s next, telling them that Santa&apos;s reindeer are being mistreated? However, at least one 9-year-old girl decided she would &quot;not want to see any animal beaten for not doing the right thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ringling Bros. reps maintain that their animals are &quot;healthy and well cared for by a team of full-time veterinarians and an animal care staff that works to ensure that the animals have an enriching and safe environment.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083305/http://hsus.typepad.com/wayne/2009/02/ringling-trial.html">Read</a> president of the HSUS&apos;s blog addressing a recent lawsuit with charges made against Ringling for their routine handling practices of elephants that include the use of bullhooks, chaining, and confinement that violates the Endangered Species Act.</p>
