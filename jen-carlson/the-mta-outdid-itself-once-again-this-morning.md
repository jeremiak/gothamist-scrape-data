title: The MTA Outdid Itself Once Again This Morning

<p>It&apos;s Tuesday morning in New York City, one of the most modern urban metropolises on earth, though you wouldn&apos;t know it from our busted old raggedly syphilitic mass transit system. Once again this morning subway service on multiple lines ground to a halt as the system suffered delays due to our old friend &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122154/http://gothamist.com/tags/signalproblems">signal problems</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>The uptown B, D, F and M lines started seeing delays just before the big rush, around 6:30 a.m., with the B and D completely shutting down before being rerouted. There was allegedly a brief reprieve before signal problems struck again around 8 a.m. At this point the MTA was warning there would be &quot;extensive delays,&quot; and announcements listing off the troubled lines lasted <em>minutes</em> in subway stations. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122154/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Signal-Problems-Service-Changes-Mucks-Up-Morning-Commute-for-Thousands-B-D-F-M-N-Q-R-Lines-429618593.html">NBC New York</a>, some &quot;frustrated customers had to transfer to trains only to be told they had to transfer yet again.&quot; The news station added that around 8:15 a.m. even more signal problems were reported, with the B line suspending service in some areas, and &quot;northbound D and F trains rerouted on the C and E lines.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how that breaks down for the humans depending on those trains: Gothamist&apos;s John Del Signore started out on the M, which turned into a J at Delancey, where everyone went over to the F, which was &quot;mad crowded and just sitting there.&quot; Riders on the F were warned it would be turning into an A. In a futile search for sympathy, Del Signore started transmitting his commuting woes to the home office around 7:50 a.m. At some point he gave up on the stalled F train at Delancey and went in search of an R train. As of 9:10 a.m. he has still not made it into the office. Godspeed, man. </p>

<p>To recap, these trains were fucked this morning: 4, 5, 6, A, C, E, B, D, F, M, and L. And it appears <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122154/https://twitter.com/grglewis/status/877147843781435392">the 2 had troubles</a>, as well.</p>

<p>But at least the WiFi service is pretty good down there, which means you can tweet your frustrations at the MTA and eventually we&apos;ll get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122154/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/19/reduced_lirr_fares.php">reduced fares</a>, right?</p>
