Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103513/http://pentagram.com/en/partners/paula-scher.php">Paula Scher</a>&apos;s exhibit of painted city maps opened at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103513/http://www.mayastendhalgallery.com/p_scher-rp-page.html">Maya Stendhal Gallery</a> (running through January 26th). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103513/http://www.pentagram.com/">Pentagram</a> design firm partner has created the looks of the Public Theater, the Metropolitan Opera, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Symphony Space, the High Line, the Asia Society (and more) through logos. 

</p><p>This exhibit expands on her Maps series which took over the gallery last year, and depicts &quot;entire continents, countries and cities from all over the world that have been the critical focus of attention in recent headlines.&quot;</p>

<p>For more Paula Scher work, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103513/http://gothamist.com/2004/04/07/alternate_nyc_olympic_bid_logo.php">check out</a> the Olympic-bid logos she designed in 2004 and <em>Jon Stewart&apos;s America: The Book</em> (which she designed).</p>
