<p>Hillary Clinton may have been mocked for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016070541/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/hillary_subwayghazi.php">mis-swiping her MetroCard</a>, but no New Yorker, not even the most native among us, has a .400 swiping record&#x2014;there is no Ted Williams of swiping. Embrace our commonality in this.<br>
 <br>
Just as we&apos;ve all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016070541/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/21/never_stop_for_coffee_on_the_way.php"><em>juuuuust</em> missed getting on the subway train</a>, we&apos;ve also all taken a swipe and been nailed in the crotch by the unrelenting turnstile bar. &quot;Swipe card again at this turnstile,&quot; the screen demands. &quot;Insufficient fare,&quot; it shames. What happens in the next few seconds is crucial, as a series of failed swipes could very well break you. If you are met with success on swipe two, all is good. If you enter the 3+ swipe territory, you will feel one of the following emotions, as provided by the Gothamist staff:</p>

<p><strong>Jen Carlson:</strong> What is your main emotion when you have to swipe your MetroCard 3+ times? Shame, Frustration, Anger, Hopelessness, Other</p>

<p><strong>Jessica Leibowitz:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016070541/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W79N7ph5r9A">stupid stupid</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Miranda Katz:</strong> Anger but as if it&#x2019;s someone else&#x2019;s fault.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Yakas:</strong> Fear. I don&apos;t want anyone to think I&apos;m a tourist/don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing.</p>

<p><strong>John Del Signore:</strong> Minor forgettable annoyance.</p>

<p><strong>Jake Dobkin:</strong> I worry that this whole sham of being a cool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016070541/http://gothamist.com/tags/askanativenewyorker">native New Yorker</a> has just come crashing down around me and now everyone knows the truth.</p>

<p><strong>Nathan Tempey:</strong> I worry about getting rear-ended.</p>

<p><strong>Emma Whitford:</strong> Anxiety that I&#x2019;m holding people up who are behind me.</p>

<p><strong>Rebecca Fishbein:</strong> Yeah that one! Definite shame.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Yakas:</strong> You can&apos;t copy someone&apos;s emotional response, come up with your own.</p>

<p>In the above video (filmed at five Manhattan subway stations) what we mostly see is hopelessness, infused with a little frustration, and very few victory swipes. Also, some fairly stylish turnstile jumping.</p>

<p>N.B.: The MTA recently declared the speed, in miles per hour, of a proper MetroCard swipe: &quot;a speed of 10 to 40 inches per second (i.p.s.) is the valid range for MetroCard acceptance by the Swipe Reader/Writer (SRW) device of our turnstile.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016070541/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-speed-of-a-metrocard-swipe.html">The NY Times</a> translated this: &quot;Ten inches per second is 0.57 m.p.h.; forty i.p.s. is 2.27 m.p.h.&quot; This information will likely help no one, so the struggle continues.</p>
