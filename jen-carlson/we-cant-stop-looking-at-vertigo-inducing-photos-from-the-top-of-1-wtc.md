<p>When the final part of the spire was lifted and installed on to the top of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105341/http://gothamist.com/tags/1wtc">One World Trade Center</a>, the Port Authority attached a camera to the bottom&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105341/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/14/insane_vertigo-inducing_video_from.php">remember this video</a>, delivering 9 full minutes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105341/http://gothamist.com/tags/vertigo">vertigo</a> that&apos;s still making our palms sweat? Anyway, around that time they ALSO took some other photos... FROM ABOVE, like this one.</p>

<p>We recommend you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105341/https://twitter.com/WTCProgress/status/337960970439782401/photo/1">view it in full size</a> to get the real nauseating, sweating, vertigo experience. They Tweeted the pic out yesterday, noting the brave men in this photo are ironworkers installing the final sections earlier this month&#x2014;&quot;Working above 1,700 feet in the air!&quot;</p>
