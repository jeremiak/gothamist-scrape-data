The airline says he was threatened with arrest by customs officials, but customs denies the allegation.</p>

<p>Passengers were kept on the plane because there was only one customs official at Bradley international Airport <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164711/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/23/newark_4.php">on Tuesday night</a>, and the captain was told the passengers needed to stay put until more immigration officials arrived&#x2014;which took hours. Passengers are hoping that the U.S. Transportation Department officials listen to audio recordings between pilots and customs officials to clarify what happened. </p>

<p>Founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164711/http://Flyersrights.org/">Flyersrights.org</a>, Kate Hanni, says the Transportation Department should be including Customs and Border Patrol and the TSA in  regulations related to tarmac strandings, noting, &quot;They appear to be a roadblock. Often airlines tell us customs or TSA refused to allow passengers off planes.&quot;</p>

<p>This week&apos;s incident is still under investigation; passengers finally arrived at their destination of Newark, NJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505164711/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/24/virgin_passengers_finally_make_it_t.php">yesterday</a>.</p>
