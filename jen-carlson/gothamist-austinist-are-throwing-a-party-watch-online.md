Austinist &amp; Gothamist are proud to announce our day party, taking place on Wednesday, March 12 at the Mohawk (912 Red River, Austin).  The party kicks off around 11 a.m., and the day ends at 6 p.m., but not before <strong>Shout Out Louds, Shearwater, Liam Finn and Phosphorescent</strong> perform. </p>

<p>This year, we&apos;ll be joined by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054751/http://daytrotter.com/">Daytrotter</a>, who (for those in New York) will be <strong>streaming some of the performances live on the web</strong>. We&apos;ll also be joined by <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054751/http://flickr.com/photos/austinist/sets/72157603033391436/">Annie Ray</a></strong> who will be working hard in her photo booth as well. As usual, the party is free, open to all...</p>
