<p>The announcement was to be timed around an NBC presentation at 30 Rock &quot;that&apos;s taking the place of NBC&apos;s traditional upfront,&quot; however &quot;timing of the announcement may now be in flux&quot; since Fox News and the NY Times had already spilled the beans. When it is announced, and the moves are made, Conan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170411075004/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i893a6fe1c07f68041bf50672f9efbc66?imw=Y">will likely land</a> at LA&apos;s Universal Studios&apos; Stage One, with Fallon at New York&apos;s studio 6A. </p>

<p>Conan will be taking off six months between hosting duties, and it&apos;s expected that Fallon will be back on the small screen in February 2009; giving him plenty of time to put his show together. </p>
