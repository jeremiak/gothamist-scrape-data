<p>Meet Jamie Casino, a personal injury lawyer and metal fan from Georgia who purchased a two-minute block of local advertising during the Super Bowl to air this amazing commercial. Which is <em>actually</em> amazing, not just Internet Headline Amazing. Casino plays himself, an unlikely hero who has successfully transitioned from $cumbag Lawyer to Good Guy following his brother&apos;s death (&quot;I wasn&apos;t always a personal injury lawyer, I once was a notorious criminal defense lawyer who was employed by some of the most cold-hearted villains.&quot;). Get some popcorn and allow his origin story to drive a fiery stake through your tender heart and soul:</p>

<p>The ad comes on the heels of one he released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020426/http://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/hilarious-commercial-alert-attorney-smashes-insurance-companies-with-a-hammer/">earlier this year</a>, and it&apos;s all based on a true story: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020426/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr2gdPY-88w#t=0">The spot</a> features Jamie&apos;s brother Michael who was gunned down with his friend on Labor Day 2012. The story reveals how Savannah&apos;s Chief of Police, Willie Lovett, deceived the citizens of Savannah after four homicides took place Labor Day weekend. Jamie Casino, a personal injury attorney with a large practice based in Savannah, GA created the ad to set the record straight in the Biggest Game of the Year, Super Bowl XLVIII.&quot; </p>
