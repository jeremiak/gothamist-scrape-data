<p>Earlier this week it came as a great shock to me that not everyone at Gothamist HQ knew about vital and unifying pop culture moments that played out on MTV, such as Courtney Love&apos;s encounter with Madonna at the 1995 VMAs. It <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084210/http://decider.com/2015/09/07/today-in-tv-history-madonna-courtney-love-vmas-1995/">set standards</a> for feuding in the spotlight! And then in 1999, paving the way for the likes of Kanye, our very own John Del Signore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084210/https://theawl.com/bite-me-kanye-i-bum-rushed-the-mtv-video-music-awards-ten-years-ago-this-week-f3cae94e43db#.iohvgfcgq">crashed the stage</a> as the Backstreet Boys were accepting their Viewers&apos; Choice Moonman award.</p>

<p>Know your history, young people&#x2014;I was not alive in 1969 when Alice Cooper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084210/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq9bEzADxyk">massacred a chicken</a>, <em>but I knew about it</em>, somehow, without even having the entire internet to educate me.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unsurprising, however, that MTV is more important to Gen Xers than the Millennial generation, as the channel itself was more important in its earlier decades&#x2014;if we wanted to see our favorite acts on the screen, that was the only screen available. Secondly, MTV&apos;s programming was better then, which is probably why they are trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084210/http://laist.com/2016/07/28/mtv_90s.php">tap back into that era</a> for present-day success. </p>

<p>In an effort to educate and bask briefly in some nostalgia&#x2014;and ahead of their return to New York this weekend&#x2014;here are the best moments from when the MTV VMAs were hosted in NYC. To be a completist about it, I&apos;ve included every time they were hosted here, but really nothing truly spectacular happened after Britney and her snake brought the house down in 2001.</p>
