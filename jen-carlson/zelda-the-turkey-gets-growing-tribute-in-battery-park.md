<p>An urban farm is about to sprout at Battery Park, thanks to the Battery Conservancy&#x2014;and their muse is the park&apos;s own wild turkey, Zelda (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104515/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/zelda_still_kickin_in_battery_park.php">named after F. Scott&apos;s wife</a>, for her frequent breakdown-driven trips there). The farm will be shaped just like the turkey!</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104515/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110324/downtown/urban-farm-shaped-like-turkey-opens-battery-park">DNA Info</a>, the community garden will be enclosed in (a Zelda-shaped) bamboo fence, and stretch an entire acre of the Great Lawn. The president of the Conservancy noted that Zelda has already dropped by, something all are encouraged to do; &quot;It&apos;s here for anyone who thirsts to get their hands in the soil. Please come&#x2014;we need help!&quot;</p>

<p>The idea grew from some local school kids asking if they could plant a vegetable garden in the area, and now there are plenty of plots for everyone. Even local restaurants may be growing produce and herbs there, and they are &quot;eager for downtown residents to claim some of the 80 plots as well.&quot;</p>

<p>The farm will officially open on April 11th, and a 10 a.m. ceremony. Until then, keep up with the progress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104515/http://www.thebattery.org/news/?tag=urban-farm">right here</a>. Okay, now what about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104515/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/05/urban_farming.php">a vertical farm</a>?</p>
