<p>It would seem that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051014/http://gothamist.com/tags/courtneylove">Courtney Love</a> has a private Twitter account (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051014/http://www.twitter.com/cbabymichelle">@cbabymichelle</a>) reserved for things that should probably <em>actually</em> be reserved for a diary or personal phone call. Like this thing last night when she accused former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl of hitting on (and possibly sleeping with) Frances Bean, the daughter of Courtney and the late Kurt Cobain. The two are about 24 years apart, and Grohl first knew Frances Bean as a newborn baby. So the accusations are pretty damning <em>IF</em> to be believed.</p>

<p>Love wrote: &quot;I heard from Frannie&apos;s roommate that @DaveGrohl hit on Frances, and that she was curious, I&apos;m not mad at her, him I am about to shoot, dead.&quot; She then seems to confirm that her daughter <em>did</em> sleep with Grohl, noting that she heard &quot;it is in fact a fact,&quot; and then: &quot;no it was a rumor, the driver confirmed that they were dropped off at his Laurel Canyon home alone.&quot; She also adds that Grohl was &quot;sexually obsessed with Kurt.&quot; LA LA LA this is all making us feel uncomfortable and is starting to play out in our head like a Noah Baumbach film about the First Family of Grunge. Here are some more of those Tweets:</p>

<p>Right now these are all just accusations, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413051014/http://gawker.com/5901050/courtney-love-accuses-dave-grohl-of-seducing-her-daughter">Gawker</a> notes that the two have had a &quot;longstanding beef.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Dave Grohl&apos;s publicist at Nasty Little Man says: &quot;Unfortunately Courtney is on another hateful twitter rant. These new accusations are upsetting, offensive and absolutely untrue.&quot;</p>
