										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0209brod.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519231816im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0209brod.jpg" width="140" height="91" class="image-right"> </span>It seems the MTA/NYC Transit crew quietly fixed the &quot;Brodaway&quot; typo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519231816/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/09/subway_typo.php">we spotted</a> recently. Someone at SubChat wrote that as of this past Monday the misspelled tile sign was &quot;corrected by using a thermal tile marking device by covering the squares in black (I did see the original lettered outline underneath), then place each a white &apos;A&apos; and &apos;D&apos; over it, but with a slightly bolder font, in what is now in their proper setting.&quot; Sounds like a quick, inexpensive fix (albeit more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519231816/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/10/do_not_lean_font_questions.php">inconsistent font</a> work), but it didn&apos;t stick! Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519231816/http://www.subchat.com/read.asp?Id=746413">SubChat</a> post from yesterday declares it is back to &quot;Brodaway&quot; and suggests the MTA &quot;leave things alone so that the sign can remain as part of the lore (and lure) of the subway.&quot;</p>
