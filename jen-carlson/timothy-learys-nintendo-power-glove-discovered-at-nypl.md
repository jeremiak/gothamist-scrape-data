<p>The man Richard Nixon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045240/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/remember/leary_5-31.html">once dubbed</a> as &quot;the most dangerous man in America&quot; had some sweet toys to pair up with his arsenal of psychedelics&#x2014;this week while going through their archives, the New York Public Library <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045240/http://nypl.tumblr.com/post/36741758673/we-just-had-to-share-this-with-you-while-taking-a">discovered</a> they were in possession of Timothy Leary&apos;s Nintendo Power Glove, along with his red-laced Adidas. They declare: &quot;This made us very happy,&quot; but <em>unfortunately</em> for now the rest of us will just have to be happy knowing this exists, as the items are not yet accessible to the public. It&apos;s like we&apos;re Fred Savage in the classic 1989 video game film <em>The Wizard</em>, admiring the Power Glove from afar:</p>

<p>However, we&apos;re told that &quot;some time next year when it is finished being cataloged and processed&quot; the collection, including these items, will be made available to the public. Currently, everything is being cataloged by the NYPL archivists and curators.</p>
