</div></div>					<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927064546/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00EEDB153AF934A25753C1A9629C8B63">the NY Times</a> wrote about The Hole back in 2004, they said, &quot;It is the closest thing New York has to a border town... an isolated neighborhood that straddles the Brooklyn-Queens line. The five blocks at the junction of Conduit Avenue and Linden Boulevard have all the characteristics of a frontier town in the Old West.&quot; Now, years later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927064546/http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2009/08/hole.html">Nate Kensinger</a> has visited the almost-ghost town and come back to tell the story with plenty of gorgeous images of the decay. He says, &quot;The Hole is literally a hole. It is 30 feet below grade... sunken down from the busy roads around it. The neighborhood floods often and is only a few feet above the water table, so its homes are &apos;not incorporated into the city sewer system. They all have cesspools.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The Hole is known for its history as a body dumping ground for the mafia. One resident told Kensinger about the development that temporarily housed &quot;200 dead bodies.&quot; Such activity dates back to at least 28 years ago, when the &quot;the body of a Bonanno crime family captain&quot; was found there. And since nothing says mafia like horses, that is the 2nd thing the area is known for. Reportedly &quot;it was once populated by vast fields of horses. Many belonged to The Federation of Black Cowboys, who hold an annual rodeo nearby.&quot; The horses were &quot;evicted&quot; in 2002. </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927064546/http://www.imposemagazine.com/photo-essay-in-the-hole/24182/">learn more here</a>, but sadly, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927064546/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/18/a_look_at_abandoned_far_rockaway.php">Far Rockaway</a>, this unique neighborhood&apos;s future is uncertain.</p>
