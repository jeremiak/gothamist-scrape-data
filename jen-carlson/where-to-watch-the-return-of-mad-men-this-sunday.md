<p>Have you heard? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145743/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> is finally returning this Sunday after 18 long and lonely months away from our television screens. Should you choose to soak up the two-hour premiere with some friends and era-appropriate cocktails, we&apos;ve got you covered below...</p>

<p><strong>AT DON&apos;S OLD DIGS</strong><br>
In Season 2 of <em>Mad Men</em>, Don Draper lives at The Roosevelt Hotel for multiple episodes, and now you can head to his old digs to take in the premiere. The hotel&apos;s Madison Club Lounge invites you over to sip vintage cocktails, smoke (candy) cigarettes, and toast to the return of Don. There&apos;s a 3-course prix fix menu ($27), and a happy hour from 7 to 8 p.m. &apos;60s attire is encouraged! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145743/http://kittybradshaw.com/nyc-events-mad-men/">More details here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DRAPER, DRINKS &amp; DINNER</strong><br>
The Tribeca Grand Cinemas will be hosting a classy cocktail party in celebration of the show&apos;s return on Sunday. They promise cocktails, pocket squares, and gourmet finger foods like truffle mushroom risotto balls, smoked salmon blinis, and tuna tartare. Attendees are also encouraged to dress to impress, in Draper-approved duds. If you want in, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145743/http://rewards.thrillist.com/deal/6766">you&apos;ll have to sign up here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SMOKE &apos;EM IF YOU GOT &apos;EM</strong><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145743/http://blog.zagat.com/2012/03/mad-men-party-at-carnegie-club-happy.html">The Carnegie Club cigar lounge</a> in Midtown will officially unveil an extensive renovation in conjunction with their viewing party on Sunday. They tell us, &quot;With very few places remaining in New York to enjoy a cigar while sipping on a cocktail, The Carnegie Club was the first in New York and indoor smoking remains in style at this swanky lounge.&quot; They&apos;ll also be pouring a specialty cocktail, The Don Draper, which consists of sweet vermouth, pineapple juice, and gin.</p>
