                            <p>Last night around 7:30 p.m., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006162915/https://twitter.com/jtimberlake/statuses/372864240488837120">Justin Timberlake Tweeted</a> that he would be playing one song (&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006162915/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEzREJbln-o">Take Back The Night</a>&quot;) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006162915/http://gothamist.com/tags/maxwell&apos;s">Maxwell&apos;s in Hoboken</a> for a Target commercial. And like that, Washington Street filled up with screaming ladies. Ladies, ladies, ladies, <em>what compels you to scream so much in the face of celebrity?</em></p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20131006162915if_/http://instagram.com/p/dlOrlZlaqL/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>While only 150 people were let in to the venue&#x2014;including JT&apos;s wife Jessica Biel&#x2014;the streets were swarmed with hundreds of others, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006162915/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2013/08/justin_timberlake_hoboken_maxwells_target.html">according to NJ.com</a>. They also report that paparazzi climbed fire escapes in hopes of getting a good shot of the star&#x2014;which just seems like a comical scene. </p>

<p>The legendary Maxwell&apos;s closed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006162915/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/01/farewell_to_maxwells.php#photo-1">on July 31st</a> with a blowout featuring some of the original bands (&quot;a&quot;, the Bongos) that played the space... does JT&apos;s short performance mean he now bookends the musical history of the beloved venue? </p>

<p>At least one of the bands that&apos;s been loyal to Maxwell&apos;s had some fun with the star, while highlighting the terrible parking situation in Hoboken&#x2014;something venue owners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006162915/http://www.policymic.com/articles/57785/maxwell-s-hoboken-closing-the-end-of-an-era">noted</a> as being a real problem (&quot;parking for a show at Maxwell&#x2019;s ended up being a bigger ordeal than many anticipated&quot;).</p>
