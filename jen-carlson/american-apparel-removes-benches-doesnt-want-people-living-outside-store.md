<p>Remember when the benches outside of American Apparel on Houston and Orchard streets were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005842/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/16/the_bench.php"><em>the</em> place to be</a>? It was a very &quot;this too shall pass&quot; moment, and it did. The benches, however, remained... until now. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005842/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2010/08/american-apparel-on-east-houston-removes-benches.html#more-18464">Bowery Boogie</a>, 5 of the 9 benches on Orchard Street have been removed by American Apparel; an employee at the store said it was a &#x201C;whole ordeal,&#x201D; but essentially the company &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t want people living outside the store anymore.&#x201D; Because Dov Charney though they clashed with his new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005842/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/13/dov_charney_declares_death_of_hipst.php">preppy image</a>? </p>

<p>They claim the move also had to do with safety concerns for their employees leaving the store after 2 a.m. But they need not fear with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005842/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2010/03/the-mayor-of-upper-orchard-street.html">Nathan</a>, the mayor of Upper Orchard Street watching over things. He reportedly still has his bench... though Mr. Charney may <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005842/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/17/american-apparel-bankrupt_1_n_685069.html">need it for himself</a> soon enough.</p>
