	<p>Think back to the poor animals who existed when the internet wasn&apos;t around yet&#x2014;where was their fame? Their meme? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141909/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/grumpy_cat_at_sxsw.php">Their all-expense paid trip to SXSW</a>? Sure, the ones that were captured on real film can have something of a rebirth once their photos have been digitally archived, but it&apos;s just not the same&#x2014;just think about what they could have done if YouTube, Instagram, and Buzzfeed were around to capture and commodify their cuteness. Instead, they just got to be adored by one, maybe two humans. If that&apos;s not a sad enough tale for you, think about all the lost pageview potential as you click through these photos of animals who would have gone totally VIRAL had they existed today.</p>
