<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="dunst09099.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045146im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/dunst09099.jpg" width="200" height="250" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier we noted that actress Kirsten Dunst was heading to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045146/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/09/24/2009-09-24_dunst_to_testify_as_victim_of_heist_ripped_off_in_soho_hotel_in_07.html">the courthouse</a> today to testify against a Manhattan mechanic accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045146/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/24/dunst.php">stealing the actress&apos;s handbags</a> and whatnot, while she was stationed at the SoHo Grand hotel penthouse. 35-year-old James Jimenez now faces 15 years in prison if convicted; his accomplice, Jarrod Beinerman, was already sentenced to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045146/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/04/dunst_1.php">4 years</a>.</p>

<p>The court appearance already took place and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045146/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/a-star-turn-in-a-manhattan-courtroom/">CityRoom</a> reports back saying &quot;the stakes [at hand] were lost in Ms. Dunst&#x2019;s charming, innocent demeanor.&quot; Or, you know, the fact that the prosecutor turned fanboy and asked her to name some recent movies she had acted in. She was in, oh, you know (dimples!) <em>Spider-Man</em> and <em>Little Women</em> and stuff. Yes, theft is wrong, but is that resume worth sending a man to jail for 15 years for... <em>for stealing a Balenciaga handbag</em>?</p>

<p>Reportedly after charming the courtroom with her testimony, &quot;She popped up, bit her bottom lip and smiled on her way out.&quot;</p>
