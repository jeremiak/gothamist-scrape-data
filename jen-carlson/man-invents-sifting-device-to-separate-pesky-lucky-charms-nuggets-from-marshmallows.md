<p>This is coming on to the market <em>way</em> too late for us to enjoy with our Saturday Morning Cartoons, but better late than never. Kids (or adults who still eat Lucky Charms on a regular basis&#x2014;we&apos;re not here to judge), the future is now. Some genius has invented a device to sift the health<em>ier</em> bits of the cereal out of the cereal, leaving you with only the dehydrated marshmallows, just as nature intended. </p>

<p>Inventor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521091712/http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12772">Tom Lombardi</a> explains, &quot;The holes are sized to catch most charms, you should be able to sift &gt; 90% of them.&quot; You&apos;ll just have to hand pick the rest if you want the ultimate sugar high, just like we did in the old days.
