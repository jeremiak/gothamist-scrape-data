</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102716/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/cat_fashion_show.php">2010 Algonquin Hotel Cat Fashion Show</a> was the gold standard in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102716/http://gothamist.com/tags/catfashionshow">Cat Fashion Shows</a>. Ask anyone. Ask Veronica Corningstone. The ones that came in the following years didn&apos;t quite have the same specialness to them. Maybe because cats hates wearing clothes. Maybe something else. But the shows have gone on, and this year is no exception. On Wednesday August 10th, the Algonquin will host their 10th annual Cat Fashion Show with hotel cat Matilda III. And they&apos;re promising it&apos;s going to be better than ever. </p>

<p>The party will be run from 5 to 7:30 p.m. in the hotel&#x2019;s iconic lobby, where at 6 p.m. cats will take the catwalk donning clothing by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102716/http://www.adanieves.com/">Ada Nieves</a>, a certified animal fashion designer by the Fashion Institute of Technology. This year&apos;s theme is Through the Decades, and &quot;will honor the iconic looks of the hotel&#x2019;s most famous guests and patrons, including Al Hirschfeld, Michael Feinstein, Marilyn Monroe, John Barrymore and many more.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The aim is to raise $10,000 for the Mayor&#x2019;s Alliance for NYC&#x2019;s Animals, so keep that in mind when you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102716/https://www.501auctions.com/algonquincelebration">chip in your $50</a> to attend. 100% of the proceeds will benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102716/http://www.animalalliancenyc.org/">the Alliance</a>, and you&apos;ll get to partake in an auction, watch the show, and there&apos;s even a reception with special hors d&#x2019;oeuvres. A note from organizers: &quot;Guests attending the event are encouraged to wear their best feline inspired outfit.&quot;<br>
