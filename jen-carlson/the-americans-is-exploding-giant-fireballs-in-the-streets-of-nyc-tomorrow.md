<p>The new FX show <em>The Americans</em> (recommended!) takes place in the 1980s Cold War-era suburbs of Washington D.C., but they&apos;ve been filming around New York City, and tomorrow the production returns with not one, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021193246/http://parkslopestoop.com/blog/crime/travel-down-union-street-to-see-the-giant-fireball-tomorrow"><em>two</em> explosions</a>. The crew will be setting up shop in both Brooklyn (Union Street between Hicks and Columbia Streets) and Queens (Park Lane South between 112th and 115th Streets) to EXPLODE FIREBALLS between the hours of 6 and 10 p.m.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve seen the &quot;controlled explosion with a fireball effect&quot; before, when <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> set one off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021193246/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/boardwalk_empire_2.php">last summer</a>... and people, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021193246/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/amazing_video_of_boardwalk_empire_f.php">they do not disappoint</a>. We&apos;ve contacted the FDNY to see if they have any more details on the size of these explosions, and will update when we hear back.</p>

<p>The show stars Keri Russell (n&#xE9;e <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021193246/http://gothamist.com/tags/felicity">Felicity</a>) and Matthew Rhys, who play KGB spies posing as a married couple&#x2014;it&apos;s unclear if they&apos;ll be on set tomorrow.</p>
