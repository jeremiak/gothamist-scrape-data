</p><p>[UPDATE BELOW SORRY MACY&apos;S] Last night Macy&apos;s scared the American spirit right out of some Upper West Siders when they decided to test their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729102846/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/usher_to_curate_macys_4th_of_july_f.php">Usher-curated</a> 4th of July fireworks at 9:30 p.m. Gothamist&apos;s own Jen Chung described them as &quot;SCARY LOUD,&quot; adding, &quot;I was really worried.&quot; She also said she &quot;would like a personal apology from Usher.&quot; Of course, a lot of New York was oblivious <em>since the fireworks are still on the Hudson</em> and not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729102846/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/28/macys_to_screw_over_brooklyn_queens.php">East River</a>. <br>

The real fireworks will take place around 8 p.m. on July 4th (they&apos;ll be aired on NBC for those who can&apos;t see them <em>because they&apos;re still on the Hudson</em>)... and did you know that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729102846/http://www.taylorswiftweb.net/2013/06/20/taylor-to-perform-at-macys-fireworks-spectacular/">Taylor Swift is performing</a>?<br>

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Macy&apos;s tells us, &quot;This was not a Macy&apos;s event.&quot; Turns out Macy&apos;s tests <em>their</em> fireworks out in the Mojave desert. Well la di da.</p>
