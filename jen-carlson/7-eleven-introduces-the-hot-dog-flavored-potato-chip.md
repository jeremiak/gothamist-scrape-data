<p>There are a fair amount of 7-Eleven stores around New York City (let&apos;s say... 26? Who&apos;s counting? No one.), which means there&apos;s a fair amount of stores that will sell you Hot Dog Flavored Potato Chips. That&apos;s correct, fellow American, the franchise has just introduced their latest product, which got its flavor inspiration from 7-Eleven&apos;s own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225024948/http://www.7-eleven.com/Food/Hot/Big-Bite/Default.aspx">Big Bite hot dog</a>. There are also ketchup, mustard and relish spiced chips, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225024948/http://laughingsquid.com/big-bite-hot-dog-flavored-potato-chips-at-7-eleven/">Laughing Squid</a>&#x2014;so in theory, you could mix all of these up for what one Gothamist staffer called &quot;a symphony in my mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>At press time, the chip has 13 too many friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225024948/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Bite-Hot-Dog-Potato-Chips/106210686146598">on Facebook</a>. And out of eight people polled in the office, only two brave souls said they would try them, one declaring, &quot;Hell yeah. They go well with the shrimp-flavor chips in Asian groceries.&quot; But do they <em>really</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225024948/http://gothamist.com/profile/arts_jamie">Jamie</a>?</p>
