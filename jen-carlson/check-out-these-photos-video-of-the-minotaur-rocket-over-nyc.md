                            <p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208075405/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/19/see_a_rocket_launch_tonight.php">a rocket named Minotaur 1 launched</a> from a Virginia spaceport into the sky over the Eastern seaboard and it. Was. Glorious. The rocket was on a record-breaking mission to put 29 satellites into orbit and, less importantly and not at all acknowledged by NASA, on a mission to dazzle New Yorkers by lighting up the night sky. Missions: accomplished. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208075405/http://www.space.com/23665-spectacular-night-rocket-launch-skywatcher-photos.html">Space.com</a>, &quot;Tuesday&apos;s rocket launch was orchestrated by the U.S. military&apos;s Operationally Responsive Space Office and was aimed primarily at launching the U.S. Air Force&apos;s $55 million STPSat-3 satellite, which is carrying five experiments and sensors to measure the space environment. The 28 other tiny cubesat satellites included TJ3Sat, the first-ever satellite designed and built by high school students, and NASA&apos;s new PhoneSat 2.4, a satellite built from smartphone components.&quot;</p>

<p>Click through for a look at some shots of it over the city, and if you spotted it&apos;s blaze of glory and captured a photo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208075405/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send it along</a>.</p>
