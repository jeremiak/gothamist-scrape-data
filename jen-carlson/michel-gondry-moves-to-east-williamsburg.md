The director reportedly purchased a house on Orient Avenue in East Williamsburg, and while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009093315/http://curbed.com/archives/2008/07/14/eternal_sunshine_in_the_burg.php">Curbed</a> notes that a house from <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009093315/http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2007/03/house_of_the_da_272.php">also on Orient Avenue</a>, this isn&apos;t the one the director purchased -- that house was sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009093315/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2008/02/house-of-day-orient-avenue-fixer-upper.html">a fixer-upper</a>! Gondry has some celluloid ties to the borough aside from the <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> house -- last week he was directing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009093315/http://pardonmeforasking.blogspot.com/2008/07/day-of-shooting-on-smith-results-in.html">a Microsoft commercial</a> there, and back in 2004 he filmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009093315/http://gothamist.com/2004/09/20/dave_chappelles_block_partyfilmfugees_reunion.php">Dave Chappelle&apos;s Block Party</a>. Maybe the quirky director will put some energy into creative lawn decorations!<br>
