<p>The woman who accompanied the Craigslist poster, Tom Dobrowski (a real estate investment expert), was none other than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171815/http://www.insatiable-critic.com/Article.aspx?ID=357&amp;keyword=Short%20Order:%20Hot%20news,%20gossip,%20nibbles,%20and%20bits">Insatiable Critic</a>, Gael Greene (pictured). She got her in by responding to his post with: &#x201C;Momofuko Ko with a mouth that has forty years reviewing restaurants at New York magazine could be fun?&#x201D; To which he retorted, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m choosing you over Frank Bruni.&#x201D; </p>

<p>No word on how the grub was, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171815/http://eater.com/archives/2008/05/when_good_peopl.php">Eater</a> has the details on what really went down. They report Tom didn&apos;t get any responses until Greene&apos;s last minute reply, and despite having already canceled his reservation, the two went anyway.</p><blockquote>What if, Gael still unrecognized, they do get seated and throw the whole machine into Defcon 5&#x2014;Drew, chief of Momo Ops, shows up, Chang hurried to a secure bunker, etc.&#x2014;and, worst of all, the poor couple who had snagged a last minute resy at Ko had to sit at a makeshift table up front. But, then, what if Gael and Tom&apos;s meal was comped. What if the house said: &quot;If the confusion was our fault, please accept our apologies. If you tried to sneak your way into Ko, we don&apos;t want your money.&quot;</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171815/http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/04/kos_first_non_rave_finally_arr.html">Grub Street</a>, where Greene noticed the Craigslist posting first, pointed out that not all foodies are lovin&apos; it at Ko; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504171815/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120948049053952941.html?mod=2_1354_topbox">the WSJ</a> recently reported back on the unfriendly staff and uncomfortable &quot;backless, uncushioned wooden stools.&quot;<p></p>
