</div></div>					<p>Multiple people are injured after a Seastreak commuter ferry crashed at the Pier 11 ferry terminal in Lower Manhattan this morning around 8:45 a.m. An FDNY spokesman says there are at least 10 to 15 people injured, and it appears that one passenger is seriously injured. According to preliminary reports, the ferry slammed into the dock, sustaining significant damage. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134412/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaStreak#Vessels">vessel</a> has a capacity of 400 passengers &quot;and travels at a service speed of 38 knots (44 mph),&quot; though it&apos;s unclear what speed it was going at the time of this morning&apos;s accident.</p>

<p>People on the scene have been Tweeting and uploading photos, noting &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134412/http://instagram.com/p/URAprzl-xt/">so many people injured or here</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134412/https://twitter.com/cahillny/status/289008310491967489">Fire trucks and boats everywhere can&apos;t dock</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Following the accident, just after 9 a.m., Seastreak updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134412/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151401488645350&amp;set=a.10150410472020350.415396.113674505349&amp;type=1">their Facebook page</a> saying, &quot;Good Morning Seastreak Riders ~ Enjoy your ride this beautiful winter morning!&quot; One commenter noted, &quot;Not the people who just got hurt.&quot; </p>

<p>The Seastreak provides &quot;daily, year-round ferry services from Atlantic Highlands and Conners Highlands, NJ to Pier 11 Wall Street, East 35th Street, and shuttle service to the World Financial Center.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ll update as more information becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 9:45 a.m.:</strong> Reports are coming in that there are over 50 injuries, two of which are serious. </p>

<p>One passenger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134412/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8947393">told ABC</a>, &quot;Once you basically pass the Statue of Liberty, you pretty much know that you&apos;re going to be there soon, so a lot of people start standing up, milling around, getting their coats and everything like that. Anybody who was standing went to the ground.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 10:25 a.m.:</strong> An NYPD officer on the scene tells us that there are an estimated 57 people injured, one critically injured with a head injury. Brett Cesulash, who was on the ferry when it collided with the pier, told us that &quot;If people were standing, they fell over, and those near the glass went through the glass.&quot; He added that people were &quot;calm for the most part.&quot; We were told that there 3 people were seriously injured, and currently 2 are stable, and one is critically injured.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, 11:30 a.m.:</strong> A press conference was held on the pier following the incident, where DoT commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan and Police commissioner Ray Kelly were in attendance (Mayor Bloomberg also stopped by the scene briefly). Officials said the vessel was traveling at 10-12 knots, which is around 11 mph, at the time of the accident&#x2014;it hit one pier (slip D), and then another (slip B). There were 150 first responders on the scene within 3 mins. Sadik-Khan noted that there were a total of 326 passengers and 5 crew members on board. The most serious injury sustained was when a man fell down the steps upon impact (he is currently at Cornell Hospital), and two others in critical condition sustained head injuries.</p>
