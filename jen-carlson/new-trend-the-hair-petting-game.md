Okay, let&apos;s hope it&apos;s not a new trend. The above video is shocking, but mostly because these girls don&apos;t get punched in the face. Not once! We&apos;re sure there was a lot of hostility left on the cutting room floor. 

</p><p>So what is the hair petting game? The girls in the video demonstrate by walking around Manhattan and secretly petting the hair of strangers when they are walking behind them. A risky move! And one we hope does not catch on. </p>
