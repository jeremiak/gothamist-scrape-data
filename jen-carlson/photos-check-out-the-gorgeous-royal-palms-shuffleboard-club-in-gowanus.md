</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ve been waiting years for this moment&#x2014;in 2012 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080111/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/why_arent_there_any_real_shuffleboa.php">we wished for a shuffleboard club</a> to open to NYC, and the following day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080111/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/shuffleboard.php">our wish was answered</a>. (It was kind of weird, actually, and we&apos;re still grappling with <em>what it all means</em>.) Anyway, at the time Jonathan Schnapp and Ashley Albert told us they had started working on opening a club in Brooklyn, and now It&apos;s All Happening.</p>

<p>While the club is still in soft open mode, they plan to officially open at some point next week, with biscuits, tangs, beer, and cocktails. As we previously noted, there are 10 courts, a full bar, a rotating cast of food trucks (which will be parked in an indoor food truck bay), and of course the big draw: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080111/http://gothamist.com/tags/shuffleboard">shuffleboard</a>. The courts will cost $40 an hour (but split four ways that&apos;s just $10). </p>

<p>Located at 514 Union Street in Gowanus, the gorgeous space brings an old timey Florida vibe to Brooklyn&#x2014;it sort of IS your grandmother&apos;s shuffleboard club. There will be leagues (the Monday night league is already sold out, and the Tuesday one is filling up now), and maybe even some bingo, eventually. Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080111/https://www.facebook.com/RoyalPalmsShuffle">their Facebook</a> for updates, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080111/http://www.royalpalmsshuffle.com/">their website</a> for information on leagues.</p>
