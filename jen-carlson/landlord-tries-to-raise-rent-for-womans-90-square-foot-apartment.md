<p>Last year we met a woman living in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023038/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/video_woman_shows_off_90-square-foo.php">90-square-foot apartment</a> (which is palatial compared to the guy in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023038/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/06/video_is_this_78-square-foot_apartm.php">78-square-foot</a> one), but it appears that all of her publicity may have been a bad thing, as her landlord tried to raise her rent soon after. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023038/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/movin_on_up_07EKEnrObMH7V68rpM883K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, Felice Cohen&#x2014;who had been paying $700/month for the Upper West Side pad&#x2014;was illegally subletting, and her landlord tried to raise the rent when he found out. </p>

<p>Cohen, having saved so much money living in the tight space over the past five years, has now moved out to a 500-square-foot apartment. As for her old pad? She says, &quot;Now my landlord said he will renovate the space and up the rent to $1,200.&quot; Anyone looking for a challenge, there&apos;s about to be a 90-square-foot apartment on the market! Assuming her landlord doesn&apos;t add any more square feet during the renovation process.</p>
