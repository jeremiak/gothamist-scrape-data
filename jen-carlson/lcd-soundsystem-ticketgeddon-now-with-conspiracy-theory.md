<p>As you may recall, earlier this month LCD Soundsystem announced their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074624/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/05/lcd_soundsytem_announce_last_show_e.php">final show</a>, to be performed at MSG this April. When tickets went on sale, they sold out in seconds, and many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074624/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/11/this_is_happening_lcd_soundsystem_t.php">landed on StubHub</a> with shiny new inflated pricetags. There was outrage from both fans and James Murphy himself, and eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074624/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/12/lcd_soundsystem_fight_scalpers_with.php">four more shows</a> were added, to be held at a smaller venue: Terminal 5 (tickets on sale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074624/http://lcdsoundsystem.com/main/archives/654">tomorrow</a>). But were those shows planned anyway? To the conspiracy board! Felix Salmon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074624/http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/02/19/the-dynamic-economics-of-lcd-soundsystem-tickets/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+felix-all+(Felix+Salmon+-+All+(Reuters+%2B+FS.com))">at Reuters</a> investigates a theory that the MSG shows never, in fact, sold out. </p><blockquote>&quot;The conspiracy theory goes like this: LCD Soundsystem&#x2019;s promoter, Bowery Presents, owns Terminal 5. By holding back most of the MSG tickets, secondary-market prices would be sure to skyrocket. The way that MSG is structured, the coveted general-admission area in front of the stage is actually pretty small, which means that it&#x2019;s quite easy to generate a handful of headline-grabbing offers of tickets for sale at $10,000 apiece or more. If they wanted, LCD&#x2019;s promoters could even put those offers up themselves, and then encourage the band to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074624/http://twitter.com/#!/lcdsoundsystem/status/36120409967431680">complain in public</a> about the exorbitant prices.<p></p>

<p>After getting everybody&#x2019;s attention by artificially clamping down on the supply of MSG tickets, LCD&#x2019;s promoters can then easily sell out four or more shows at their own venue, Terminal 5, which by coincidence just happened to be unbooked in the run-up to the MSG gig. Given all the buzz that this activity creates, the unsold MSG tickets can then be quietly disposed of on StubHub and other secondary-market sites.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Salmon notes that Bowery Presents knows exactly how many tickets were sold for the MSG show, but they&apos;re not releasing those numbers since it&apos;s in their interest that everyone believes 13,000 tickets sold out in seconds. We&apos;ve contacted John Moore at Bowery Presents for a comment on this theory, and will update when we hear back... but we&apos;re told he&apos;s on vacation for another week, so don&apos;t hold your breath.</p>
