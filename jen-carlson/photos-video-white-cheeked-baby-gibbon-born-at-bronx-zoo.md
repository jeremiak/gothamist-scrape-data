<p>A new baby white-cheeked gibbon (a critically endangered species) was born at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155421/http://gothamist.com/tags/bronxzoo">the Bronx Zoo</a>, and it&apos;s time to welcome it with some &quot;ooohs,&quot; &quot;ahhhs,&quot; and &quot;awwws&quot;&#x2014;to help, the Wildlife Conservation Society has sent over some B-roll footage of the happy gibbon family:</p>

<p>This is the first gibbon born at the Bronx Zoo since 2000, and they tell us the happy parents are 35-year-old Christine (or &#x201C;Kicks&#x201D;), and 15-year-old Milton&#x2014;while Christine has 11 offspring, this is young Milton&apos;s first! Though it has not yet been determined if the new gibbon is a boy or girl&#x2014;&quot;All newborns are born with a buff coat that turns black over their first two years. Once they reach sexual maturity, males remain black and females change back to their lighter color.&quot;</p>
