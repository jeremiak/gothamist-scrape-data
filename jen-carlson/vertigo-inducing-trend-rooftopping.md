</div></div>					<p>So long planking, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330065109/http://allday.today.com/_news/2011/08/12/7354976-klg-and-hoda-join-horsemaning-internet-craze">horsemaning</a>&#x2014;those trends are child&apos;s play compared to the new craze: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330065109/http://laughingsquid.com/rooftopping-taking-death-defying-photos-from-the-tops-of-buildings">rooftopping</a>. Essentially, you get to a roof, go to the edge, look down, and snap a photo. </p>

<p>It&apos;s not really new to everyone; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330065109/http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/exclusive-interview-with-a">recent interview</a> with &quot;well-known rooftopper&quot; Tom Ryaboi reveals he&apos;s been doing it since 2007, and Jerry Seinfeld was an early adopter, rooftopping over Central Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330065109/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/27/flashback_that_time_jerry_seinfeld.php">back in 1990</a>! </p>

<p>As for Ryaboi, he says he &quot;got a rush from getting on these roofs, especially the first moments as I came out of the hatch (of a skyscraper). Looking out across the plane of the horizon everything becomes unhurried, it&apos;s almost like you see the world in slow motion, fully visceral.&quot; But it just gives us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150330065109/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/is_this_the_most_vertigo-inducing_p.php">a bad case of vertigo</a>.
