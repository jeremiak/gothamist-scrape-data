<p>New parents Beyonc&#xE9; and Jay-Z haven&apos;t yet showed off their daughter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003842/http://gothamist.com/tags/blueivy">Blue Ivy</a>, to the public (friends say she&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003842/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kelly-rowland-beyonces-baby-blue-ivy-is-so-beautiful-2012251">so beautiful</a>&quot;), but they have announced her godparents. Or rather, a source has done it for them. And it&apos;s a real &quot;Aha Moment!&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003842/http://cdn.mediatakeout.com/53808/breaking-news-the-godmother-and-godfather-of-beyonce-s-baby-girl-have-been-announced-and-one-is-a-huge-celeb.html">MediaTakeout</a>, a &quot;reliable insider&quot; says that the parents didn&apos;t want to name family members as godparents, so they went with Jay&apos;s friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130003842/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1115293/">Tyran Smith</a>, and the most powerful woman in the universe, Oprah. It&apos;s safe to say this kid&apos;s gonna have a pretty pampered lifestyle.</p>
