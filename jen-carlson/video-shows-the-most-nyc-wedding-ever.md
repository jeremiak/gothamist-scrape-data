<p>On July 8th, the friends and family of a couple who can only (and affectionately) be described as bringing &quot;adorkable&quot; back, gathered on the Staten Island Ferry for a totally unauthorized wedding aboard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108020223/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/28/bloomberg_wont_shut_up_about_how_th.php">the world&apos;s most romantic ship</a>.</p>

<p>Groom Keith Haskel (who married Bethany Hall) tells us, &quot;Man, it could&apos;ve went so poorly (90 degree day and predicted thunderstorms), but it nearly went off without a hitch! The bride was 15 minutes late, so we missed a ferry or two, but no one ever tried to stop us.&quot; The whole affair&#x2014;which included a trip on the subway to a party in Williamsburg&#x2014;was filmed, and you can watch it below. It&apos;s the most NYC wedding we&apos;ve ever seen... and as such, mass transit provided the day&apos;s only hiccups.</p>

<p>Haskel says, &quot;Things that got in the way were an announcement about docking in Staten Island interrupting my vows and an MTA worker stopping the 1 train until our party-goers got down from standing on the seats.&quot; But music helped things, he says&#x2014;&quot;We staged a violinist to play wedding songs on the ferry, two fun-loving friends to march us to the subway, and to make that stinky underground transfer from the 1-train to the L more bearable, we stationed our guitarist friend Mark Shock to sing songs for the party&apos;s arrival.&quot;</p>

<p>Haskel also gave us some tips for future couples on a budget: &quot;I gotta say, the Staten Island Ferry is an incredibly undervalued NYC resource.  It&apos;s free, so we saved thousands on a venue, you&apos;re allowed to drink on it, so popping champagne is fair game, and it&apos;s BEAUTIFUL!  You got the whole view of Manhattan behind you, Lady Liberty on your right, and you&apos;re on a mother effing BOAT!&quot;</p>
