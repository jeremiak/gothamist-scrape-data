<p>In 1991 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010121/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidlynch">David Lynch</a> created this public service announcement to draw attention to the city&apos;s rat problem (he does love to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010121/http://www.lynchnet.com/ads/">make ads</a>). The director of photography for the PSA was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010121/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005695/">Frederick Elmes</a>, who also worked with Lynch on <em>Blue Velvet</em>, and together they put the city&apos;s rodent problem in simple (and somewhat creepy) black &amp; white terms.
