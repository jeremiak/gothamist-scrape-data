<p><strong>You lived in Williamsburg for about 7 years until you started a perpetual touring lifestyle last June. Do you miss the city when you&apos;re on the road or is it a nice break for you?</strong><br>
New York is the only place I know of where if you stay too long, you get sick of it, but the instant you leave you miss it.  Things I miss about New York whilst on the road: 24 hour bodegas, instant cheap eats everywhere, amazing-looking people who are boring, boring-looking people who are amazing, a transit system that never shuts down, and a city of 8 million where you still manage to run into everyone you&apos;ve ever known.</p>

<p><strong>You used to play music in the subway. Which were your favorite stations to play?</strong><br>
The 6th ave L train stop which connected to the F train.  Best platforms in the city!</p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved in writing music for Sean Penn&apos;s movie <em>Into The Wild</em>?</strong><br>
Martin Hernandez, the sound editor for <em>Into the Wild</em>, had used some of my music as temp tracks for early edits of the film.  This piqued Sean Penn&apos;s interest and he contacted me and asked if I&apos;d be interested in contributing music.  Slightly intimidating when Sean Penn calls your cell phone . . .</p>

<p><strong>Did you attend the Oscar ceremonies since <em>Into The Wild</em>&apos;s music was nominated?</strong><br>
The music was ineligible for an Oscar (along with several other scores) because of some technicalities.  It was sad, since all I really wanted to say was that I was in the same room as Angelina Jolie.</p>
