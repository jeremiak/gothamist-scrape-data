<p>It&apos;s just about Girl Scout Cookie season, and while we already know there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604172522/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/05/new_girl_scout_cookie.php">a new cookie this year</a>, and we already tested out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604172522/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/21/where_to_find_girl_scout_cookies_th.php">their locator app</a> to make sure we could find the treats once they were on the market again... it doesn&apos;t hurt to cover all your bases. You don&apos;t want to miss out on your annual Thin Mint fix, after all. So with that, we give you a handy list of Girl Scout Cookie Pop-Up Shops that will be opening all over the city on March 13th.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="gscookiepopups.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604172522im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/gscookiepopups.jpeg" width="640" height="344" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Cookies are $4 a box for all varieties&#x2014;including Samoas, Thin Mints, Trefoils, Tagalongs, Do-Si-Dos and the 100th Anniversary cookie, Savannah Smiles. Though be warned (or buy some elastic waist pants), these shops will remain open for a dangerously long period of time, not closing until May 3rd. Resist the urge for multiple visits! <em>Or</em> you could always rationalize your multiple purchases by reminding yourself of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604172522/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/11/teenage_girl_spews_horrible_rant_ag.php">this closed-minded boycott</a>.</p>
