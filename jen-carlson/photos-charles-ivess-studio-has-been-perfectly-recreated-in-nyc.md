His studio was located on the ground floor of his Redding, CT home, where he worked for the last 40 years of his life, and which was sold out of the family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918140842/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443995604578002743997162964">in 2012</a>. At this point, it probably looks nothing like it used to, but prior to the sale the studio had gone untouched since Ives&apos;s death in 1954. Thankfully, when his grandson sold the home he donated the entire contents of the studio to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918140842/http://www.artsandletters.org/">American Academy of Arts and Letters</a>. <p></p>

<p>The Academy has now successfully recreated the studio, which will open to the public on March 6th and be a permanent exhibition. This is a &quot;faithful replica of the room&quot; where Ives &quot;composed and finished several of his major works, including Three Places in New England, The Fourth Symphony, The Second Orchestral Set, The Fourth Violin Sonata, and about 40 songs.&quot;</p>

<p>In the studio are over 3,000 objects, which were catalogued and restored, &quot;including the studio&#x2019;s furnishings and double doors, to which Ives himself had pinned clippings, photos, and keepsakes.&quot; An accompanying exhibition explores Ives&#x2019;s life and work in Redding.</p>
