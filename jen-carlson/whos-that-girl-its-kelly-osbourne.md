<p>This year&apos;s Fashion Week has an unexpected star: Ozzy-spawn Kelly Osbourne! The 25-year-old has been everywhere, even on the runway for Naomi Campbell&apos;s show (center photo), looking very blonde and very thin. She credits her weight loss to pilates and her recent stint on &quot;Dancing With The Stars.&quot; Hopefully she won&apos;t become too bobble-headed! </p>

The duo allegedly spent the night in the hospital after a glass panel fell on her friend and got embedded in her knees.</p>
