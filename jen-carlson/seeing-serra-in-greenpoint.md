<p>What happens when Richard Serra doesn&apos;t sell a piece of art? It goes to Greenpoint, apparently. His current <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210840/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/23/video_of_the_da_76.php">exhibit at the MoMA</a> took a lot of manpower to set up, yet when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210840/http://www.restlus.com/2007/08/snapshot-richard-serra-in-greenpoint.html">Restless blog</a> ran into one of his giant slabs of metal this weekend, there were only five workers moving it. </p>

<blockquote>I walked across the backside of Greenpoint to the subway this morning.  I look under a new roll-up door and guess what?

<p>A Richard Serra slab of heavy metal is sitting there, with 5 workers taking a breather to the side.  I asked the foreman if it was OK to take a picture, and did.  He said the object was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629210840/http://www.gagosian.com/artists/richard-serra/">from Gagosian</a> on 24th, and was unsold.  I offered to haul it away for free, but no luck.  I guess it shouldn&apos;t be a surprise that Greenpoint is back room to Chelsea&apos;s mega-spaces.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>See some Serra at the MoMA (until September 10th), or just start rolling up doors in Greenpoint.</p>
