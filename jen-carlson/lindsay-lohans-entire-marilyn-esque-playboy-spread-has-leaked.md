<p>Earlier this week Lindsay Lohan&apos;s Playboy cover leaked, and now the entire spread has found its way onto the internet. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174630/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/25/lindsay_lohan_bares_all_for_1_milli.php">January/February issue</a> features ten photos of the actress baring her breasts and butt for Heffner&apos;s cameras. There are also words, <em>hilarious words</em>, describing Lohan&#x2014;like the words that call her a &quot;silver screen siren,&quot; and &quot;America&apos;s most fascinating celebrity.&quot; They also claim this is a story of the rise, the fall, and <em>the redemption</em> of the fallen starlet. What do you think they mean by &quot;the redemption&quot;? </p>

<p>In the past few years Lohan hasn&apos;t managed to accomplish much more than breaking her probation, losing her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174630/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/17/carvel_black_card_is_real_lohans_ab.php">Carvel black card</a>, and starring in <em>Labor Pains</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174630/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNvvZ7Bi4es">have you seen <em>Labor Pains</em></a>)? So presumably this redemption they speak of comes from getting naked, thus the headline: Lindsay Reborn.</p>

Check out the entire leaked spread <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174630/http://imgur.com/a/y2PNH#238Al">right here</a> while you can. It&apos;s very Marilyn Monroe (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174630/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/18/lindsay_lohan_r.php">again</a>), if Marilyn Monroe were an airbrushed trainwreck.
