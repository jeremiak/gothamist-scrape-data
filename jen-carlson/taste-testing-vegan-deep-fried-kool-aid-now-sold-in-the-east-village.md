<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2koolaidveganballs0711.JPG" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023224im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/2koolaidveganballs0711.JPG" width="300" height="241" class="image-right"> </span>Today the East Village vegan-friendly spot Cowgirl&apos;s Baking announced via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023224/https://twitter.com/#!/cowgirlsbaking/status/90453361702346752">Twitter</a>: &quot;Our deep-fried Kool-Aid sold out instantly yesterday! We just made a new batch! Come and get it!&quot; Since we do everything that Twitter tells us to, we went right over there and picked up six balls, at $1 a pop. </p>

<p>At first bite the fried Kool-Aid simply tastes like a pretty good doughnut... but then as the hot pink center begins to reveal its own flavors, <em>things change</em>&#x2014;it&apos;s like a sneak attack on the senses. Here&apos;s what the staff at Gothamist HQ was overheard saying upon the taste test (it&apos;s worth noting, however, that people went back for seconds, and the plate is now empty):</p>

<ul><li>It feels like I&apos;m freebasing a Pixie Stick.
</li><li>The texture is good, but it&apos;s so sweet it feels like my teeth are gonna fall out.
</li><li>It does taste just like Kool-Aid... but that&apos;s not good.
</li><li>It tastes like melted Pop Rocks.
</li><li>This is like a subpar munchkin.</li></ul> 

<p>Fried Kool-Aid was the latest fair fare to send the press into a frenzy last month&#x2014;and of course, it got Americans mocked from overseas. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023224/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2005694/Americas-hot-new-snack-deep-fried-Kool-Aid-balls.html">The Daily Mail</a> noted: &quot;America&apos;s latest food craze sets the clock back a thousand years&quot; in healthy eating. But what if they&apos;re <em>vegan</em>?</p>
