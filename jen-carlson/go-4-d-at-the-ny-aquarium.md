The 4-D Immersion Theater includes sensory affects like water mist, a neck air blast, leg ticklers and seat vibrations. All that&apos;s missing is a manatee lap dance! Tickets will range from $9 to $13, and feeling as though you are &quot;gliding alongside a cast of balletic sea lions as they dive through vast swirling bait balls of anchovy&quot; sounds like a nice way to help <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153531/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/08/cutbacks_at_zoo_aquarium_and_botani.php">bail out</a> the aquarium, no?
