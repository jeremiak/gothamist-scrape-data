<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015930/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/private-school-prom-night-from-waldorf-to-hamptons/79187/">The NY Sun</a> reports on the gala event, which will bring together a privileged pack from Collegiate, Browning, Brearley, Hewitt, Spence, and Nightingale-Bamford schools. Dinner, dancing and silver-plated service will all prequel the main event: the after parties.</p><blockquote>People at the Upper East Side school Dalton are planning such a party, complete with a legal waiver parents must sign promising not to sue the hosts should something happen to their children. The after-party is so popular that it has a waiting list, filled with the names of about half the members of the senior class, a source said.</blockquote>Apparently, the exclusive no-fee parties are a far cry from other teens will be doing after their big dances; &quot;prom experts&quot; (really!) report that teens &quot;particularly those in boroughs other than Manhattan&quot; usually end their special night paying to get into a club, heading to the NJ shore or having breakfast at a diner. What about the rich kids whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015930/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/02/wanted_anyone_w.php">parents are crying poor</a>, though?      <p></p>

<p>Fear not, Brooklyn: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015930/http://www.grandprospect.com/">Grand Prospect Hall</a> in Brooklyn hosts prom-goers from Brooklyn Heights&apos; Packer-Collegiate School with red carpets.  But whether you&apos;re Blair Waldorf or what&apos;s-her-name from the wrong side of the bridge, you&apos;ll probably have your night soundtracked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150629015930/http://www.musicsnobbery.com/2008/05/top-prom-songs.html">by Taylor Swift</a>.</p>
