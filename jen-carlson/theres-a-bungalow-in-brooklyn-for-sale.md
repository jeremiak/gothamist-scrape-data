<p>You don&apos;t have to move to Los Angeles to live in a bungalow, there&apos;s one in Brooklyn that just went back on the market. The Windsor Terrace home dates back to 1910, and according to lore may have once been the summer home of a wealthy Brooklyn Heights family. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608223234/http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/real-estate-mysteries-bigger-than-a-shoebox-but-not-much/">Legend has it</a> that when it was under their lock and key it was located in Prospect Park. These days, it&apos;s at 658 Vanderbilt Street. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608223234/http://barbarapuccia.com/property.php?property=sal%C2%ADe&amp;gid=314">the listing</a>, there&apos;s a parking spot, 3 bedrooms, a living room, vaulted ceilings, an eat-in-kitchen, oak floors, and a backyard garden with a &quot;path along the side of the house lined with pavers that guide its seductive flow.&quot; Weird. </p>

<p>Sadly, the listing also states that the old structure can be demolished&#x2014;&quot;We offer an enormous amount of additional FAR, (floor to area ratio) which dictates buildability and this house can be taken down and built 3 floors high!&quot;</p>

<p>All this can be yours for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608223234/http://streeteasy.com/sale/1180392">$1.25 million</a>, and you won&apos;t even have to write a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608223234/http://gothamist.com/tags/goodbyetoallthat">Goodbye To All That</a> essay to live out Hollywood bungalow dreams.
