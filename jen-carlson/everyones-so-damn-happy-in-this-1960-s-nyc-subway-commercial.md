title: Everyone's So Damn Happy In This 1960s NYC Subway Commercial
---

	
										<p>What if everyone on the subway made eye contact and looked genuinely happy? That was the world they created in this ad promoting the subway service for the 1964-1965 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929010932/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldsfair">World&apos;s Fair</a> in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Everyone&apos;s so goddamn happy! Look at this maniac&#x2014;that is some intense #smilespreading.</p>

<p>The cars used for this service were eventually called Redbirds, but they were originally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929010932/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R33_World%27s_Fair_(New_York_City_Subway_car)">painted turquoise</a> (and called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929010932/http://nytransitmuseum.tumblr.com/post/70900842715/r33-bluebird-worlds-fair-car-9306-detail-with">Bluebirds</a>), a color that we would point out invokes more joy (cc: MTA). </p>

<p>The below commercial announces 430 new cars for this service, picking you up from Times Square or Grand Central, and delivering you to the Fair in just 20 minutes. Most of these cars have since been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929010932/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/23/subway_cars_coral_reefs.php">dumped into the ocean</a>, but this advertisement and this man&apos;s haunting cackle will live on forever:</p>
