<p>You have two more chances to see a Manhattanhenge sunset <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325055822/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/manhattanhenge_2015_starts_this_wee.php">this year</a>: tonight and tomorrow night. Try to see at least some of it with your eyes, and not through your phone screen. </p>

<p>The Event&#x2014;which was first named and noticed by Neil deGrasse Tyson&#x2014;happens four times a year, twice with a half sun and twice with a full sun. It occurs when the sunset aligns perfectly with the city&apos;s grid system, illuminating both the north and south sides of every cross street of the borough&apos;s grid. DeGrasse Tyson has called it &quot;a unique urban phenomenon in the world, if not the universe.&quot;</p>

<p>He also has provided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325055822/http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium/resources/manhattanhenge">this tip</a>: &quot;Position yourself as far east in Manhattan as possible. But ensure that when you look west across the avenues you can still see New Jersey. Clear cross streets include 14th, 23rd, 34th. 42nd, 57th, and several streets adjacent to them. The Empire State building and the Chrysler building render 34th street and 42nd streets especially striking vistas.&quot;</p>

<p><u>Full Sun on the Grid</u><br>
Sunday, July 12 8:20 P.M. EDT</p>

<p><u>Half Sun on the Grid</u><br>
Monday, July 13 8:21 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>On Monday night there will also be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325055822/http://www.amnh.org/calendar/manhattanhenge">a Manhattanhenge talk</a> at the American Museum of Natural History, where astrophysicist Jackie Faherty will discuss the history and astronomy behind this fascinating phenomenon in a special presentation at the Hayden Planetarium.</p>
