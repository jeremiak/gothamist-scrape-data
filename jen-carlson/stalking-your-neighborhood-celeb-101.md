										<p>The New York Press is getting their Gawker Stalker on with their latest cover story about stalking Claire Danes...and how you, yes you, can also follow her home! All you need is the internet, a lot of free time and an obsession in which to fuel your fanboy/girl fire. The payoff? Well, for the author of the article, Becca Tucker, it was a cover story complete with creepy photo, headline and font.</p>

<p>Just close your eyes and point at a random part of this article and you&apos;ll likely come up with something that reads like it was ripped from a Brett Easton Ellis novel. Ahem, &quot;She has no idea&#x2014;yet&#x2014;that I know where she lives and where she goes for coffee, certainly neither she nor her bodyguards have the slightest inkling that I&#x2019;ll be waiting for her there.&quot; </p>

<p>The article is also peppered with references to David Ajemian (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309154709/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/09/conan_stalker_f.php">the Conan O&apos;Brien stalker</a>), the history of stalking itself and a timeline of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309154709/http://www.nypress.com/20/49/news&amp;columns/feature2.cfm">famous homicidal stalking incidents</a> -- so it&apos;s pretty amazing that Tucker then goes on to give an instructional on how to find Danes any day of the week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309154709/http://gawker.com/news/gawker-stalker/icms-jeff-berg-flips-out-on-ny-press-for-violating-claire-danes-331526.php">Gawker</a>  suggests the actress embrace her stalk-worthy title, after ICM chairman Jeff Berg (who represents her) stated the article put her &quot;into the gunsights&quot; and (rightfully) got &quot;hostile&quot; with NY Press editor David Blum. </p>
