While many are calling for the prison-themed playground to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811072852/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/03/26/2010-03-26_tear_down_this_jungle_gym.html">torn down</a>, one 5-year-old resident of the Bed-Stuy Tompkins Houses, Destiny, says she likes it because it reminds her of her father (who is in jail for gun possession). <em>Sigh.</em><p></p>

<p>Currently the offensive &quot;JAIL&quot; signage has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811072852/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/playground.php">painted over</a>, with the NYC Housing Authority promising to replace the equipment. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811072852/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/nyregion/26jail.html?ref=nyregion">the NY Times</a>, the agency was at a loss when asked to explain their decision to order and place the set. Spokeswoman Sheila Stainback seemed unsure if there were written accounts of the process, but told the paper the decision typically involves tenant input.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the company that sold the equipment, as well as the non-profit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811072852/http://kaboom.org/">KaBOOM!</a>, have both offered to replace it for free. The CEO of KaBOOM!, which creates playgrounds for poor neighborhoods, says &#x201C;We should be having space playgrounds, so they dream of being an astronaut. You know the game Operation? Imagine how many people played that, then wanted to be a nurse or doctor.&#x201D; So what should the new theme be?</p>
