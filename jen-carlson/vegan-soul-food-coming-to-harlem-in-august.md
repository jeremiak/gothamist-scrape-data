<p>Mother-and-son Brenda and Aaron Beener are aiming to open Harlem&apos;s first full service vegan soul food restaurant this August, but they need your help. The duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050651/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1518430027/seasoned-vegan-a-full-service-vegan-restaurant-in">have launched a Kickstarter</a> in the hopes of raising $20,000 for their new restaurant (previously they seemed to have been selling their food out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050651/http://www.yelp.com/biz/karrot-new-york">now-closed Karrot</a>). They explain:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We have found a great location and we need your help! We are extremely excited about opening the first full service vegan restaurant in Harlem, New York! This project is completely funded by us and we would greatly appreciate your support. Even though our goal is $20,000, of course we are looking to raise as much money as we possibly can. The funds we raise here will go to building our green kitchen.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The restaurant, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050651/http://www.seasonedvegan.com/About-Us.html">Seasoned Vegan</a>, will open its doors in August, and chef Brenda says their menu will be 100% gourmet vegan soul food, adding, &quot;We use the term &apos;soul food&apos; loosely because we are not referring exclusively to the typical cuisine of the Southern region of the United States. For us, soul food is any meal prepared by a chef who not only includes flavorful ingredients but also infuses tender love and care. With that as a founding theme, Seasoned Vegan gives typical Italian, Asian, Middle Eastern, Caribbean and American dishes a vegan, home cooked, soulful twist.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050651/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/meatless-nondairy-soul-food-style-restaurant-set-open-frederick-douglass-blvd-harlem-article-1.1091805#ixzz1xDdsLydm">the Daily News</a>, they plan to open on Frederick Douglass Boulevard near 116th Street (Harlem&apos;s &quot;Restaurant Row&quot;), in an 1,800-square-foot two-story space. The ground floor will be more casual, offering &quot;smoothies and vegan-style alcohol.&#x201D;</p>
