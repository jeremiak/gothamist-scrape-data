<p>So far this year we&apos;re doing terribly in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/tags/etiquette">etiquette</a> department. That guy with the phone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/philharmonic_iphone_disrupter_hasnt.php">at the philharmonic</a>, those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/subway_11.php">teenaged seat hogs</a>, and a shocking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/mr_manners_thinks_upstreaming_is_a-.php">42% of you are upstreamers</a>! Well here comes our latest offender: a tiny dog (at least it wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/and_heres_a_photo_of_an_opossum_rid.php">an opossum</a>?).</p>

<p>Really, the person at blame here is the dog&apos;s owner, a woman who a tipster tells us &quot;refused to give up her dog&apos;s seat to anyone on this crowded ass train.&quot; This was taken last night on the A train somewhere between Canal and Nostrand... but we have to ask: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174113/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/04/lawsuit_to_determine_if_dogs_have_s.php">if puppies have souls</a>, don&apos;t they deserve their own subway seats?</p>
