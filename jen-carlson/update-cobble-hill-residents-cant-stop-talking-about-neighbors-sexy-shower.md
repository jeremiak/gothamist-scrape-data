<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="TALKOFTHEBLOCK.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102409im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/TALKOFTHEBLOCK.jpg" width="323" height="271" class="image-right"> </span><strong>[UPDATE BELOW] </strong>You know what they say about people who live in Brooklyn townhouses with glass showers? <em>Everything.</em> Seriously, if your neighbors can see into a place where you are naked, you will be the talk of the local sewing circle. </p>

<p>Here is the tale of two 30-something lawyers who got married, had three kids, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102409/http://www.incorporatedny.com/album?id=5621097507831904209">renovated a townhouse in Cobble Hill</a>, and invested in keeping their marriage interesting til death do they part by installing a giant glass shower that all the neighbors could see in to. Some people are just <em>into</em> that shit. It doesn&apos;t mean they are bad people or bad lawyers or bad parents or bad neighbors. They were even nice enough to &quot;cut down 3 huge trees so the neighbors could join in the fun.&quot;</p>

<p>But how do we even know about these two and their shower? If there is one thing you can count on in this city, it&apos;s that you are <em>always being watched</em>. One of their neighbors emailed us with some details about the daring duo who are shaking up the quaint block, along with this photo of the &quot;giant fucking glass shower!&quot; Noting, &quot;It looks pretty nice, and I think it can fit a party of 8 at least.&quot; As with all nosy neighbors, our tipster asked to remain anonymous, but she doesn&apos;t really seem to have a problem with the shower. She did tell us, however, that while the couple is &quot;not unattractive, I wish they were hotter and famous.&quot; Everyone&apos;s a critic!</p>

<p>She also tells us that &quot;the other neighbors are all talking about it. You can&apos;t miss it. I think we all thought it was a joke or that there would be curtains, or that it wasn&apos;t really a shower. But it is. And there&apos;s another shower in the window directly above it.&quot; Enjoy the show, you guys&#x2014;and remember, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102409/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/09/peeping_tom_photography_totally_leg.php">it&apos;s totally legal</a> to photograph everything you see going on in there.</p>

<p>Is someone or something the Talk Of <em>Your</em> Block? Feel free to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102409/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tell us all about it</a>, we won&apos;t tell anyone.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102409/http://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/lawyerly-lairs-an-attorneys-attractive-nuisance/2/">Above the Law has discovered</a> that the home is owned by James Cavoli, a litigation partner at Milbank Tweed, and his wife, a reporter for the New York Times. They released this statement: &quot;We are flattered and mildly fascinated that our neighbors have taken an interest in a bathroom that has never been used and is still under construction, and can only hope they will be as friendly when installation of the glass privacy coverings are complete.&quot;</p>
