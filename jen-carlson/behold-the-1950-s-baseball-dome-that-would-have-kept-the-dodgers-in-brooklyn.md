<p>In the mid-1950s, there was a proposal for a new home for the Brooklyn Dodgers, dubbed: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/photo_that_time_a_dome_was_designed.php">the Dodger Dome</a>, which would have sat where the Atlantic Terminal Mall is today, right near Barclays Center. The design came from dome-loving architect Buckminster Fuller, who four years later proposed putting a geodesic dome over much of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/the_1960_plan_to_put_a_dome_over_mi.php">Manhattan</a>. According to a 1955 article in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9504E1DE173DE53ABC4850DFBF66838E649EDE">the NY Times</a>, the Dodgers camp asked Fuller to build them a new home.</p>

<p>Dodgers owner Walter O&apos;Malley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://www.walteromalley.com/biog_short_page4.php?lang=eng">wrote a letter</a> to Fuller on May 26th, 1955, asking specifically for a domed design, and declaring: &#x201C;I am not interested in just building another baseball park.&quot; By the end that year, things were moving forward, and O&apos;Malley told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9404E7DC1E3AE53BBC4B51DFB767838E649EDE">the Times</a>, &quot;I am delighted at the work that has been done. I believe a substantial contribution to the stadium concept has been made. The type of dome Mr. Fuller proposes seems to be quite practical and economical.&quot;</p>

<p>Fuller&apos;s dome&#x2014;which would have been the first of its kind (Houston&apos;s Astrodome wasn&apos;t built for another decade)&#x2014;measured 300 feet high and 750 feet in diameter, but it never moved beyond the preliminary design stage. It was to be located on a 500-acre plot of land in the center of a four square block area near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, and would have included air venting, shadowless lighting fixtures, a huge underground car park with four automobile entrances, a promenade lined with shops, restaurants and other facilities. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/a-dome-grows-in-brooklyn/">Mechanix Illustrated</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Fuller&#x2019;s ball park plan is at present simply a proposal to employ his geodesic dome on a truly grand scale. How many fans it would hold has not yet been figured, but... more than Ebbetts Field, the Brooks&#x2019; hallowed but decaying home park.

<p>The dome design makes feasible the demand for a ball park big enough to hold the enormous Dodger following. It would also be an all-weather, year-round sports palace capable of pulling in big money as a showplace for every kind of sporting event and exposition. The New York State legislature has created a $30,000,000 authority empowered to create such a center and the dome design helped convince the lawmakers that it could be made to pay its own way. </p>

<p>The Dodger Dome would certainly become an object of pride in Brooklyn. It might even rival the borough&#x2019;s ball team in public esteem.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The idea came up around the time O&apos;Malley scoffed at Robert Moses&apos;s idea to build a stadium for the team in Flushing Meadows, Queens, where Shea Stadium was eventually built. </p>

(Still, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/08/gowanus_wall.php#photo-1">better than Gowanus</a>?) O&apos;Malley sold it to a developer in 1956 for $3 million, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://www.southoxford.com/pages/moses.html">told Moses</a>: &quot;If my team is forced to play in the borough of Queens, they will no longer be the Brooklyn Dodgers.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Moses told him: &quot;I just don&apos;t want to see a baseball field in downtown Brooklyn at all. The streets will never handle all the cars. Your domed stadium would create a China Wall of traffic.&quot; Their meeting regarding stadium location was called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/https://books.google.com/books?id=5MNEjiPaGC0C&amp;pg=PT354&amp;lpg=PT354&amp;dq=o%27malley+scoreless+tie+moses&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=slWbSFVjt7&amp;sig=c7pjFiIEj7SFnf-_uYyqPNEmOxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIkpamgsXRyAIVSj0-Ch3aBw4Y#v=onepage&amp;q=o&apos;malley%20scoreless%20tie%20moses&amp;f=false">a scoreless tie</a>&quot; in the papers.</p>

<p>O&apos;Malley kept his options open, though at first didn&apos;t seem keen on relocating the team out of the 5 boroughs, at one point telling L.A. City Councilwoman Rosalind Wyman that he was not interested in meeting. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2013/10/10/34122/roz-wyman-the-woman-that-brought-the-dodgers-to-la/">recalled this</a> a couple of years ago, saying, &quot;I wrote a letter to Walter O&apos;Malley, it&apos;s a famous letter nowadays, and we&apos;d heard he wanted to move from Ebbetts Field. The Dodgers were considered one of the best franchises of any sports in America at the time, and I thought &apos;What the heck?&apos; So I wrote that letter to Walter, and he thought I was just a politician using him.  He wrote me back that he was too busy, but I continued to look around to see who else might be available.  And almost to the day that we voted, I really never thought that we would get the Dodgers.&quot;</p>

<p>But eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Brooklyn_Dodgers#Move_to_California">they did</a>, as &quot;politicians refused to let O&apos;Malley build the Brooklyn stadium he wanted... [and] Los Angeles offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all its revenue streams.&quot; That was something Moses wouldn&apos;t have done, even in Queens it would have been a municipal stadium.</p>

<p>Two years after O&apos;Malley wrote that letter to Wyman, the Dodgers played their last game in Brooklyn (on September 24th, 1957. Their first game in Los Angeles on April 18th, 1958. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710164405/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/mets_dodgers_beer_slip.php">Thanks Robert Moses</a>.</p>
