</div></div>					<p>The latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150122032602/http://www.scoutingny.com/?p=1559">Scouting NY</a> post, where he comes upon a privately owned mansion in Vinegar Hill that used to be part of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, is simply drool-worthy and envy-inducing. The home has received press here and there throughout the years, but as the Scout points out, &quot;the fact that I was unaware of it means there&#x2019;s gotta be one or two readers out there who will be as taken aback by it as I was.&quot; </p>

<p>Located at Evans and Little Street in Brooklyn, just past they mysterious Harrison Alley, the home was built in 1805. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150122032602/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/forgotten14/forgot14.html">Forgotten-NY</a> it was designed by Boston&apos;s Charles Bulfinch, who also designed the U.S. Capitol Building as well as Faneuil Hall in Boston. It was the residence of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150122032602/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry_(naval_officer)">Matthew Perry</a> when he was commanding officer of the shipyard in the 1840s. Since 1964 it&apos;s been privately owned, and while the Scout says the owner is unknown, we hear a doctor has lived there for around 30 years.</p>

<p>Three stories high, balconies, a sprawling lawn, vintage automobiles, views of the East River... sigh. Read more at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150122032602/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/realestate/25scap.html">the NY Times</a>, which profiled the home in 2006... but didn&apos;t get to see the inside either.</p>
