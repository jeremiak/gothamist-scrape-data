<p>You can make a lot of great things with tofu. Tofu meatballs, for instance, are just <em>one</em> of the many delicious things. But did you know you can also make a sweater out of tofu? Gross.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520013035/http://girliegirlarmy.com/blog/20091021/a-sweater-made-out-of-tofu/">Girlie Girl Army</a>, a new fabric uses &quot;the unused protein of soybean oil, tofu and soymilk, this new fabric turns waste into a yarn that possesses cashmere characteristics.&quot; It&apos;s reportedly very soft and not slimey at all. But here&apos;s the catch: the fabric contains 15% Cashmere (and 85% Soybean), so many animal rights activists say it&apos;s inhumane, and not eco-friendly. And no matter how much lemon-ginger marinade you put on it, Cashmere just doesn&apos;t taste good.</p>

<p>The company that uses the tofu cashmere blend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520013035/http://www.shopknitwit.com/about.htm">claims</a> it <em>is</em> eco-friendly, and &quot;uses a renewable natural resource, the unused protein of soybean oil/tofu/soymilk production as a raw material. All byproducts of soybean fiber production are of a harmless nature.&quot; But the Girlie Girl Army says, &quot;duh, using animals in production is never green.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520013035/http://www.peta.org/issues/Animals-Used-for-Clothing/inside-the-wool-industry.aspx">PETA</a> explains: &quot;It may be called cashmere... but any kind of wool means suffering for animals.&quot;</p>
