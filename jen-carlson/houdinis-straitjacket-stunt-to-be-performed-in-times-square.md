At 1:26 p.m. (the exact moment Houdini died 86 years ago) sideshow performer Albert Cadabra will execute Houdini&#x2019;s infamous suspended straitjacket escape. You can watch Houdini perform this in the below video: <br>

<p>Cadabra will be suspended 35 feet in the air from the lobby ceiling of Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not! Times Square&#x2014;which is 10 feet lower than Houdini when he first performed the stunt in 1915 (though it&apos;s unclear how high he was when he performed it again, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703222529/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/happy_birthday_harry_houdini.php#photo-2">in NYC</a>). Once up there, he&apos;ll hang by his ankles, and attempt a full escape from the restraints of a regulation straitjacket. </p>

<p>Or you could pay homage by going to Houdini&apos;s old digs on 113th Street and performing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703222529/http://rense.com/general15/houd.htm">a s&#xE9;ance</a>.</p>
