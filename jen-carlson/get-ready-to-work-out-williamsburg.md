It looks like soon enough the void will be filled, enter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150202101628/http://somahealthclub.com/">Soma Health Club</a>. </p>

<p>A call inquiring about fees has not been returned yet, but expect to pay more than you would at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150202101628/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/recreation_centers/view_recreation_center.php?ID=B085">Metropolitan Pool &amp; Fitness Center</a>. Housed in an old theater located at 107 South 6th Street here&apos;s what we do know so far about the &quot;full-service luxury health club&quot;: </p>

<ul>
<li>16,000 square feet of loft-style floor space
</li><li>State-of-the-art spin room
</li><li>Private yoga room
</li><li>Atrium stretch room
</li><li>Sauna and steam rooms
</li></ul>

<p>We walked by and the construction fence is now down, with tons of promo encouraging &quot;early registration&quot; in the windows (they&apos;ve also been flyering cars all around the neighborhood). Soma is poised to open in January 2008 -- just in time for those New Year&apos;s resolutions!</p>
