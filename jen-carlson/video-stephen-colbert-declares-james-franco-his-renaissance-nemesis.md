title: Video: Stephen Colbert Declares James Franco His "Renaissance Nemesis"
---

<p>Last night America&apos;s Overachiever, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110428192905/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a>, faced off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110428192905/http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/tue-april-5-2011-james-franco?fbid=7kUYuyubngD">with Stephen Colbert</a>&#x2014;who called the actor his &quot;renaissance nemesis,&quot; or &quot;renainemesis.&quot; In the below videos watch as James easily manipulates Colbert with his dashing smile and Tolkien knowledge&#x2014;he eventually even convinces the host to hire him as the show&apos;s art consultant.</p>

<p>The smarts run in the family, it seems, as Franco&apos;s twin brother Frank Jameso also makes an appearance; he poses a question to Colbert, and America, asking if his brother is really <em>all that</em>, or rather, &quot;Is modern America so intellectually bankrupt, that anyone pursuing any cultural enrichment of any kind makes him seem intellectual?&quot; (A: yes.)</p>
