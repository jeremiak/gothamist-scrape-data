<p>The latest coming to us from the etiquette-abandoning bowels of New York is a photograph of this man, sitting spread eagle on a much-coveted rush hour subway seat. Our tipster tells us this was taken just after 6 p.m. yesterday evening, on the R train uptown. At least this offender took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301223429/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/30/psa_please_stop_wearing_backpacks_o.php">his backpack off</a> so (once upright again) it wouldn&apos;t knock into fellow straphangers, but let&apos;s not get sidetracked here. This is a real problem, and while they do love to spread their legs wide open like the whole world&apos;s between their knees, public enemy #1 <em>isn&apos;t</em> just man.</p>

<p>In fact, at the same time the above photo was taken on the R, another tipster spotted this woman on the downtown 4/5 yesterday evening. Coincidence? <em>Psychic phenomena</em>? Or just proof that more New Yorkers than not abandon all manners once they get underground? We&apos;re told this woman was not only eating on the subway, but left her garbage behind, which included spilled milk.</p>
