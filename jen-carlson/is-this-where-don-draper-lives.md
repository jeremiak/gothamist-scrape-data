<p>In the season premiere of <em>Mad Men</em>, Don Draper is set up in his new city digs (circa <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170309/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/26/mad_men_3.php">1964</a>)&#x2014;which we find out is in the vicinity of Waverly Place and 6th Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170309/http://trueslant.com/lewisgrossberger/2010/07/27/don-draper-i-know-where-you-live/">True/Slant</a> set itself upon a mission this week to find out the exact address where the ad man lives in season 4, and they&apos;re pretty certain it&apos;s at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170309/http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=136+Waverly+Place&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=136+Waverly+Pl,+New+York,+NY+10014&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=lVZQTIroJIP-8AbSsK2RAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ8gEwAA">136 Waverly Place</a>. The 16-story apartment building&#x2014;better known as The Waverly&#x2014;was built in 1928, and still stands today.</p>

<p>The True/Slant team visited the apartment building (but neglected to take photos!), and report back saying, &quot;It had the right look. Old, discreet, maybe 100 apartments, faded yellow brick facade, just off the corner, southwest side. The lobby&#x2019;s dark, art-decoish, with a diamond-pattern floor.&quot; They also note that in the early &#x2018;60s rent there was probably a couple hundred a month (currently, a one-bedroom goes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170309/http://www.halstead.com/detail.aspx?id=1844034">$769,000</a>; a three-bedroom goes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170309/http://www.stribling.com/propinfo.asp?webid=1155398&amp;type=SALE">$3.7MM</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170309/http://blogs.amctv.com/mad-men/talk/2010/07/dons-apartment.php">Fans of the show</a> don&apos;t seem very fond of Don&apos;s new place&#x2014;calling it &quot;terribly depressing&quot; and labeling it a man cave. But taste aside, do you think it could be at 136 Waverly? The <em>Mad Men</em> team are sticklers for detail, and the windows seem very off&#x2014;it almost looks like Mr. Draper may have a balcony (or at least windows almost down to the floor), which The Waverly doesn&apos;t have. (More shots of the apartment in the first episde, which you can watch in full below.)</p>
