										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="FREECONEDAY0411.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430232016im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/FREECONEDAY0411.jpg" width="365" height="383" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s that special time of year again, where you can wait in absurdly long lines in an effort to save a few bucks. Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s will be hosting another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430232016/http://www.benjerry.com/scoop-shops/feature/free-cone-day/">Free Cone Day</a> tomorrow, and you can get your free frozen treat from noon to 8 p.m. We called the Rockefeller Center shop today and they told us the cone you&apos;d be getting is normally &quot;$3.25 plus tax,&quot; but other locations &quot;may be cheaper.&quot; If you hit up several shops throughout the day, you can double... triple... quadruple these savings! </p>

<p>If you&apos;re really going to go for it, you might as well try a different flavor at each stop. Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s points to their newer flavors: Bonnaroo Buzz, Stephen Colbert&#x2019;s AmeriCone Dream, ClusterFluff, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430232016/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/jimmy_fallon_immortalized_in_ben_je.php">Late Night Snack</a> (which has potato chips in it).</p>

<p>And if you are planning on making more than one stop by the shop tomorrow, we suggest you wear elastic waist pants, and take the stairs whenever possible.</p>
