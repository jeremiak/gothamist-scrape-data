title: Video: Ye Olde Bushwick Gang Footage
---

<p>Street gangs used to have <em>way</em> cooler names &#x2014; like, say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719161311/http://www.classicnystreetgangs.com/thedevilsrebels.htm">the Devil&apos;s Rebels</a> for instance. Now there&apos;s some amazing footage that&apos;s resurfaced of the &apos;70s Bushwick gang, originally broadcast as part of a 1976 newscast. The footage was allegedly captured using a night vision lens and concealed cameras, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719161311/http://bushwickbk.com/2009/11/10/70s-bushwick-street-gang-video-resurfaces/">Bushwick BK</a> notes that it all goes down in the 83rd Precinct, &quot;a battleground for the police and young street criminals, where a teenage gang roams the streets at night looking for trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;d prefer those baseball bats and lead pipes over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719161311/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/12/stabbings.php">machetes</a>.</p>
