	<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154929/http://gothamist.com/tags/phish">Phish</a> has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154929/http://phish.com/summer2013/">announced their summer tour</a> through a dark, <em>Apocalypse Now</em>-themed short film, starring drummer Jon Fishman as Benjamin L. Willard, revealing the dates with a near shot-for-shot homage to the movie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154929/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEgqIY7xgtE">opening scenes</a>. In it, Fishman gazes off into the distance, talking about going on tour as if he were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154929/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__xO5eBpZEQ">the king from some forgotten war</a>. &quot;Burlington,&quot; says Fishman, squinting out through venetian blinds. &quot;Shit. I&apos;m still only in Burlington.&quot;:</p>

<p>So if Mike is Charlie does this mean <em>Trey is Kurtz? </em> The tour starts in Bangor, Maine on July 3rd, followed by a three-night stand at Saratoga Performing Arts Center on July 5 through 7th, and then they&apos;ll hit Canada for the first time in <em>thirteen years</em>. After that it&apos;s Holmdel, NJ; Wantagh, NY (Jones Beach); Maryland; Georgia;  Northerly Island in Chicago; George, WA; Stateline, NV; San Francisco; Los Angeles; and Commerce City, CO. Tickets will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154929/http://tickets.phish.com/">go on sale</a> to the general public beginning March 29th and 30th. Sadly, looks like that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154929/http://phantasytour.com/bands/1/topics/3362474/posts?page=1">rumored Poconos weekend festival</a> was <em>just a rumor</em>.</p>
