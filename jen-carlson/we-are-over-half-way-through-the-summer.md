<p>Good news for those also suffering through reverse seasonal affective disorder: we are over halfway through the sweltering summer months! According to our calculations, this past Saturday was the half-way point through the season, which so far has brought a brutal heatwave and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183620/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/where_the_f_is_the_ac_on_the_c_trai.php">broken subway air conditioners</a>. Sure, we&apos;ll soon be complaining about the cold <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183620/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/reminder_soon_well_be_complaining_a.php">once again</a>, while we ponder new ways to say &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183620/http://gothamist.com/tags/snowmageddon">snowmageddon</a>,&quot; and compile our Top Five <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183620/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/13/let_me_drink_ne.php">Fireplace Bars</a> list... but it&apos;s still nice to know that we&apos;re half way through this thing.</p>

<p>For those counting down: we&apos;ve got 136 days until the first day of winter. Or another way of looking at it, if we were in <em>Dazed and Confused</em>, we&apos;d be about here right now:</p>
