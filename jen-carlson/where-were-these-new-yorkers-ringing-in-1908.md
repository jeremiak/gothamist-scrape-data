<p>Here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201172200/http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3798672880/">December 29th, 1907</a> edition of the New-York Tribune, which featured a scene from New Year&apos;s Eve (odd, with it being two days later an all). The paper, which singled out the &quot;Good Americans&quot; as the recipients of their well wishes, wrote: </p><blockquote>&quot;Scene in a popular New York restaurant where the first hours of January are regularly ushered in with much merriment and good cheer. Just before midnight every light in the brilliantly illuminated place suddenly goes out. All sit in darkness for a moment and in such silence that nearby church bells can be heard ringing in the new year. Up go the lights again and all spring to their feet and drink a toast to Father Time&apos;s latest baby. The Christmas decorations are left in position until after the holidays.&quot;</blockquote>What massive restaurant do you think they were in?<p></p>
