title: Photos: Behind That 1920s Selfie Taken On A NYC Rooftop
---

	
										<p>A couple of years ago we unearthed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060658/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/09/photo_is_this_the_first_selfie.php">this old 1920s-era selfie</a> in the MCNY archives:</p>

<p>The photo was taken in 1920 on a New York City rooftop, and while we originally thought this was at 285 Fifth Avenue, between 30th and 31st Streets, it&apos;s noted (on the below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060658/http://collections.mcny.org/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult_VPage&amp;VBID=24UP1GVKB8UO&amp;SMLS=1">new-to-us photo</a>) that St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral is in the background, so it was further uptown. The caption reads: &quot;Five photographers posing together for a photograph on the roof of Marceau&apos;s Studio, while Joseph Byron holds one side of the camera with his right hand and Ben Falk holds the other side with his left hand.&quot; <em>When we took selfies, we had to use two people&apos;s hands to hold the camera steady.</em></p>

<p>The above shot, capturing how this was done, was just included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060658/http://mcnyblog.org/2013/02/26/the-photographers-mirror-2/">in the MCNY&apos;s post</a> about the photographer&apos;s relationship with New York City. In the piece, they note: &quot;Occupational self-portraits proclaim a new profession independent from tradition. Images of photographers taken by photographers illustrate a developing self-awareness, an inventiveness and an introspection at once calculating and as casual as the experience of noticing one&#x2019;s reflection in a shop window.&quot; This particular shot features Uncle Joe Byron, Pirie MacDonald, Colonel Marceau, Pop Core, and Ben Falk... who didn&apos;t have any social media to share their experiment on.</p>

<p>Of course, it wasn&apos;t in New York that the First Ever Selfie was taken (though will we ever <em>really</em> know?)&#x2014;Robert Cornelius took one in Philly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060658/http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/robert-cornelius-self-portrait-the-first-ever-selfie-1839/">in 1839</a>, and teenage Russian princess Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova took one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060658/http://www.news.com.au/technology/these-old-selfies-dating-back-to-the-1800s-will-blow-your-mind/story-e6frfro0-1226741497253">in 1914</a>.</p>
