Craig Zucker is the man behind the idea, a for-profit business that gets its product from the city&apos;s public water system &quot;to source the world&apos;s best tasting tap water, purify it through reverse osmosis and bottle it locally, leaving out ludicrous transportation miles.&quot; Zucker told us a little bit about his idea, future &quot;water pairings&quot; taking place around the city, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea for Tap&apos;dNY?</strong> It started with the idea that, contrary to what Coke/Pepsi/Fiji and the rest would want you to believe, there&apos;s nothing wrong with our local water (certainly nothing worth shipping in someone else&apos;s water from 8000+ miles away, or sending your dollars to Fiji and France $2 at a time for). Add to that the question &quot;what would a completely honest bottled water look like?&quot; and all of the sudden people getting really excited.</p>

<p><strong>How do you purify the water before bottling it?</strong> You think I&apos;m filling them at my sink, don&apos;t you? We&apos;re bottling 100s per minute at a local bottler. The purification process is called reverse osmosis. It&apos;s a wee bit scientific, but essentially we start with award winning water (New York&apos;s) then purify the hell out of it.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think that bottled water has a different taste from NYC tap water?</strong> NYC tap water has chlorine in it. You can taste it. By the time we&apos;re done though people can&apos;t seem to work out which is ours and which is Fiji. Try it for yourself. If you can&apos;t tell the difference, isn&apos;t it better to buy local?</p>

<p><strong>What are some of the biggest myths about tap water?</strong> The main myth is that it&apos;s dirty. New York City is one of only 5 major cities in the country that comes from such a pure source that the EPA doesn&apos;t require filtering at all. It comes from upstate, on it&apos;s own power (the whole system is on a slope) and it&apos;s pretty good. If you&apos;re seeing discoloration or other impurities, it&apos;s probably taking place in the last 100 feet. The pipes inside your building aren&apos;t always the best.</p>
