<p>This afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063337/http://gothamist.com/tags/billcosby">Bill Cosby</a> appeared at the Montgomery County Courthouse, where he was arraigned for indecent assault. Assistant DA Kevin Steele explained in a press conference this morning that the charge is brought when &quot;a person commits some type of vaginal penetration, and the person does so without consent,&quot; in many cases because &quot;the person was unconscious or unaware&quot; or &quot;substantially impaired.&quot; He added, &quot;We know pills were provided, we know there was wine that was provided.&quot; </p>

<p>While over 50 women have accused Cosby of sexual assault, this charge is in regards to the alleged 2004 sexual assault <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063337/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/billy_cosby_arrest_rape.php">of Andrea Constand</a>. However, attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 29 alleged victims of Cosby, just held a press conference in Los Angeles &quot;to react to the charges filed against Mr. Cosby,&quot; a release stated. We&apos;ll have more at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063337/http://laist.com/">LAist</a> when the conference has concluded, but we hear Allred has said she will likely make her clients available in this case. (UPDATE: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063337/http://laist.com/2015/12/30/cosby_charges_allred.php">Here&apos;s more from Allred&apos;s press conference</a>.)</p>

<p>Constand&apos;s lawyer, Dolores Troiani, stated today: &quot;We wish to express our appreciation to the Montgomery County District Attorney&apos;s Office, the County Detectives and the Cheltenham Police Department for the consideration and courtesy they have shown Andrea during this difficult time.&quot;</p>

<p>Cosby&apos;s hearing concluded just before 3 p.m., only lasting about 10 minutes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063337/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bill-cosby-scandal/bill-cosby-criminally-charged-2004-sex-assault-case-n487876">Press on hand</a> noted that he was &quot;dazed and fragile.&quot; The 78-year-old was read his charges, granted bail at $1 million, and was instructed to hand his passport over. Right now he&apos;s on his way to the station to get fingerprinted and have his mug shot taken [UPDATE: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031063337/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/bill_cosby_mug_shot.php">Here&apos;s Cosby&apos;s mug shot</a>]. More on that as it becomes available, but for now here&apos;s another look at Cosby as he entered the courthouse:</p>

<p>There is a 12 year statute of limitations in Pennsylvania, which allowed until January 1st, 2016 for charges to be brought against Cosby in the Constand case. &quot;Reopening the case was not a question, reopening this case was our duty as law enforcement officers,&quot; Steele told the press this morning.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the court docket from today:</p>
