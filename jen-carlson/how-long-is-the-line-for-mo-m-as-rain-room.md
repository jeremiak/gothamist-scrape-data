<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/photos_walk_between_the_raindrops_a.php">MoMA&apos;s Rain Room</a> closing on July 28th, the panicked rush to experience it is hitting, and the already long lines are probably going to get worse over the next few weeks. (Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/http://gothamist.com/tags/savagebeauty">Alexander McQueen&apos;s Savage Beauty</a> line at The Met?)</p>

<p>Since opening in mid-May, the wait times have gone from around 30 minutes to a max of about <em>8 hours</em>&#x2014;at this point, if you&apos;re lucky you&apos;ll &quot;only&quot; wait about 4 hours <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/how_to_wait_on_line.php">on line</a>. This is according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/http://danwin.com/2013/07/a-guide-to-waiting-around-for-the-momas-rain-room/">one very detailed log</a> that includes a crowdsourced table of wait times. On July 4th, MoMA reported a 4 to 5 hour wait time, on a non-holiday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/https://twitter.com/MuseumModernArt/status/350639785502703619">they reported</a> a 7 to 8 hour wait time. </p>

<p>Is it worth it? Gothamist&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/http://twitter.com/johndelsignore">John Del Signore</a> has been inside and says, &quot;I think it&apos;s maybe worth waiting an hour for, if you have a book.&quot;</p>

<p>Some things you should know: <br>
</p><ul><li>While the Rain Room is dark and... rainy, the line you&apos;ll be standing in for hours and hours is going to be sunlit and hot, so bring an umbrella for shade, pile on some sunscreen, and be prepared to sweat.<br>
</li><li>The actual Rain Room can only accommodate about 10 people at a time.<br>
</li><li>While the museum politely suggests you only stay in there for 10 minutes, it was mandated by the artists, Random International, that visitors be able to stay as long as they want.<br>
</li><li>For your best shot at getting in after only a few hours on line, you&apos;ll want to get there by 6:30 a.m., around the same time you&apos;d get on line for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronuts">Cronuts</a>.<br>
</li><li>Some people have been purchasing memberships just for the line advantage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152106/http://www.moma.org/support/membership/categories">you can do so for $85+</a>, and your membership will include $5 guest tickets.<br>
</li><li>It will cost the standard MoMA admission price to get in: $25.<br>
</li><li>MoMA&apos;s hours are: Monday through Thursday, and Saturday and Sunday, 10:30am to 5:30pm; with extended hours on Thursday and Friday to 8 p.m.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to MoMA for their own tips on the Rain Room experience, as well as some questions, and will update when we hear back.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&apos;re told that the line gets cut off in the early afternoon, so sometime around 2 p.m. you won&apos;t even be allowed to get on line. A MoMA rep has also told us that average wait times for members on weekdays is 2-3 hours and 4-5 hours for general public ticket holders.  The wait increases on the weekends by at least one hour. </p>

<p>There is a newly added &quot;view only&quot; line, and the wait time for that is just 15 minutes. This &quot;allows one to walk through and observe the installation from the side.&quot;</p>
