<p>During a live taping of WNYC&apos;s Soundcheck on February 27th, taking place at The Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, an important debate will be held: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214328/http://www.nypl.org/events/programs/2014/02/27/soundcheck-wnyc-presents-soundcheck-smackdown-%E2%80%9Cbeatles-vs-rolling-stones%E2%80%9D">Beatles vs. Rolling Stones</a>. And for some reason, Mike Myers will be there. </p>

<p>Myers will be taking the side of the Beatles, along with Paul Myers (musician and music writer). They&apos;ll be going head-to-head with comedian Ophira Eisenberg and Bill Janovitz (front man of Buffalo Tom). If those with sense and taste in this world were also gifted with the power to debate, then future generations will cite this evening as one the time it was finally declared, forever, that the Rolling Stones have like, ten good songs... TOPS. Granted, they are very good songs (maybe one of the Beatles wrote them for them?), but with the possible exception of <em>Exile on Main Street</em>, the Stones have no full album masterpieces, of which the Beatles had several. No matter what that NY Times reviewer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214328/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/26/ny_times_reviews_abbey_road_in_1969.php">declared in 1969</a>.</p>

<p>We wouldn&apos;t just make this bold claim if we didn&apos;t have evidence. Exhibits A, B, and C in our case against the Stones: </p>

<p>And for the Beatles&#x2014;who have much more emotional range&#x2014;exhibits A, B, and C: </p>
