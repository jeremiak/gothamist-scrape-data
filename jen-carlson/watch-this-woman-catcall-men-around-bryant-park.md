<p>What if... women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917163957/http://gothamist.com/tags/streetharassment">catcalled</a> men? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917163957/https://www.facebook.com/events/439810779512563/">Two comedians</a> recently gave it a shot&#x2014;one filming the other from a distance as she approached men around Bryant Park, whispering sweet nothings into their unprepared ears. </p>

<p>&quot;I want to destroy your dick,&quot; SJ Son tells one bro. &quot;That&apos;s a fine ass,&quot; she tells another. Were the men horrified? Scared? Disgusted? Nope. The catcalls only made their smiles broader, and egos larger. But it&apos;s important to keep in mind that in this scenario, the men were not walking home at night, alone, on a mostly empty street, in a city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917163957/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/08/nypd_releases_video_of_suspected_st_2.php">populated by violent predators</a>. </p>

<p>Ginny Leise told us this morning, &quot;We spent about an hour in the park and approached a total of 20 men,&quot; adding that it was all &quot;100% authentic, we didn&apos;t approach anyone ahead of time/afterwards.&quot;</p>
