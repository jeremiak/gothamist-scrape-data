</div></div>					<p>This morning the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135150/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypl">New York Public Library</a> cut the ribbon on their brand new Battery Park City Library, which also happens to be the first green library in Manhattan. Their 88th branch, located at 175 North End Avenue, is about 10,000-square-feet and has a pricetag of $6.7 million. The branch is expected to receive LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, and inside you&apos;ll find:</p>

<ul><li>An efficient technologically advanced low-energy heating/cooling system 
</li><li>Low-flow sanitary fixtures which reduce water consumption
</li><li>Low-energy lighting system
</li><li>Use of recycled and renewable building materials including a wood floor constructed with off-cuts from window frame manufacture, carpets constructed from old truck tires, millwork made from recycled cardboard composite, and terrazzo with recycled glass and mirror aggregate
</li><li>The inclusion of a dedicated area for the collection and storage of all recyclable materials accumulated during the day to day operations of the branch
</li><li>Use of a large number of the products that are low emitting in order to help the overall indoor air quality</li></ul> 

<p>On top of all that, there are a total of 24,000 items, 36 public access computers, separate reading areas for children, young adults, and adults, as well as a multipurpose programming room on the second floor, and two self-checkout machines. </p>

<p>It is now open to the public, and today they&apos;ll be hosting free events. Regular library hours will be: Monday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Tuesday, 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.; Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursday, 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
