---

	
										<p>The below video is making the rounds today (and, no, it&apos;s not an April Fool&apos;s joke), which shows a woman giving a tour of her studio apartment... all 90-square-feet of it. That&apos;s smaller than the previously proclaimed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131030/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/07/small_apt.php">smallest apartment in New York</a>!

<p>Should we be scared that current living spaces in the city make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131030/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0fBOPPERGE">the Bratter&apos;s apartment</a> look like a mansion in the sky?
