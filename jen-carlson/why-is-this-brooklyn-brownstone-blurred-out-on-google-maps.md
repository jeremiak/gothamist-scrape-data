<p>There are a lot of theories floating around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142147/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/18z4pz/anybody_know_why_this_house_in_brooklyn_is/">on Reddit</a> about why this building at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142147/https://www.google.com/maps?ll=40.688587,-73.969949&amp;spn=0.006581,0.009645&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.688701,-73.969971&amp;panoid=A0XRJUfIvT3vyx0_RdMZ-Q&amp;cbp=12,105.19,,0,-14.12">291 Clermont Avenue in Brooklyn</a> is blurred out on Google maps&#x2014;from there being naked people in the windows of the home, to the cover-up of a Sasquatch sighting. We asked Google what was up with the digital curtain, and a spokesperson told us:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We automatically blur faces and license plates that appear in Street View, and also provide an easy-to-use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142147/http://www.google.com/help/maps/streetview/privacy.html">reporting tools</a> so that people can ask for images of their house, car or themselves to be further obscured. They can simply click on &apos;Report a problem&apos; on the bottom left-hand side of the Street View image to submit a request that our team will review and take action upon as needed. In this case, we likely received a request from the person living here to blur their home.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>But will this move just set off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">the Streisand Effect</a>?</p>
