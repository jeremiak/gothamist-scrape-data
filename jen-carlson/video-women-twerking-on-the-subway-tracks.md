<p>Not to sound like An Old, but ladies ladies ladies... <em>what are you doing here?</em> Maybe it&apos;s time to join an afterschool program, or take up the French horn (great way to get a scholarship), or just make new friends, or do literally anything else but twerk on the subway tracks while some dude films you for The Internet. </p>

<p>While neither of these young women (who clearly didn&apos;t want their faces on film) twerked on to the third rail, and everyone left unscathed (presumably!), this is still youthful idiocy at its finest. And it&apos;s not even &quot;cool&quot;... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504005347/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/06/video_miley_cyrus_on_the_subway_tra.php">Miley Cyrus did it in August</a> for media conglomerate Viacom. Albeit, probably on a sound stage where a subway couldn&apos;t come barreling down the tunnel, crushing her before she ever had a chance to really live, feel what it&apos;s like to have hope and love and everything good in life... seriously, ladies! Stop.</p>
