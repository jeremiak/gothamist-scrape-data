										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smlennonono1011.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151649im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smlennonono1011.jpg" width="350" height="254" class="image-right"> </span>Yoko Ono will briefly depart her digs at the Dakota for a move down to Wooster Street. She&apos;s leasing a 10,000-square foot brick building at 76 Wooster Street (between Spring and Broome) for a celebration of what would have been John Lennon&apos;s 71st birthday. And you&apos;re invited over.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151649/http://www.observer.com/2011/10/yoko-ono-comes-to-soho-for-john-lennons-71st-birthday/">the Observer</a>, the visual tribute to her late husband (called Gimme Some Truth) will be on view from October 7th to 10th, and the space will house Lennon&apos;s artwork... which you can buy (this is to benefit Citymeals-on-Wheels). The 100 pieces were created by Lennon between 1964 and 1980.</p>

<blockquote>The artwork for sale consists of lithographs, seriographs and copper etchings of the pen, pencil and Japanese sumi ink drawings of John Lennon, and each are &#x201C;signed&#x201D; in the Japanese tradition with Mr. Lennon&#x2019;s &#x201C;chop,&#x201D; a personalized red stamp which in his case reads &#x201C;Like a Cloud, Beautiful Sound.&#x201D; Also available are lithographs of some rare Bag One drawings, the portfolio of wedding drawings and controversial erotic works (some depicting himself and his wife), which Mr. Lennon gave Ms. Ono at their wedding.</blockquote>

<p>Bonus: the building was reportedly &quot;a reclusive hideout of Andy Warhol years ago.&quot; The gallery hours are: <br>
</p><ul><li>Friday, October 7th: Noon to 9 p.m.<br>
</li><li>Saturday, October 8th: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.<br>
</li><li>Sunday, October 9th: 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (John&#x2019;s birthday)<br>
</li><li>Monday, October 10th: 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Ono is also prepping to light the Imagine Peace tower in Reykjavik again, on October 9th you can see it live <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151649/http://imaginepeacetower.com/">here</a>. </p>

<p>Fun fact: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151649/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/travel-tips-and-articles/76327">did you know that</a> &quot;for fresh air, perhaps, Lennon &#x2018;did the Staten Island Ferry&apos;&quot;?</p>
