<p>With season two not even on the air yet, there were rumors flying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302031330/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/19/jersey_shore_cast_on_strike.php">Monday</a> that the cast of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302031330/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> were striking over problems with their new contract for <em>season three</em>&#x2014;but the crisis has been averted everyone! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302031330/http://www.tmz.com/2010/07/20/jersey-shore-contract-negotiations-the-situation-snooki-season-3-mtv/">TMZ</a> reports that the cast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302031330/http://tvwatch.people.com/2010/07/21/jersey-shore-season-3-strike-raise/">got their raise</a> and will indeed be returning to Seaside Heights again next year. PHEW. The gossip site also claims that Angelina&#x2014;who was sent home early during season one&#x2014;won&apos;t be returning with them (maybe that was a contract demand!).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302031330/http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/21/jersey-shore-cast-on-for-season-3-maybe-jealous-of-snooki/">CNN</a> (yes, CNN) reports that there may be some tension between the remaining cast members. Nicole &#x201C;Snooki&#x201D; Polizzi and Mike &#x201C;The Sitaution&#x201D; Sorrentino could be getting too big for the Shore&#x2014;or at least their egos may be. Snooks says, &quot;I know the others want the same opportunities that Mike and I get, but we don&#x2019;t control those things. The media isn&apos;t asking for the others so they can&apos;t really be mad at me. I can understand why they might be jealous. They aren&apos;t doing anything, but they should still be happy for me.&quot; Oooh, maybe for season three MTV should make the rest of the cast be Snooki and the Situation&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302031330/http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheVirgin.htm">personal butlers</a>.</p>
