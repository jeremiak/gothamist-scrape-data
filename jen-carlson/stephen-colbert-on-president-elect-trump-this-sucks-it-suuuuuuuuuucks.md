<p>Late night talk show hosts just got four years of material they never wanted. Donald Trump will be our next President, and Colbert is almost physically losing his voice he&apos;s got so much to say about it. Where Seth Meyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022733/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/video_seth_meyers_trump.php">tried to be nice</a>, Colbert is giving it to us straight: this sucks. Last night, he delivered a 16-minute post mortem of election season and America as we know it. </p>

<blockquote>I&apos;m not sure what to believe about anything anymore. I wouldn&apos;t want to be alone right now. 

<p>We&apos;ve got four very interesting years in front of us. I don&apos;t know about you but I did not get a lot of sleep last night. There&apos;s no way around it, this is what it feels like when America&apos;s Great Again. I was hoping it would feel better, because this sucks. It suuuuucks. We have to accept that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States. It&apos;s like a dream state... all day I&apos;ve had to remind myself this is real. </p>

<p>Whatever the GOP is saying, I have a feeling they might be feeling the same way. Because remember, the Republican party spent almost the entirety of this election in panic, trying to stop Trump from becoming their nominee. </p>

<p>You know who <em>is</em> taking this strangely well? Hillary Clinton. Even though the possible first female president lost to a crotch-grabbing beauty pageant owner. How are you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114022733/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/clinton_concession_speech.php">already accepting this</a>? Did you pay extra for the fast pass through the five stages of grief? Acceptance is the last one.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>He also addressed those who are talking about moving to Canada, telling them not to get up from the dinner table: &quot;You don&apos;t get to flee the country when things get rough here, being an American citizen is like being family.&quot;</p>

<p>Later in the show, Triumph the Dog showed up, explaining why we didn&apos;t see these results coming: &quot;It&apos;s the elitists that didn&apos;t see it. You underestimated Trump. You underestimated the voters... people are blaming the election on voters being &apos;stupid,&apos; which I think is very unfair to the racists.&quot;<br>
