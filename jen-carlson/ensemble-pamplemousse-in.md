</p><p>This week Gothamist is particularly excited about a performance a bit different from what&apos;s normally on our concert schedule. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811115635/http://www.safetgallery.com/DUBuQuE/BiosPamp.html"><b>Ensemble Pamplemousse</b></a>, a 10 person musical troupe, has been described as &apos;extremely forward looking&apos; and &apos;breathtakingly virtuosic&apos;, however we&apos;re pretty certain that words can&apos;t describe what will take place during their three performances later this week, nor would a word do it justice. Some of New York City&apos;s finest composers will collaborate with Swedish artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811115635/http://www.peterkohler.info.se/">Peter K&#xF6;hler</a> to bring you an aurally and visually stimulating experience; a unification of the senses. Each person and action triggering another, coming full circle in a performance quite unlike any you have seen. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811115635/http://www.safetgallery.com/DUBuQuE/BiosPamp.html">Ensemble Pamplemousse</a> is: <b>Natacha Diels</b>  (flutes, piccolo and electronics), <b>Julie Ferrara</b>  (oboe), <b>Argeo Ascani</b>  (saxaphones), <b>Eddie Burns</b>  (bassoon), <b>Ari Korn</b> (horn), <b>Kiku Enomoto</b>  and <b>Monica Davis</b>  (violins), <b>Korrina Lynch</b>  (viola), <b>Laura Usiskin</b> (cello) and <b>Andrew Greenwald</b> (drumset etc.).</p>

<p>Composer and Artistic Director, <b>Rama Gottfried</b>, took some time out to answer our questions this week...</p>

<p><b>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</b> <br>
Ensemble Pamplemousse was Natachas concoction.  The grapefruit:  acidic on the outside, succulent and refreshing on the inside.  (She speaks french).</p>

<p><b>Your great-granduncle, Earl Moss, was the head arranger for Radio City Music Hall, your great-grandmother Alberta Boutyette gave Andy Warhol his first gallery show...it seems as though NYC, as well as a creative passion, must run through your bloodline. Do you ever search your family genealogy for inspiration? </b> <br>
All the time.  It can be a little intimidating to live up to at times, but I love to think back imagining my circus family.  My other great-grandmother was an aerialist who spun through the air hanging by her teeth, meanwhile my great-grandfather was balancing on his fathers head and doing countless flips on the trampoline.  The whole scene is just so colorful and wild. All my life Ive had this odd fascination with fantastic theater.  Its endlessly inspiring.  </p>
