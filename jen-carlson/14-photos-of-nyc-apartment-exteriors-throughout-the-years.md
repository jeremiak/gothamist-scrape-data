</div></div>					<p>Not too long ago we tapped into our inner voyeur and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102111/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/03/brooklyn_apartments.php#photo-1">looked inside Brooklyn apartments</a> circa 1978. Now we&apos;re taking a look back at the many faces of the New York City apartment throughout the years, from &quot;the oldest apartment house in New York City&quot; to the Bronx in the 1960s. Click through for a look at the exteriors of apartment buildings from all of the five boroughs.

Not too long after that, however, luxury apartments arrived&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102111/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/14_photos_of_manhattan_before_you_w.php#photo-4">The Dakota being one of the first</a>, built in 1884.</p>
