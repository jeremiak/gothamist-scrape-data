<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155302/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/27/video_babboons_in_prospect_park.php">Last month</a> Brooklyn got two new baby baboons, but they&apos;ve been nameless until now. We&apos;re told the duo was just dubbed Azizi and Jabari, names that pay homage to their ancestry. The Egyptian names mean &quot;brave&quot; and &quot;precious,&quot; and were chosen from at least a thousand suggestions that were submitted to the Prospect Park Zoo, where they live. You can visit them daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and the zoo&apos;s director even says they recognize their names now!</p>

<p>Also, be sure to check out all of the baboons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155302/http://www.prospectparkzoo.com/plan-your-trip/events-calendar/boo-at-the-zoo.aspx">smashing pumpkins</a> as Halloween comes up.</p>
