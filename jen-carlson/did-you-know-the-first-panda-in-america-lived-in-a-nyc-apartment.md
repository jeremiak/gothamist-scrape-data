<p>Fashion designer and New York socialite-turned-explorer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095753/http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0809/p16s01-bogn.html">Ruth Harkness</a>, traveled to China in 1936 in search of one of the rarest animals of the time: the panda. She succeeded in not just finding one, but she brought it back to America <em>in her arms</em> (getting it through as a dog). That kind of seems like a terrible idea! But Harkness was met back in the States with applause. </p>

<p>Sadly, after a year in captivity, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095753/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C17F73C5C1B7A93C0A9178FD85F4C8385F9">Su Lin died</a>... and is now stuffed and on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.</p>
