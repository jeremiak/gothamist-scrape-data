Another area, which recently got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117114022/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/realestate/25livi.html">the Times treatment</a>, is Kensington--where one couple in their 30s purchased a 3-bdrm postwar co-op for $313,000 in 2004. Today it would likely go for around $500K. With the economy as it is now, however, one broker noted that it&apos;s unlikely you&apos;ll see a boom with property values rising in places like Flatbush and East New York any time soon.
