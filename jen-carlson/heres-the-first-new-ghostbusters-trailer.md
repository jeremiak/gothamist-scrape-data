										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="GB3trailer.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050225im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/GB3trailer.jpg" width="640" height="290" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>When rumors of a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050225/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters"><em>Ghostbusters</em></a> circulated, then stagnated, then circulated again, then got more absurd, and dragged on for years... things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050225/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/bill_murray_has_in_his_possession_o.php">seemed hopeless</a>. The rumors themselves became an amusing sideshow, but beyond that a <em>Ghostbusters 3</em> seemed more unlikely than a <em>Big Lebowski 2: The L&apos;il Lebowski</em>.</p>

<p>But then Paul Feig signed on and put together a dream team of new &apos;Busters&#x2014;Melissa McCarthy (Abby, a paranormal expert), Kristen Wiig (Erin, a particle physicist), Kate McKinnon (Jillian, a nuclear engineer), and Leslie Jones (Patty, NYC expert!). And while the old guys will always have a special place in our hearts, these women kick their collective ass. Check out the first look below, where you won&apos;t see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050225/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/09/bill_murray_relents.php">Bill Murray&apos;s cameo</a>, but you will get a fresh take on the theme song and see other familiar faces, like the library ghost.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050225/http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-ghostbusters-trailer-is-here-and-everything-lo-1762501978">Feig spoke about the trailer</a>, which is nostalgic AF: &quot;I&#x2019;d be bummed if I didn&#x2019;t see the Ecto-1 and all that stuff. So we wanted to make sure we give those nods&#x2014;but make them our own, and give them their own original origin story. When you see the movie, there will be a lot of things you&#x2019;re happy to see, but they&#x2019;re coming at you at a slightly different way. This comes from such a pure place.&quot;</p>

<p>Ghostbusters will slime theaters on July 15th.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Watch the trailer again&#x2014;apparently there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050225/http://www.comicbookmovie.com/sci-fi/ghostbusters-viral-site-unveils-behind-the-scenes-featurette-with-even-a131652">secrets hidden</a> in the frames that lead to a site containing photos, a featurette, and some behind-the-scenes footage. Or just visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050225/http://www.paranormalstudieslab.com/#/">paranormalstudieslab.com</a> for all the fun.</p>
