<p>Brooklyn Bridge Park will be getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071242/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/36419">a public pool this summer</a>, which was made official when a $199,000 plan was signed off on this Wednesday. This won&apos;t be the floating pool that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071242/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/04/brooklyn_bridge_park_wants_a_floati.php">been discussed</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071242/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/03/floating_pool_f.php">recent years</a>, however, the 1,500-square-foot (that&apos;s 30&apos; x 50&apos;) above ground pool will be placed in the Pier 2 uplands section. This pool won&apos;t be <em>that</em> much fun for adults, however, as it will only be 3.5&apos; deep. </p>

<p>A park spokeswoman declared, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be awesome. It will be a real destination.&quot; Once it opens this summer, the pool will remain for around five years.</p>

<p>Speaking of Brooklyn public pool, it may be time to check back in on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071242/http://gothamist.com/tags/mccarrenparkpool">McCarren Park Pool</a>&apos;s renovation process&#x2014;once that one&apos;s complete, there will be shallow sections and deeper sections for adults.</p>
