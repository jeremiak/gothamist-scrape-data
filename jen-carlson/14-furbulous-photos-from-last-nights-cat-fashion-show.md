</div></div>					<p>Veronica Corningstone here, with a breaking report from the Cat Fashion Show that went down at the Algonquin Hotel last night. The city&apos;s most fashionable felines gathered at the intimate event, which at heart was a Debutante Ball celebrating the hotel&apos;s brand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207233439/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/the_algonquin_gets_a_new_matilda.php">new Matilda</a>. The <em>purrfect</em> centerpiece for the night was a cat fashion show, which the hotel holds every August&#x2014;click through for a <em>furbulous</em> first look at the show. This catabulous event was a benefit for the North Shore Animal League, where the hotel adopted their new Matilda earlier this year... but can you believe some of the cats dared show up in the same outfits as last year? Embarrassing! </p>

<p>If you&apos;re left wanting more, we&apos;ll have some outtakes later, and you can revisit last year&apos;s show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207233439/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/12/cat_fashion_show.php">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207233439/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/13/more_cat_fashion_show.php">here</a>.</p>
