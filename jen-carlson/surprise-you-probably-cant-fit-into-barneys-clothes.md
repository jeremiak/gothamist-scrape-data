<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081504/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/largest_size_retailer_barneys_our_Tuad4CzYStC2CiCB4fb7vM">One reporter</a> recently tried on a $315 dress, only to discover Barneys offers clothes in three sizes: 1, 2, and 3 (representing small, medium, and large). She says, &quot;I grabbed dresses in size two and three and headed to the fitting room. I&#x2019;m a small or medium everywhere I&#x2019;ve shopped, but I took the large because the dress looked like it ran small... but I couldn&#x2019;t even get it over my hips!&quot;</p>

<p>What&apos;s a girl to do? Call Barneys creative director Simon Doonan, of course&#x2014;who recently said the store was a perfect fit for Brooklyn. When the reporter questioned if she was too fat for Barneys, Doonan told her, &#x201C;There are certain designers who are all about the body. Others make an easy fit. You might need to look at other designers that focus less on the body.&#x201D;</p>
