<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="nkotb0311b.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412190321im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/nkotb0311b.jpg" width="365" height="298" class="image-right"> </span>We have a <em>friend</em> who was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412190321/http://gothamist.com/tags/nkotb">New Kids on the Block</a> fan a long time ago. In middle school. So long ago! At this point it&apos;s like that time never really existed for this <em>friend</em>. Anyway, this <em>friend</em> has much better taste in music now, but still, is wondering if it would kill these guys to play a show in New York City during their <a href="&#xE7;">collaborative tour</a> with The Backstreet Boys? It wouldn&apos;t kill them. We feel pretty secure in saying that it would 99% certainly not kill them. And yet, the closest venue to New York City is in <em>New Jersey</em>. </p>

<p>This <em>friend</em>, never having been a fan of The Backstreet Boys, is also wondering why they are in a collaborative band with The Backstreet Boys&#x2014;which is a good question, because they really didn&apos;t need nine people to make this song (just released, off their new collaborative album coming out in May):</p>

<p>They did this one with just five people!:</p>
