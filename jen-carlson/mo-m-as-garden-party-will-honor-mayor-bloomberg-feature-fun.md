<p>Every year MoMA hosts their annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://MoMA.org/partyinthegarden2013">Party In The Garden</a> and it&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/best_fancy_annual_events_in_nyc.php">really splendid</a> and much more interesting than staring at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://gothamist.com/tags/tildaswinton">some lady</a> sleeping in a glass box. No offense to Tilda, but <strike>this is a party in a garden inside one of the most iconic museums in New York City</strike> open bar!</p>

<p>This year MoMA has announced that the party will honor Mayor Bloomberg, the City of New York, and artists Ellsworth Kelly and Cindy Sherman, as well as feature a set by the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/andrew_dost_grammys.php">Fun.</a> (Previous years included sets from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/inside_momas_annual_garden_party_fe.php#photo-1">Santigold</a>, Solange Knowles (DJ set), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/kanye_west_garden_party.php#photo-1">Kanye West</a>.) And, again, also featured is the all you can drink top shelf hooch for three whole hours.</p>

<p>The party&#x2014;held inside the gorgeous Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden&#x2014;costs $200 and lasts from 9 p.m. to just around midnight (with an open bar that entire time, did we mention?). But don&apos;t get your hopes up on protecting your stomach with a layer of sobering and absorbant food&#x2014;the dinner, which Bloomberg will likely attend, costs $2,500 for a single ticket (and up to $100,000 for a table). Then again, maybe $2,500 is doable for you? If so, congratulations to you on managing to earn and save money so you can spend it on stuff&#x2014;let&apos;s talk about how you did this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://MoMA.org/partyinthegarden2013">on May 21st</a>, near Joan Mir&#xF3;&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061847/http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1195">Moonbird</a>... say, around 9:30 p.m.?</p>
