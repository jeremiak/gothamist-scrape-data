<p>For their latest prank, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151117090436/http://gothamist.com/tags/improveverywhere">Improv Everywhere</a> sent pedestrians into the middle a busy intersection outside of Penn Station... in the name of dance. </p>

<p>&quot;This project took place on the crosswalk in front of Penn Station on 7th Avenue, one of the busiest spots in the city,&quot; they note in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151117090436/http://improveverywhere.com/2015/09/08/ballroom-crosswalk/">their recap</a>. &quot;We staged the mission several times, with the performance repeating at each change of the light and always finishing before the &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Walk&#x201D; countdown clock reached zero.&quot; </p>

<p>Presumably no one got hurt during this bold ballroom dance session&#x2014;check it out below.</p>

<p>But the real challenge would have been to move this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151117090436/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/03/escape_from_penn_station_scenes_fro.php">INSIDE of Penn Station</a>, on say, a Friday at 5 p.m.</p>
