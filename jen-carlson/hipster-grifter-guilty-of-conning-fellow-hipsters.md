										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0409ferrellkari.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152800im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0409ferrellkari.jpg" width="350" height="334" class="image-left"> </span>It would be impossible to sum up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152800/http://www.observer.com/2009/style/hipster-grifter?page=0">the Observer&apos;s story</a> on 22-year-old grifter Kari Ferrell, who recently conned her way into many New Yorker&apos;s hearts, beds and wallets. She even landed a job at Vice magazine&#x2014;who are currently looking for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152800/http://vice.typepad.com/vice_magazine/2009/04/dept-of-oopsies-we-hired-a-grifter.html">a new administrative assistant</a>, by the way. The young Miss Ferrell somehow managed to convince everyone, at least for a short period of time, that (amongst other things) she had lung cancer, was pregnant, worked for Coachella promoters GoldenVoice, and that she would, like, totally pay them back. Eventually they were all smart enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152800/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22kari+ferrell%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=">to Google her</a> (hey amateurs, rule #1 in grifting: always change your name).</p>

<p>Amongst her notable traits, she has a tattoo on her back that reads &quot;I Love Beards&quot; and enjoys passing notes to strangers at the bar reading, &#x201C;I want to give you a hand job with my mouth,&quot; signing them &quot;Korean Abdul-Jabbar.&#x201D; Amazing, right? Even more amazing is that our very own Billy Parker was living right below her when she was sleeping with this Joe fellow in Greenpoint. She even offered to give &quot;a good friend&quot; of his a blowjob in the Turkey&apos;s Nest bathroom, passed a similar napkin note to a friend at Enid&apos;s <em>and</em> managed to convince him that she likes the NBA!</p>

<p>The article concludes that &quot;the Salt Lake City Police Department remains very, very interested in finding Ms. Ferrell&quot; (here&apos;s their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152800/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COVPtuMHKBE">video on her</a>). We have it on very good authority that she is still in town, and was at the Alligator Lounge on Metropolitan this past Friday night. Cannot wait until this <em>Law &amp; Order</em> episode comes out.</p>
