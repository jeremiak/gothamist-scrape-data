<p>Nitehawk Cinema will get in on the outdoor movie game just as the city&apos;s other summer screenings are winding down. This week they announced they&apos;ll be hosting their free series under the stars on the grounds of the former Domino Sugar Factory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152216/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/williamsburg_vacant_lot_transformed.php">at Havemeyer Park</a> starting in two weeks, and they&apos;re bringing their themed menus with them.</p>

<p>The movies they&apos;ve selected will be music-centric, starting with &quot;the sweet singing prostitutes in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152216/https://nitehawkoutdoors-whorehouse.eventbrite.com/"><em>Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</em></a>&quot; on August 20th (with Brooklyn band Doll Parts performing). On September 10th they&apos;ll host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152216/https://nitehawkoutdoors-chicago.eventbrite.com/">a <em>Chicago</em> white party</a> featuring a performance by Michael Arenella and His Dreamland Orchestra. And finishing things off on September 17th will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152216/https://nitehawkoutdoors-goldfinger.eventbrite.com/"><em>Goldfinger</em></a>, with New York City septet Morricone Youth.    <br>

<p>Food and drink vendors include Nitehawk Cinema (who promise special popcorns), Brooklyn Star (who will bring chicken and waffle cones, tofu and waffle cones and rotating chicken dishes inspired by each film), OddFellows (with ice cream flavors inspired by the flicks) and Brooklyn Brewery (beer, duh). Wine will also be available to purchase.</p>

<p>Performances will start around 7:30, and movies will follow about an hour later.</p>
