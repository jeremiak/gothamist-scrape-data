										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:225px; "> <img alt="ciroctoilet.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235748im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ciroctoilet.jpg" width="225" height="190"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235748/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/manhattan/diddy-vodka-war-20100325-lgf">MyFox5</a></span></i></div> The owner of Georgi Vodka, multi-millionaire Martin Silver, was not very happy when Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs took the mic at a nightclub in NYC last week and declared, &quot;If you&apos;re not drinking Ciroc vodka, then you&apos;re drinking pee pee.&quot; <p></p>

<p>He didn&apos;t specify Georgi, and he used such an elementary insult that it&apos;s barely worth reacting to&#x2014;but what else are you gonna do when you&apos;ve got nothing but time and a belly full of sub-par vodka?!</p>

<p>Silver got his revenge by sending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235748/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/manhattan/diddy-vodka-war-20100325-lgf">a toilet filled with Ciroc</a> to Diddy HQ in Times Square. Diddy&apos;s people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235748/http://www.tmz.com/2010/03/24/diddy-pisses-off-vodka-mogul/">told TMZ</a> it&apos;s just a &quot;publicity stunt [and] shouldn&apos;t be dignified with a statement.&quot;</p>

<p>Will the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235748/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/03/24/jay-z-takes-cameras-behind-his-911-benefit-in-ny-z/">Absolut Jay-Z team</a> get in on the action next?</p>
