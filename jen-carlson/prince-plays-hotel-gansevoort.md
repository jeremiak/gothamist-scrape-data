It went down for four hours (two shows) on the rooftop loft at the Hotel Gansevoort on Friday night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425234358/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/arts/music/13prin.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports that audience members paid around $1,000 to get inside the intimate room, with proceeds going to charity (Love 4 One Another Charities and Urban Farming). The Purple One did give a nod to the tough times however, the paper notes that &quot;moments into the early set he joked about the tough day, then he tweaked the lyrics of &apos;1999&apos; to reference the financial crisis.&quot; Howard Stern, Spike Lee and Dave Chappelle were all in attendance, and the latter even took over entertaining duties for a bit, saying, &#x201C;I played tambourine tonight at a Prince show &#x2014; that&#x2019;s the good news. The bad news is, I flew coach.&#x201D;</p>
