<p>Today a reader sent in this photo of an orphaned doberman, which she found tied to a fence in McCarren Park... abandoned during Rainpocalpyse &apos;11. She tells us: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;This morning, I found a Doberman Adult dog (male/unneutered) abandoned at the dog park in McCarren Park, Williamsburg.  He was left there for about 2 and half hours that I know of in rain with a tiny bag of food and his collar removed.  A local dog store in the area has taken him from the park to get him out of the rain, but I&#x2019;m not sure how long they will be able to keep him.  Unfortunately, my apartment isn&apos;t big enough for another dog or I would keep him because he is such a sweet dog. The owner of the store said she was going to ask around to the local shelters, but wasn&apos;t too optimistic.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>He&apos;s currently at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144416/http://www.ps9pets.com/index.php">PS9 Pet Supplies</a>, located at 169 North 6th Street in Williamsburg. If you can adopt or foster him, we suggest you call them, or head over there today! If you can&apos;t take in a dog, you can always donate money towards saving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144416/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/22/puppy_fans_save_this_puppy.php">this little pup</a>.</p>
