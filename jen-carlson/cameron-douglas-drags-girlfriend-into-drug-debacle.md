The 30-year-old son of Michael Douglas, and his first wife Diandra Luker, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231220319/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/06/cameron_douglas.php">recently busted</a> for dealing crystal meth, and now his girlfriend is joining the club. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231220319/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08112009/news/regionalnews/michael_douglas_sons_girlfriend_smuggled_184065.htm">The NY Post</a> reports that Kelly Sott &quot;was arrested after she tried to smuggle to him 10 bags of heroin&#x2014;hidden in an electric toothbrush&#x2014;right in front of prosecutors who are investigating him for drug trafficking.&quot; Douglas was in a meeting with the officials in Manhattan yesterday when he asked if he could call his girl to run an errand. Soon enough she was there with the toothbrush, which <em>of course</em> the officials were suspicious of and checked, and now she&apos;s being held without bail. Her lawyer said she&apos;s in need of treatment for a medical condition: &quot;heroin addiction and hypertension.&quot;</p>
