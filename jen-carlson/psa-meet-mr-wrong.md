<p>Spotted on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg, a public service announcement to women in the neighborhood looking for love. Apparently this guy moved himself <em>and</em> his daughter into this scorned woman&apos;s apartment when they were dating&#x2014;she fed him, gave him money, and he paid her back by having &quot;nasty sex&quot; without a condom in her bed when she was at work (unsubstantiated!). Anyway, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916222948/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/williamsburg/?p=38293">Miss Heather</a> says: &quot;Damn.&quot;</p>
