title: In Case You Were Wondering What Joe Perry's Son Is Up To

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="phpSm4dg6PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122623im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpSm4dg6PM.jpg" width="250" height="224"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">Adrian Perry</span></i></div> He&apos;s in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122623/http://tabtheband.com/">band right here in NYC</a>. Actually, the Aerosmith guitarist has two sons, both in the same band... but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811122623/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/it_trial_and_aero_69G6t2BGqRiESRllv1h1GP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">this Post article</a> is about his <em>favorite</em> son, the one that&apos;s also a lawyer. Shockingly, the famous familial fact isn&apos;t mentioned in the band&apos;s press releases (we went back to check ones we&apos;ve received). <p></p>

<p>If they were keeping mum, however, it seems 29-year-old Adrian Perry is ready to talk&#x2014;and in the piece, he also mentions the Manhattan law firm where he&apos;s a second year associate: Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP. He told the paper, &quot;I&apos;d seen the various mishaps with my dad&apos;s music career... he&apos;d gotten screwed over a bunch of times, and I just felt I wanted to protect myself. He definitely was a supporter of me going to law school... more supportive of that than pushing me to being a musician.&quot; </p>

<p>A lawyer/musician/famous rock star&apos;s son? This Post plug should help out ticket sales for their July 23rd show at Gramercy Theater, or at least his love life.</p>
