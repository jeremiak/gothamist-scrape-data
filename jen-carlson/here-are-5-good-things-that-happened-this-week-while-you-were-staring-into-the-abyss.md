<p>This week was &quot;good&quot; because I decided not to look at you-know-who&apos;s Twitter feed. Don&apos;t tell me what he did! LalalalalaLALALAAAA here are five good things that happened this week when absolutely nothing awful was being done to, say, healthcare, by, say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326184105/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/23/pat-roberts-gop-senator-deeply-regrets-mammogram-j/">old white men who don&apos;t think lady folk need mammograms</a>.</p>

<ul><li>10-year-old Haden is selling his drawings over on his lawn in North Carolina. The money he raises goes towards buying toys for his younger brother Max, who suffers from a rare nerve and tumor disorder. &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326184105/http://people.com/human-interest/10-year-old-sells-his-drawings-buy-toys-sick-brother/">If he&apos;s happy, I&apos;m happy</a>,&quot; he said. If only more adults were like Haden.
</li><li>Pope Francis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326184105/http://vinepair.com/booze-news/pope-francis-declares-wine-is-a-necessity/"><em>allegedly</em> declared</a>: &quot;Water is needed to live, but wine expresses the abundance of the banquet and joy of the celebration. Wine is necessary for celebration.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326184105/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4336234/Jared-Kushner-joins-Ivanka-Trump-Aspen-vacation.html">And every day, my friends, is a celebration</a>.
</li><li>A firefighter in California spent 20 minutes performing CPR on a dog who was rescued from a burning building AND IT WORKED. The dog is alive. &quot;He&apos;s a life and he&apos;s a life that matters,&quot; said firefighter Andrew Klein through his well-groomed handlebar mustache.
</li><li>Joe Biden met a dog named Joe Biden, and the 4-month-old golden retriever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326184105/https://www.instagram.com/p/BR8x4Feh3d-/?taken-by=bidenthegolden">licked the former VP right on the face</a>. If Joe Biden were a dog, I think we can all agree he would definitely be a golden retriever, the most loving and loyal of pups.
</li><li>And finally, Michelle Obama re-emerged on social media to share this photo of Bo and Sunny enjoying the first day of Spring. Remember Bo and Sunny? Remember the Obamas? Remember America? Good times.</li></ul>
