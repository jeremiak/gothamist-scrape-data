<p>Think about proposing marriage to the person you love in New York City. Where are you? Maybe a garden you walked through on your first date. Maybe a favorite restaurant. Maybe in bed. Maybe at the top of the Empire State Building. Maybe in a cemetery. Maybe in an alley. Maybe under a bridge. Maybe on a stoop. Maybe on the Staten Island Ferry. <em>There are plenty of places to propose here</em>, from personal to cliche. Almost everywhere is perfect, actually, within the five boroughs... except Times Square. Don&apos;t do that. </p>

<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154347/http://nypost.com/2016/01/15/heart-of-times-square-will-be-the-perfect-place-to-propose/">the NY Post</a> says that, <em>and we quote</em>, &quot;Times Square will be the perfect place to propose.&quot; When? In an imaginary future like in <em>I Am Legend</em>? <em>What even are you talking about NY Post?</em><br>
 <br>
They are talking about the latest piece of public art, Collective-LOK&apos;s &quot;Heart of Hearts,&quot; which will be unveiled on February 9th, just in time to disappoint the person you love with a proposal in Times Square on Valentine&apos;s Day, you failure.</p>

<p>The piece itself is pretty cool though, for non-proposal visits. It&apos;s described as a &quot;faceted ring of golden, mirrored hearts to create a kaleidoscopic pavilion that multiplies the spectacle of Times Square.&quot; Infinity Times Squares! It&apos;s like a <em>Black Mirror</em> level nightmare. But beautiful, as some nightmares are.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154347/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-arts/projects/at-the-crossroads/heart-of-hearts/index.aspx">official rendering</a> includes a... llama? Alpaca? Anyway, it&apos;s unclear why.</p>

<span class="photo_caption">Why?</span></p>

<p>Here&apos;s even more about the piece:</p><blockquote>CLOK&#x2019;s Heart of Hearts, a faceted ring of nine golden, mirrored hearts, will create an alternative pavilion that reflects and multiplies the pulsating activity of Times Square, creating a kaleidoscopic interior that dissolves the boundaries between viewing and performing. Within the ring, diamond-shaped spaces inside each heart will create &#x201C;kissing booths&#x201D; where couples will find their activities mirrored, allowing both privacy and publicity in the Heart of Hearts. This room within the room of Times Square is the most site-specific Heart installation to date and will be the first time a Valentine Heart will reach above 10 feet.</blockquote>It will be located in Duffy Square.<p></p>
