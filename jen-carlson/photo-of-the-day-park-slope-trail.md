<p>This photo, taken on 5th &amp; Union, pretty much sums up the war going on in Brooklyn. The fictional (but not really) &quot;Slope Trail&quot; includes a doggie bakery, luxury condos, a gentrified playground and spot to procure pricey Brooklyn T&apos;s. Everything you&apos;d expect on an urban hike. The stencil even includes a &quot;controversial&quot; stroller being pushed by a parent (or nanny!) who is clearly holding a Starbucks coffee. We just hope they&apos;re not pushing that stroller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519224356/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/27/union_hall_no_l.php">towards Union Hall</a>!</p>
