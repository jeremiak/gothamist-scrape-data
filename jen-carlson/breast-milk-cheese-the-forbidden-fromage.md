										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpnuYSW7PM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623102304im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpnuYSW7PM.jpg" width="323" height="350" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623102304/http://gothamist.com/tags/mothersmilk">Mother&apos;s Milk</a> cheese story has aged another day! Lori Mason, chef Daniel Angerer&apos;s wife and the woman whose milk has created the controversial cheese, takes center stage with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623102304/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/human_cheese_ma_don_have_cow_mspd5ZGAOOcFwi48jnErwN">NY Post</a> cover today. She tells the paper her product is 100% organic and free range, as opposed to what one may pick up at their local grocer; she declares she&apos;s &quot;healthier than your average cow and I&apos;m not pumped full of steroids!&quot; However, the Department of Health is still strongly advising against the couple serving up her cheese to strangers.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623102304/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/09/breast_milk_cheese.php">more than half of you</a> said you would never try the stuff, there have been some curious customers showing up at Klee Brasserie. Angerer maintains he&apos;s not selling there, however brave insiders have taken a taste. Amongst them is Murray&apos;s Cheese VP Liz Thorpe, who tells the paper, &quot;It was slippery, slightly crunchy and tasted like pickles.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623102304/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-03-09/breast-milk-cheese/">Gael Greene</a> also tried the forbidden fromage, saying &quot;it is quite bland, slightly sweet, [but] it&apos;s the unexpected texture that&#x2019;s so off-putting. Strangely soft, bouncy, like panna cotta.&quot;</p>

<p>If the bad reviews still leave you craving the Mother&apos;s Milk cheese, Angerer says he may be hosting private tasting parties and picnics (by the way, he suggests a nice bottle of Riesling to compliment it)&#x2014;however, the DoH says, &quot;He can&apos;t do that either.&quot;</p>
