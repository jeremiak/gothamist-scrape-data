Her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209095453/http://foundmoolah.blogspot.com/">Found Money</a> blog isn&apos;t the only one in town, however. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209095453/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/01/12/2009-01-12_staten_island_woman_finds_streets_paved_.html">The Daily News</a> reports that there are dozens of change bloggers nationwide, all trying to fill up their piggy banks for rainy days. In New York, there&apos;s also Barbara Humphrey, a Staten Island mom whose gotten the whole family involved and records her findings at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209095453/http://www.changepot.blogspot.com/">Change Pot</a>. So far this year she&apos;s already up to $47.05, and has saved over $1,000 since starting three years ago. The paper notes that &quot;Oddly, in wealthy Manhattan neighborhoods, they rarely find anything,&quot; which may explain why McCutchin is only up to $16.63 since last June. That could be up one cent by the end of the day, however&#x2014;she wrote on her blog earlier: &quot;Today I found a penny but it was frozen solid into some dirt near the base of a tree.  I can&apos;t decide if I should go back with a cup of hot water or a screw-driver.&quot;</p>
