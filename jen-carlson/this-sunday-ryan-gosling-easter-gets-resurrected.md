<p>Last year just after Spring sprung, the winter clouds parted and the warm sunshine unfurled like golden ribbons to reveal colorful little eggs hidden around the town. Inside each egg there was a message that, if you could suspend disbelief, came from Ryan Gosling himself. If you couldn&apos;t suspend disbelief, then at least you walked away with a plastic egg and a photo of The Most Handsome, But Also You Know He&apos;ll Just Make You Laugh And Laugh And Laugh And It&apos;s Not Really About Looks, Man Of Our Time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052156/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/08/ryan_gosling-themed_easter_egg_hunt.php">Gosling Easter</a> was magic, either way, and this year it returns.</p>

<p>The organizer told us this week that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052156/https://twitter.com/GoslingEaster">Gosling Easter</a> &quot;will be out in full force again this year&#x2014;only bigger and better and Goslinger. I can&apos;t reveal all the details just yet, because that wouldn&apos;t be fun [but] there will be tons more eggs and they&apos;ll be hidden in New York, as well as other cities and countries, with a few other surprises.&quot; The hunt begins this Easter Sunday morning, ladies.</p>
