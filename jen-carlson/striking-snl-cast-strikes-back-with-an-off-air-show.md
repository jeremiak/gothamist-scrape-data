Live and un-aired, the show was to help raise money for crew members affected by the strike. Amy Poehler, who organized the event, made this statement:</p><blockquote>&quot;The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater is a second home to a lot of these performers and writers. We are doing this to raise spirits, raise awareness, and raise money for our hard working production crews who will be having a hard holiday season if this strike continues.&quot;</blockquote>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175358/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11182007/news/nationalnews/striking_comedy_by_snl_4242.htm">NY Post</a>, guests included Darrell Hammond, &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; star Samm Levine and host Michael Cera. In addition, everyone from the cast was on hand -- except Maya Rudolph. Lorne Michaels, who celebrated his 63rd birthday that night, was even in attendance. As for the audience, a majority of it was comprised of friends of cast members and regular performers at UCB, so the show was just as hard to get into as the regular SNL taping at Studio 8H. Tonight another hard to get into show will be hosted at UCB when <em>30 Rock</em> takes the stage (this won&apos;t be Alec Baldwin&apos;s first time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175358/http://www.flickr.com/photos/lightbursts/406449277">performing at the venue</a> either), though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508175358/http://www.ucbtheatre.com/schedule/showdetails.php?showid=1584">the site</a> still says a limited amount of tickets will be available at the door. <p></p>
