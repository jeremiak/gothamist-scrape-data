</div></div>					<p>No matter what you see happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020540/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/28/new_yorkers_react_to_super_bowl_blv.php">on Broadway right now</a>, the Super Bowl is actually taking place in New Jersey. However, the more important Bowl&#x2014;The Puppy Bowl&#x2014;is taking place in New York. Actually, the one that will air probably took place last year in a studio somewhere&#x2014;but there are puppies... on a field... in Times Square... <em>right now</em>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020540/http://www.discoverytsx.com/puppy-bowl">Puppy Bowl Experience Exhibit</a> is located at Discovery Times Square (226 W 44 Street, between 7th and 8th). It&apos;s free, and you can drop by today through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Visitors will get a chance to learn about the history of Puppy Bowl while walking through the Hall of Fame, as well as enjoy live action on the replica field (all the pups you see are rescues from the ASPCA, and there will be some on-site adoption events). There are also interactive booths including a tail-gate area with games and face painting, a &quot;kissing booth,&quot; and you&apos;ll get a chance to step into the press box to call a game.</p>

<p>Last night we got a look at the place during a party celebrating the 10th Annual Puppy Bowl&#x2014;click through for photos of cat crasher Lil Bub, and Jon Stewart and his 3-legged brindle pit pull!</p>
