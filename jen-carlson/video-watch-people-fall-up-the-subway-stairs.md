<p>As long as no one gets seriously hurt, it&apos;s safe to say that falling is one of the most humorous things that can happen (remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430041145/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/20/video_hipsters_falling_on_ice.php">Hipsters On Ice</a>?). It&apos;s like a gag that our feet play on us, and one that usually incites a laugh, because <em>we&apos;ve all been there</em>&#x2014;toppling over in front of strangers, tripping on the sidewalk, and losing our footing on the subway stairs. That all makes this video an instant classic&#x2014;watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430041145/http://vimeo.com/44807536">one man&apos;s documentation</a> people tripping up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430041145/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_Street_(BMT_Fourth_Avenue_Line)">a subway step</a> that&apos;s a fraction of an inch higher than all the other steps.</p>
