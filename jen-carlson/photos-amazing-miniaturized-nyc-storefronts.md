</div></div>					<p>Artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011150/http://www.newyorkstorefronts.com/#a/9631">Randy Hage</a> has created miniature versions of beloved New York City storefronts before, and now he&apos;s got three new detailed offerings ahead of his gallery show (which will be in... Los Angeles) next month. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011150/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2013/09/new-work-from-randy-hage.html">Vanishing NY</a>, Hage has now shrunk down Yonah Shimmel Knish Bakery on the LES,  Ray&apos;s Grocery on Flatbush (complete with the Space Patrol kiddie ride),  and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011150/http://www.yelp.com/biz/zig-zag-records-brooklyn">the shuttered</a> Zig Zag Records in Sheepshead Bay to 1/12th of their actual sizes.</p>

<p>His solo show in LA is a charity event worth mentioning: 100% of the sales will be donated to the Rachel Ann Hage Neuro-Oncology Research Fund, in honor of Randy&apos;s daughter who passed away in 2000 from a brain tumor when she was just four years old. Hage told Vanishing NY, &quot;My wife told me that she thought my attachment to the loss of the New York storefronts was somehow birthed from emotions surrounding the loss of our daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>Since we&apos;ll all be in New York, you can always send in a donation to: The Rachel Ann Hage Neuro-Oncology Fund c/o Children&apos;s Hospital Los Angeles, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Los Angles, CA 90027. And you can see much more of his amazing work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011150/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mindseyeminiatures/with/8391748293/">right here</a>.</p>
