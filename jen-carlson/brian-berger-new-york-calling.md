Musicians, artists, and writers could subsist even in Manhattan, while immigrants from the world over were reinventing the city in their own image.&quot; Brian Berger, historian Marshall Berman and a troupe of contributers revisit the Big Apple of yesteryear in their book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170625/http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Calling-Blackout-Bloomberg/dp/1861893388/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1196915351&amp;sr=8-1"><em>New York Calling</em></a>. All five boroughs are documented through words and images, becoming a nostalgic collection as well as a reflection on how the city has changed.</em> </p>

<p><strong>How did you and Marshall Berman decide to compile New York Calling?</strong>  <br>
In December 2002 my friend Robert Sietsema and I were in a Russian pelmenyi joint in Bensonhurst with Reaktion Books publisher, Michael Leaman. Reaktion was soon going to publish a collection of essays on London since the 1970s and we all thought a similar New York book could be very interesting.  </p>

<p>Long story short, I got the gig, with the proviso I bring Marshall on board as the &quot;name&quot; co-editor. That was fine with me, with the one small problem being... I had never met him before! Marshall was working on the manuscript for his Times Square book, On The Town: 100 Years of Spectacle then but we hit it off well enough he agreed to do it. (We&apos;ve since become very close.) I got to work on an outline, which in our case was a surrogate book proposal and, after some contractual wrangling with Reaktion, I started querying writers in December 2004.  </p>
