</div></div>					<p>A tipster sent along these photos taken around 1 p.m. at Court Street and Warren, wondering if it&apos;s the latest from Banksy (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023241/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/photo_new_banksy_in_east_new_york.php">earlier today</a> put up a new piece in East New York). We&apos;re told that the animals are animated and making sounds of squeaking toys&#x2014;&quot;That&apos;s what got me out to the sidewalk. It was so loud. Not sure but i think someone was in the truck banging as if the animals were trying to escape.&quot; </p>

<p>The truck&apos;s door does have the Banksy 1-800 number on it, but so far there&apos;s nothing about it when you call the line.</p>

<p>When asked about the truck, the driver said he &quot;didn&apos;t know anything, I&apos;m just the delivery guy.&quot; We&apos;ll update when we have more information, but the truck is now on the move, so be on the lookout!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> On October 11th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023241/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/stuffed_animal_truck_is_the_work_of.php">Banksy confirmed this was his work</a>, titled The Sirens Of The Lambs.</p>
