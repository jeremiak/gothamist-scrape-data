										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="php3peoPBAM.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033932im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/php3peoPBAM.jpg" width="300" height="225"> <br> <i><span class="photo_caption">The lobby, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033932/http://regoforestpreservation.blogspot.com/">Rego-Forest Preservation Council</a></span></i></div> What does one do with an old, now landmarked, theater in Queens? That&apos;s the big question for the owners of Ridgewood Theatre&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033932/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/ridgewood_theater.php">in January</a> the facade was landmarked, but the interior can still be renovated&#x2014;leaving a few options on their hands. <p></p>

<p>The owners are still seeking partners to help them get the space operational again; one of them, Tony Montalbano, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033932/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/09/2010-04-09_a_reel_conundrum_condos_or_restoration_at_old_movie_house.html">the Daily News</a>, &quot;We don&apos;t know which way we&apos;re going.&quot; He may be keeping mum, but one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520033932/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/25/ridgewood_theatre.php">original ideas</a> was to turn the 17,000-square-footer into a dual movie theater/retail space. A win-win situation, but it all comes down to who&apos;s writing the checks.</p>

<p>The Ridgewood Local Development Corporation&apos;s Paul Kerzner says it could also be turned into... condos. He noted, &quot;There&apos;s no preconceived notion of what this could or couldn&apos;t be. Obviously one of its best uses is to fully restore it&quot;&#x2014;the Beaux-Arts designed theater was first opened on December 23rd,1916, and is the longest-running movie house in the nation&#x2014;&quot;but in today&apos;s economic climate, our timing may be off.&quot;</p>
