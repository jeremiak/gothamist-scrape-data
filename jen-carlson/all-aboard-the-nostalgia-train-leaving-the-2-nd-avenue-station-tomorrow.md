<p>Move over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123161549/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/14/mta_rolls_out_retro_buses_again.php">vintage buses</a>, we&apos;re back on to our vintage train obsession for the weekend. Tomorrow is the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123161549/http://gothamist.com/tags/vintageteaparty">Vintage Tea &amp; Swing Dancing Party</a> aboard a vintage subway train, hosted once again by Levys&apos; Unique New York. The free (aside from your MetroCard swipe) event takes place tomorrow from noon to 4 p.m., and all interested parties should meet on the 2nd Avenue station&apos;s uptown F platform. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123161549/http://levysuniqueny.com/events/vintage-tea-and-vintage-swing-dancing-party-aboard-vintage-subway-train-occupy-all-vintage-trains/">More from the organizers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Lovers of swing dancing as well as dandies and debutantes with tea cozies and finger sandwiches will converge on the 2nd Avenue station to celebrate the Vintage Trains from the 1920s onwards! At 12 noon, the music starts! At 12:30 pm, NYC Swing Dancers will occupy the subway cars and dance to live music by live swing and dance music by some of NYC&apos;s hottest Vintage Jazz Bands! Once the trains take off (at 12:57pm,) the dancing continues until the end of the line; that&apos;s when the train u-turns and comes back to the East Village. Then at 2 pm, join (non-political, non-aggro) tea partiers from around the city to enjoy a Vintage Tea party on the Vintage NYC Subway Trains. 

<p>We will have thermoses of tea and cookies, but all chinaware, tea cozies, cucumber sandwiches, sugar cubes, cream, should come with you! Come dressed in your finest dandery, outrageous hats preferred and enjoy a communal tea party!</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Just don&apos;t spill anything on the vintage wicker seats. We&apos;ll have photos from the event, so if you&apos;re planning on attending, wear your finest threads and smile for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123161549/http://samhorine.com/">Sam Horine</a>.</p>
