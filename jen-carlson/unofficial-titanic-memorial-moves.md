<p>About <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152431/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/25/please_explain_rms_titanic_memorial_in_long_island_city.php">5 years ago</a> we pondered the mysterious Titanic house in Long Island City&#x2014;which turned out to be the work of Joe Colletti, a collector of memorabilia from the ship and overseer of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152431/http://www.notfortourists.com/LD.aspx/New-York/Landmarks/RMS-Titanic-Memorial">an unofficial memorial</a> to its tragic end. Well, he&apos;s now moved out and handed over his collection to the Greater Astoria Historical Society. </p>

<p>He&apos;s been helping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152431/http://www.astorialic.org/">the society</a> catalog the photographs, drawings, letters and other items he&apos;s collected throughout the years&#x2014;which took three van trips to transport. The VP there applauded him, saying, &#x201C;This is a phenomenal thing that he&#x2019;s done in terms of taking it upon himself, his time and his money to put something like this together.&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152431/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/titanic_relics_take_anchor_at_astoria_ljlTDWYyG51eVf2hI7srjI">Reportedly</a> Colletti&apos;s passion grew after meeting a survivor decades ago, and being told there were no major memorials to the disaster in New York City&#x2014;it was then that he began adorning his home with souvenirs from the ship.</p>

<p>Some locals were unnerved by the sudden disappearance of the tribute, but Colletti says the move was necessary because he disliked the way the neighborhood was changing.</p>
