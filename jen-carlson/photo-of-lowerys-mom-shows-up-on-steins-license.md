                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="lowery0510.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002030959im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/lowery0510.jpg" width="130" height="109" class="image-right"> </span>Investigators originally had their eye on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002030959/http://gothamist.com/tags/natavialowery">Natavia Lowery</a>&apos;s mother after the murder of Linda Stein. Allegedly Lottie Lowery-Walsh&apos;s photograph showed up on several doctored copies of Stein&apos;s driver&apos;s license, which were found in Stein&apos;s desk, used by Lowery when she was her assistant. One source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002030959/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/murder_license_to_chill_HgMHQuJgpQS7Oqs7jd8nbO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the NY Post</a>, &quot;It was Natavia&apos;s mother&#x2014;that&apos;s whose picture it was. It was her own mother. This, we thought, was huge. Who knows what Natavia&#x2014;with or without her mother&#x2014;was up to with that.&quot; Lowery was just sentenced to over 30 years in prison for bludgeoning Stein to death, as well as stealing $30,000+ from her. Her mother has not been charged with anything, even though at least $10,000 of that stolen cash ended up in one of her bank accounts and was used to pay Lowery&apos;s legal fees.</p>
