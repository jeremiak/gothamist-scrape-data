<p>The latest Reddit AMA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152517/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1c67y8/i_am_the_last_of_a_dying_breed_i_am_a_time_square/">is with a Times Square Live Nude Girl</a>, who says she&apos;s been &quot;working at the peeps for a minute while I figure out what I am doing now that I graduated college.&quot; She most likely works somewhere like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152517/http://narrative.ly/still-standing/the-last-peeps/">Gotham City</a>, one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152517/http://www.yelp.com/biz/gotham-city-new-york">last remaining peeps</a> located at the corner of 8th and 43rd. So what did we learn from the girl behind the <strike>glass</strike> plastic?</p>

<p><strong>What happens when you go into a peep show?</strong> &quot;Walk in, pick a booth and shut the door put a dollar in the slot and the window will go up. Meet the girls and pick one for your show. Put a 10 in the slot and the window will go up for five minutes. Tip the girl 10 for topless and 20 for full nude. 30 for finger masturbation shows and higher for toys and double show.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Can you see men masturbating?</strong> &quot;I can see their faces. I am on kind of a raised platform.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Who are these guys?</strong> &quot;Surprisingly, a good portion of the customers are normal people. It&apos;s cheaper than getting a lap dance and you get a custom show, tailored to your fantasy. Of course there are unsavory types, but it&apos;s a shady industry.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Is it safe?</strong> &quot;I feel safe because the block is always busy and it&apos;s right in Times Square. Granted, you need to keep your bearings about you but for the most part, I have not had any trouble.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>How much money is in this gig?</strong> &quot;I average anywhere from 200-400 for a six hour shift. It really is a mixed bag and depends on the weather and shift I am working. I have heard summertime gets slow. Some days I sit and make 20 dollars though. I am able to pay my rent and save a little bit after expenses.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What do you do in your down time?</strong> &quot;I would rather be able to read/knit/write on the off time of work rather than hang out in a smelly bar with loud headsplitting music. I HAAATE nightclubs and loud music and I don&apos;t drink. Strippers and sex workers are just normal girls too, who eat cereal, watch cartoons, buy milk, have hobbies... it&apos;s not like they go home to glitter covered sex ranch apartments.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s next for you?</strong> &quot;I have an internship that doesn&apos;t pay but can provide with references. I understand that my lifestyle has an expiration date. I am not too worried about becoming unattractive.&quot;</p>
