title: Awkward: Sarah Palin Offers Bristol to Babysit for Fey
---

	
										<p>Tina Fey has been making her 30 Rock promo rounds (the season premiere airs tomorrow) and appeared on Conan last night, where the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165951/http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien/video/clips/tina-fey-part-1-102808/793845/">first segment</a> was all about that <em>other</em> show: SNL. (She says her recent stints at her old gig have been akin to &quot;moving back in with your parents.&quot;) </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, it turns out some of the best parts of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165951/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/19/pregnant_poehler_poaches_palins_par.php">Sarah Palin&apos;s appearance</a> on the show happened off-camera; Fey talks about meeting her, and what had to have been the awkward offering-up of Bristol Palin to babysit her 3-year-old that night. Fey comments, <strong>&quot;That&apos;s exactly what 17-year-old Bristol Palin wants to do at SNL, is babysit the toddler of the lady that goofs on her mom.&quot;</strong> Check out the second segment after the jump, for 30 Rock chatter and what it&apos;s like to hug Oprah (spoiler: it&apos;s like &quot;going to a spa for a week&quot;).</p>
