<p>This all comes on the heels of &quot;The <em>Other</em> Artist is Present,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108174354/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/03/performance-artist-crashes-moma-exhibit/">a young man&apos;s piece</a> in which he attempted to challenge Abramovic&apos;s stillness with words and other antics (he got tossed out of the museum by security). Liftig noted, &quot;I felt the previous interventions were really aggressive and presumptuous. I wanted to operate within the piece as Marina had defined it to create something that was more ambiguous. I wanted to meet her on her terms and leave the interpretation of my action a little more open than the others.&quot; From what we can tell she mainly succeeded in pissing off other patrons, who had gotten up early to get a turn sitting across from the famous artist.
