<p>In June, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312201958/http://gothamist.com/tags/amandapalmer">Amanda Palmer</a> became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312201958/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/04/amanda_palmer_tells_us_about_becomi.php">a Kickstarter millionaire</a> after reaching and surpassing her $100,000 goal on the fundraising platform by over $900,000. The money is going towards her new record, an art book, and accompanying tour... which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312201958/http://www.amandapalmer.net/shows/">she is currently on</a>. Palmer and her band, The Grand Theft Orchestra, will be performing at Webster Hall on September 11th (the release date for the album, <em>Theatre is Evil</em>), and a few weeks ago they stopped by the South Street Seaport Museum to film a few songs for our Gothamist House series. Enjoy!</p>
