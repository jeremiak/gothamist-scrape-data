<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="smLGcbgbfest.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322054318im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/smLGcbgbfest.jpeg" width="325" height="238" class="image-right"> </span>In January we exclusively reported that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322054318/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/we_hear_cbgb_is_planning_to_reopen.php">CBGB would be returning</a> as a venue, but before that happens you can expect to hear more about the festival the owners are planning, which will likely take place in early July.</p>

<p>This morning we were told that festival details will be released in about four weeks. For now, we can tell you that Duff McKagan (Guns n&apos; Roses, Velvet Revolver) has expressed interest and could potentially be one of the headlining acts&#x2014;the venue and the musician have a mutual appreciation for each other. There will also be plenty of smaller NYC-based bands, and the organizers were down at SXSW last week checking some out. We hear they really dug the band FIDLAR... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120322054318/http://fidlar.bandcamp.com/">which sounds about right</a>.</p>

<p>If all goes as planned, the CBGB music festival (which may also include things like panels, screenings, etc) will be an annual event, occurring in all five boroughs, at hundreds of different venues. As for a new CBGB venue, that is still in the works, though no leases have been signed just yet.</p>
