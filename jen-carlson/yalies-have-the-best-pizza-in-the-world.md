										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="pizzanyc0909.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221073638im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/pizzanyc0909.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="image-left"> </span>A new list picking 50 foods and naming the best spots in the world for them finds that various locales around the five boroughs have the top burgers, ravioli, pork belly and pastrami sandwiches (at Katz&apos;s, natch). But if you&apos;re looking for the best slice, you&apos;re in the wrong town. </p>

<p>As we&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221073638/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/man_vows_to_eat_a_slice_at_every_ny.php">already mentioned</a>, Frank Pepe Pizzeria in New Haven has the world&apos;s best slice, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221073638/http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/13/best-foods-in-the-world">this latest list of top spots</a> is just one more to confirm it. But it&apos;s okay guys, we still have our bagels. </p>

<p>Perhaps a winner within the five boroughs should be declared, however, once and for all! If you ask Counting Crows&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221073638/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/03/adam_duritz_counting_crows.php">Adam Duritz</a> he&apos;ll tell you Joe&apos;s Pizza is the best (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221073638/http://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-pizza-manhattan">the Yelpers</a> give it 4 out of 5 stars); do you dare challenge the dreaded one?</p>
