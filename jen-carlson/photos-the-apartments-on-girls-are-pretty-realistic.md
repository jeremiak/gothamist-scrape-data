She told us of the latter, &quot;When we were building the apartment, for example, we were like, no, this is going to look like a small apartment. This is not going to be a dream apartment. This is going to be a walk up in a building in Greenpoint. We looked at models and we were really committed to making those places feel real.&quot; And the show really does have the most realistic Brooklyn and Manhattan apartments on television.</p>

<p>The neighborhoods chosen for the characters are also realistic&#x2014;Ray lives in (Adam&apos;s old apartment) on St. John&apos;s Place in Prospect Heights; Adam and Hannah live on India Street in Greenpoint; Jessa and Shoshanna live on Elizabeth near Broome in NoLita... and Marnie gets a new, not very nice, apartment this season.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104857/http://architizer.com/blog/girls-architecture/">Architizer</a> is taking a look at the apartments through the designs of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104857/http://www.lauraballingerdesign.com/">Laura Ballinger</a>, who drew the apartment layouts for the first season (all of those apartments, except for Charlie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104857/http://www.lauraballingerdesign.com/#s=0&amp;mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;p=1&amp;a=0&amp;at=0">amazing Bed-Stuy studio</a>, are still in the show). How they all actually make rent is still a mystery, but click through for a look at their lifelike abodes... and for some not-very-realistic portrayals of NYC on the screen, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104857/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycasseenontv">our archives</a>.
