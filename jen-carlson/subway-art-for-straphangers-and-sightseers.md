<p>It&apos;s not a secret that the subway system has some great art, an entire book was put out about it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008181627/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/10/subway_art_as_c.php">in 2006</a>. But since residents often stick to their regular lines, it&apos;s likely that not many have seen it all. Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008181627/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/16/tile-art-in-nyc-subw.html">Boing Boing</a> pointed to some subterranean tile art featuring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008181627/http://www.michaelspornanimation.com/splog/?p=1330">polar bears and penguins</a>, oh my! </p>

<p>For those who want to see all of the subway sights without putting down too much cash on a Metrocard (or for those who simply need a guiding light to point them in the right direction), there&apos;s a handy little online source aptly titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008181627/http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/artwork">Subway Art Guide</a> that can show you the way. They have 212 pieces documented, with artist/title/station listed, as well as a little history and photos of each piece. What do you see at your stop?</p>
