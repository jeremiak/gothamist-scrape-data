title: Dr. Zizmor Brings Subway Ads Back to Small Screen
---

	
										<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001840/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/08/dr_z.php">we chatted</a> with Dr. Zizmor, the &quot;subway dermatologist,&quot; about the television ads he ran prior to taking his campaign underground and off-screen. Now he&apos;s gone and combined the two! Warning, this jingle <em>will</em> get stuck in your head. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423001840/http://westsidespirit.com/?p=3343">West Side Spirit</a> calls the doc&apos;s past advertising approaches &quot;refreshingly artless, even na&#xEF;ve...[with] no coyness, no Don Draper-style sublimation, no hidden agenda.&quot; The new one, which began airing on October 5th, they say &quot;breaks the fourth wall and draws attention to the construct of the Zizmor ad itself. Poking a little fun at his self-created universe, he lifts images from his old subway banners and weaves them into a new ad made of ads.&quot; That jingle&apos;s still stuck in your head, <em>isn&apos;t it</em>.</p>
