He, along with his goat Cocoa, became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081219/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/uncovered_pizza_eating_goat_is_a_ne.php">press darlings</a> for a brief period, and now he&apos;s making headlines again. The New Jersey man, 51-year-old Cyrus Fakroddin, was arrested at his home in Summit and charged with 1st Degree Aggravated Sexual Assault against a woman who was physically helpless, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130611081219/http://www.nj.com/independentpress/index.ssf/2013/01/summit_man_charged_with_sexual.html#incart_river_default">to NJ.com</a>.<p></p>

<p>Fakroddin allegedly brought the incapacitated woman to his home in November; he &quot;was in Manhattan when he encountered a 19-year-old woman who was physically and mentally incapacitated. Earlier in the evening the victim had been at a Manhattan nightclub with friends.&quot; He allegedly put the woman in his van and brought her to his home in New Jersey, where he sexually assaulted her. &quot;When she regained consciousness several hours later, she reportedly had no memory of meeting Fakroddin or traveling to his house.&quot; The woman contacted a friend, got back to Manhattan, and sought medical attention; there is reportedly physical forensic evidence on hand relating to the case.</p>

<p>Fakroddin is now being held in the Union County Jail on $250,000 bail.</p>
