<p>Are You There, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130856/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/15/nyregion/from-a-captive-audience-clients-law-firm-goes-mass-market-with-1-800-subway-ads.html">1-800-DIVORCE</a>? It&apos;s Me, The Wife Of Some Idiot. </p>

<p>Ever wondered what the story is behind a book you picked up from the curb or someone&apos;s stoop? Well, if you picked up a copy of this Judy Blume classic recently, look no further than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130856/http://freewilliamsburg.com/have-you-seen-this-judy-blume-book-this-dude-is-in-some-serious-trouble/">these flyers</a>, which have gone up around Greenpoint after a husband banished his wife&apos;s most prized possession to the curb. The appeal reads:</p>

<blockquote>I accidentally gave this book away on Saturday July 25th in a box on the corner of Green &amp; Franklin. This book is extremely important to my wife. It was a keepsake from her mother and is irreplaceable. On the inside cover is a note that reads &#x201C;Christmas 1991.&#x201D; If you happened to pick up this book can you please get in touch with me.</blockquote>

<p>In an effort to help save this marriage, we are now sharing this information with you. Someone please return the book, or a reasonable facsimile, to this man. </p>
