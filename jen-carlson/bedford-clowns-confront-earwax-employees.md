<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415000725/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0805clowns.jpg"><img alt="0805clowns.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415000725im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0805clowns-thumb.jpg" width="320" height="212" class="right"></a>Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415000725/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/14/video_of_the_da_152.php">in January video emerged</a> of an enthusiastic street performer, Matthew Silver, dancing in front of Earwax record store on Bedford Avenue. It seems that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415000725/http://bcfools.com/2008/05/15/the-mighty-vengeance-of-the-earwax-watermen-recap">a war has been going on since</a>, between the employees of the store and the ever-growing troupe of Silver&apos;s clowns (dubbed the BC Fools) that adorn the outside of its shop.</p>

<p>Seems the Earwax employees have been dumping buckets of water on the performers (who have gone into the store on occasion); in the past they&apos;ve also been threatened with mace, and dumped water on their electrical equipment, cameras and even an innocent baby bystander! The drenched victims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415000725/http://www.gowanuslounge.com/2008/05/18/bedford-dancer-vs-earwax-records-war-brewing-in-burg">declared they&apos;d get their revenge</a>, which was to come yesterday. </p>

<p>The clowns were certainly present on Bedford, but it&apos;s been eerily quiet when it comes to news of their Earwax endeavor...</p>
