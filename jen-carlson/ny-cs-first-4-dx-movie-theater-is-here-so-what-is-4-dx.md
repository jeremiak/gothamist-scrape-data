<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="new4DX.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912121434im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/new4DX.jpg" width="355" height="232" class="image-right"> </span>New York City&apos;s first 4DX theater is opening this month, according to a press release that triumphantly appeared in our inbox today&#x2014;but what is 4DX, even?</p>

<p>Is it IMAX? No.</p>

<p>Is it 3-D? Not quite. </p>

<p>In short, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912121434/http://www.cj4dx.com/">4DX</a> is &quot;an immersive theater technology featuring moving seats and environmental effects.&quot; The experience will bring wind, fog, rain, lightning, vibration, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912121434/http://www.cj4dx.com/about/effects.asp">TICKLING</a>, snow and scents to your seats, giving viewers a visual, aural, olfactory and tactile film-viewing experience, &quot;perfectly syncing cutting-edge technology to the action onscreen.&quot; It&apos;s like an action park ride in the movie theater, but with &quot;ticklers.&quot; Just the kind of experience to make movie-going in New York City even more hellish.</p>

<p>While this works best with blockbusters, we hope that one day the technology advances to add value to every film. Who <em>doesn&apos;t</em> need a personal space machine to push others away during Todd Solondz&apos;s latest surreal cinematic foray?</p>

<p>But for now, it&apos;s the big, showy <em>something goes boom</em> blockbusters, and the first flick you&apos;ll be able to experience this in is <em>Batman V. Superman</em>, opening on March 25th at Regal Union Square Stadium 14. This will be followed by a 4DX theater opening at the Regal E-Walk 13 on April 28th. These are the 3rd and 4th auditoriums in the whole United States to host 4DX screens.</p>

<p>Now can we work on movie theater seats that repel bedbugs?</p>
