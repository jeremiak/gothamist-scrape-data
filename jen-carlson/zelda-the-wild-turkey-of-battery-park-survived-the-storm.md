<p>It&apos;s not surprising that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003455/http://gothamist.com/tags/zelda">Zelda</a>&#x2014;the wild turkey of Battery Park that escaped her journey onto the West Side Highway <em>unscathed</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003455/http://gothamist.com/2004/04/12/downtown_is_turkey_town.php">in 2004</a>, survived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003455/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">the Frankenstorm</a>. This afternoon Michael Cyr, who manages the food kiosks in Battery Park for the Cleaver Company and the Green Table in Chelsea Market, sent over the above photo of Zelda in the park today.</p>

<p>A little background: Zelda has been in the park for nearly a decade, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141011003455/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/zelda_still_kickin_in_battery_park.php">was named after</a> F. Scott&apos;s wife Zelda Fitzgerald, because during one of Mrs. F&apos;s many nervous breakdowns she went missing and was discovered in Battery Park.</p>
