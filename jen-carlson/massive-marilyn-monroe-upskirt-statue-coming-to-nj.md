<p>Is there really no space for this massive thing in NYC? This Seward Johnson statue of Marilyn Monroe has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012417/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/15/giant_marilyn_monroe_statue_is_a_mo.php#photo-1">to Chicago</a>, and now will travel to New Jersey&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012417/http://www.groundsforsculpture.org/">Grounds For Sculpture</a>, but has yet to be in New York... where the iconic pose was first captured during filming of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012417/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/06/movie_flashback.php#photo-1"><em>The 7 Year Itch</em></a>. </p>

<p>The massive Marilyn will be part of &quot;the largest and most significant exhibition in its history&#x2014;a presentation of work by Seward Johnson&quot; featuring 150 sculptures, including one that captures that famous kiss in Times Square. The exhibition will also include work from Seward&apos;s homage to the Impressionist painters, where he has transformed well-known paintings (like Claude Monet&#x2019;s Garden at Sainte-Addresse and Edouard Manet&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509012417/http://www.groundsforsculpture.org/Artwork/Dejeuner-D-j-Vu">Le Dejeuner sur l&#x2019;herbe</a>) into life-sized three-dimensional tableaux. </p>

<p>According to the press release we received, the works will be installed in three indoor galleries, as well as across the 42-acre park, starting May 4th (and running through September 21st). Grounds For Sculpture is located at 19 Fairgrounds Road in Hamilton, NJ... and this exhibit seems like it will be worth the drive.</p>
