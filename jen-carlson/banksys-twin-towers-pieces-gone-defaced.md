<p>Sometime between yesterday morning and last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161250/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s Twin Towers piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161250/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/theres_a_2nd_911_tribute_from_banks.php#photo-1">in Brooklyn Heights</a> was buffed, which may have been the work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161250/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/nypd_intent_on_bringing_banksy_to_j.php">of the city</a> (according to a certain tabloid, they&apos;ve been &quot;hunting&quot; the elusive street artist). The piece didn&apos;t last a week, but during its time up in the Fruit Street Sitting Area it was never defaced, and the yellow flower that was stuck in it was never removed. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161250/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/banksy_puts_up_tribute_to_twin_towe.php#photo-1">the Twin Towers piece in TriBeca</a> has been subject to more attention. Since Tuesday it&apos;s become something of shrine, with flowers placed next to it, as well as a letter asking haters not to touch it. Eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161250/https://twitter.com/tribecacitizen/status/390853341867040768">some plexiglass</a> was placed over it in an effort to preserve it, but last night someone covered it all with black paint: </p>

<p>This is why we can&apos;t have nice things, etc...</p>
