<p>Just one day after we took a look at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210182530/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/01/new_bench.php">disappearing iconic wooden benches</a> of New York City&apos;s streets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210182530/http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/the-art-of-styling-the-subways-slow-down-and-look-around-1.2252334">amNewYork</a> warns that the benches underground may be on their way out as well. Sitting in the city will never be the same!</p>

<p>The paper reports that a redesign may be in the future, noting that NYC Transit officials are trying to decide if sleeker stainless steel seats should replace the standard wooden ones in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210182530/http://gothamist.com/tags/secondavenuesubway">Second Avenue Subway</a> and No. 7 extension stations. Allegedly, &quot;designers are having a vigorous debate between the two models, with some viewing the steel as cold, while others blasting the wood as unhygienic.&quot; Expect prototypes to be installed at yet-to-be-disclosed stations in the coming months. Let&apos;s just hope stainless steel repels <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210182530/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bed bugs</a>. (If you spot one of the new prototypes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210182530/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">give us ring</a>!)</p>

<p>As an interesting bit of history, amNY points out that the masterminds behind the subway wanted it to be a &#x201C;very pleasing feature to the traveling public&quot; and believe it &quot;should be a work of art, in keeping with the era&#x2019;s &apos;City Beautiful&apos; movement.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141210182530/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2010/09/02/iconic-wooden-subway-benches-on-the-way-out/">2nd Ave. Sagas</a>]</p>
