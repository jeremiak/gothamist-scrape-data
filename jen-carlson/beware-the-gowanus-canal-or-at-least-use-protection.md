According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624063045/http://scienceline.org/2007/09/26/env-phillips-gowanus/">a Scienceline article</a>, &quot;a biologist at the New York City College of Technology, has her students analyze water samples and observe the oily substance that coats the water&#x2019;s surface each afternoon. &apos;One group of students found gonohorrea in a water drop,&apos; said Haque. She&#x2019;s particularly interested in fluorescent white gauze that lies near the canal&#x2019;s bottom, and thinks that the substance is a colonizing life form that adheres to the contaminated sediments.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly looking at these recent photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624063045/http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2007/10/gowanus-canal-swans.html">swans on the canal</a> is less heartwarming. Green Brooklyn suggests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624063045/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.bd08ee7c7c1ffec87c4b36d501c789a0/index.jsp?doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fmail%2Fhtml%2Fmayor.html">writing a note</a> to Bloomberg to make him aware of this, especially prior to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection&apos;s stakeholder meeting later this month.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you probably don&apos;t want to date anyone in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160624063045/http://www.waterfrontmuseum.org/dredgers">The Gowanus Dredgers canoe club</a>.</p>
