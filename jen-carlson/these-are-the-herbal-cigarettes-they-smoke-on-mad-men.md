<p>At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073702/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/things_we_learned_at_a_mad_men_qa_l.php">the <em>Mad Men</em> Q&amp;A; at the Paley Center earlier this week</a>, the cast discussed smoking on the show, noting they smoke herbal cigarettes made of &quot;rose petals, marshmallow... no nicotine or tar.&quot; It&apos;s always been known they aren&apos;t puffing down real Lucky Strikes, but what is their herbal brand of choice? There are a few options out there but we were told by the folks at <em>Mad Men</em> today that their brand is Ecstacy. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="joansmoking0413.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073702im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/joansmoking0413.jpg" width="268" height="283" class="image-right"> </span>There&apos;s actually no mention of marshmallows in Ecstacy herbal cigs, although the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073702/http://www.honeyroseusa.com/">Honeyrose brand</a> does offer herbal smokes with &quot;marshmallow leaves and rose petals.&quot; And while Ecstacy touts their &quot;all-natural herbs that are 100% tobacco and nicotine free&quot; as a &quot;terrific substitute for tobacco and great for anyone looking to quit smoking,&quot; keep in mind that smoking <em>anything</em> is worse for you than smoking nothing (end PSA). From the Q&amp;A; on Tuesday:</p>

<p><strong>Brian Williams:</strong> What is in the cigarettes you guys love smoking?<br>
<strong>John Slattery:</strong> &#x2026;fake cigarettes&#x2026;those are herbal cigarettes, who knows what&#x2019;s in them&#x2026;rose petals, marshmallows, I don&#x2019;t know.<br>
<strong>January Jones:</strong> I found a piece of plastic in one&#x2026;<br>
<strong>JS:</strong> (pointing) Plastic, very healthy.<br>
<strong>BW:</strong> But you inhale a lot!<br>
<strong>John Hamm:</strong> Yeah, there&#x2019;s just no nicotine or tar&#x2026;which makes them VERY healthy.<br>
(laughter)<br>
<strong>BW:</strong> Because you guys probably inhale cumulatively 80,000 of them each!<br>
<strong>JH:</strong> Yeah, we should really own stock in the company.</p>

<p>Last year Jon Hamm discussed his character&apos;s smoking habit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073702/http://o.canada.com/2012/12/29/mad-men-actors-forced-to-smoke-herbal-cigarettes/">in an interview</a>, claiming that he smoked <em>74 cigarettes</em> while shooting the pilot alone&#x2014;&#x201C;You have to remember, though, that shooting a scene is not shooting one take of a scene. It&#x2019;s four or five setups, and three or four takes on each setup. So every time you see me light a cigarette, I do it five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 times.&quot; As a result, he said, &#x201C;You can hear from my voice that it&#x2019;s a debilitating endeavour. We&#x2019;re going for verisimilitude, though. People did smoke. And it creates a mood on the show.&quot; At Tuesday&apos;s Q&amp;A;, the cast mentioned that the cigarettes are burned down for them to the exact point they need to be at when shooting a scene&#x2014;so at least they aren&apos;t frantically huffing a new one down each take.</p>

<p>To look further into whether there can be a lesser of two evils here, we plan on sticking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073702/http://twitter.com/christrobbins">Chris Robbins</a> into a room with a carton of these and a direct line to the FDA until he comes out with a long form article on herbal cigarettes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073702/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/22/e-cigs_e-cigarettes_njoy_vaping_vap.php">&#xE0; la his informative e-cigarettes piece</a>.</p>
