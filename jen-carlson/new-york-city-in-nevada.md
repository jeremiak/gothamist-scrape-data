<p>We&apos;ve never been all that intrigued by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003902/http://www.burningman.com/">Burning Man</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003902/http://blog.limewire.com/posts/459-Burning-Man-Pictures-Of-Our-Camp">Limewire has some great photos</a> of the recent annual desert voyage that make it look more appealing than appalling. </p>

<p>That&apos;s right, someone - actually the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003902/http://www.openplans.org/">Open Planning Project</a> - recreated New York City right there in the Black Rock Desert. It sort of begs the question &quot;why leave New York in the first place?&quot; but you&apos;ve gotta hand it to them for even including such details as the Astor Cube and rats in the subway. Though we&apos;re not too sure we&apos;ve ever seen a bus stop that looks like theirs -- check it out in the series of photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003902/http://blog.limewire.com/posts/459-Burning-Man-Pictures-Of-Our-Camp">here</a>. </p>

<p>And Open Planning Projects has worked in NYC - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003902/http://www.openplans.org/projects/park-ing-day">Park(ing) Day</a>, for instance.</p>
