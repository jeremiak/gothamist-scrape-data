<p>The $150MM facelift for the New York Aquarium has been in the works for over a year now, but the Wildlife Conservation Society hasn&apos;t given many hints about what the new look will be like. Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520025721/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703727804576017883339171002.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTSecondStories">Wall Street Journa</a>l has some details, noting that the plan will add a 1,000-foot spiral ramp, a sparkling aluminum facade, a roof deck with an oceanview and special tanks featuring local species. The added 50,000-square-feet will house a 500,000 tank filled with sharks, sea turtles, and thousands of fish... but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520025721/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/03/peta_wants_mermaids.php">no mermaids</a>.</p>

<p>Work won&apos;t begin until 2012, and won&apos;t be completed until 2015... in the meantime, the WCS is looking to raise more money, which shouldn&apos;t be a problem since it&apos;s an integral part of the Bloomberg administration&apos;s push to rejuvenate Coney Island and make it a year-round destination spot.</p>
