The couple&#x2014;spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813021731/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/03/photos_celebs_celebrate_mcqueen_at.php#photo-4">at the Met</a> earlier this week&#x2014;have been together for four years, and just got engaged. The 51-year-old Shevell&apos;s term on the MTA Board will end <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813021731/http://www.mta.info/mta/leadership/shevell.htm">in June</a>, and we&apos;re <em>guessing</em> she won&apos;t return.</p>

<p>A source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813021731/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20487605,00.html">People</a> it&apos;s really happening, there&apos;s &quot;a ring and all.&quot; (Will the knighted Beatles&apos; big day rival the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813021731/http://gothamist.com/tags/royalwedding">Royal Wedding</a>?) This is the 68-year-old McCartney&apos;s third marriage, and in 2008 he declared: &quot;I just like being in love.&quot; <em>Awwww.</em> </p>

<p>Though one skeptic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813021731/http://twitter.com/#!/theschmeltz/status/66525691050598400">Tweeted</a>, &quot;Paul McCartney to wed MTA Board Member Nancy Shevell. But don&apos;t worry, he&apos;ll divorce her after he waits 40 minutes for the G Train.&quot;</p>
