<blockquote>A new spirit has been released at the 144-year-old cemetery with the transfer of the cemetery&#x2019;s vast archives to the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library of Columbia University. The trove includes architectural designs, maps, photographs, letters and mausoleum blueprints &#x2014; some 800 linear feet. The size of the collection is unsurprising; with more than 300,000 burials and 1,300 family mausoleums, Woodlawn is the world capital of mausoleums.</blockquote>

<p>Amongst the documents already on view are a bank envelope with Duke Ellington&#x2019;s signature and a sketch for Miles Davis&#x2019;s burial lot monument. The entire undertaking is projected to take five years and $850,000 to process. The files which have not been properly examined yet contain some familiar names: Herman Melville, Fiorello La Guardia, Joseph Pulitzer, the Juilliards and many more.</p>

<p>Cemeteries are known for keep meticulous records, making this - as Gerald Beasley, the library&#x2019;s director, coined it, &quot;a collective memory of the city,&quot; while The Times notes that &quot;the archives may prove the Bronx equivalent of the grave of King Tut.&quot;</p>
