<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063101/http://gothamist.com/tags/michelgondry">Michel Gondry</a>&apos;s next film is a world away from his last big budget flick, <em>The Green Hornet</em>, and back to what he does best with his trademark cinemalism. This doesn&apos;t mean you should expect whimsical cardboard boxes creating the scenery, however. The film, premiering at Cannes later this month, takes place almost entirely inside of a New York City bus in the Bronx. </p>

<p>The stars are 35 kids (to our knowledge none of them trained actors), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063101/https://vimeo.com/42196182#embed">the plotline reads</a> that it&apos;s a &quot;heartfelt and comical story of the final bus ride home for a group of young high school students and graduates. As kids depart the bus for the last time, we get to learn about these graduates as they step into the world&#x2014;their love, their conflicts, their despair and their hope.&quot; </p>

<p>However, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063101/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1618445/"><em>IMDB</em></a>, even though people are describing this as Gondry&apos;s most realistic film to date, the movie is categorized as sci-fi. Last year Gondry addressed this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120528063101/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/michel_gondrys_we_the_i_shooting_now_centers_on_a_youthful_time_machine_pre">in an interview</a>, saying that the kids &quot;travel into the future by mistake and discover a machine that keeps people younger.&quot; None of this is shown in this trailer.</p>
