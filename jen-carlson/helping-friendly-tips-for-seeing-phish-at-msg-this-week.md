<p>Have you heard? <em>Dozens</em> were arrested outside of Madison Square Garden over the weekend as the long-haired rock and roll group Phish were set to play their first show in a four night run, which will wrap up in the early morning hours of January 1st.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/29/phish_madison_square_garden_28.php">Our intrepid reporter was there,</a> and narrowly escaped the mass arrests, probably with the help of Clive Owen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/phish_fan_crawls_through_sewars_for.php">and some sewer drains</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2xGWF9K8JQ">Julianne Moore didn&apos;t make it</a>). </p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131229/midtown-south/dozens-arrested-outside-msg-at-first-of-phishs-pre-new-years-shows">DNAInfo</a> reported that there were around 60 arrests, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/school-phish-fans-busted-madison-square-garden-article-1.1561254">the Daily News</a> later reported it was more like 38, mostly for drug-related infractions. Look, that&apos;s not nothing but... that&apos;s kind of nothing! At their Hampton shows in Virginia in 2009, a record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://www.examiner.com/article/hampton-arrests-make-phish-phans-look-ridiculous">240 were arrested</a>, with around $1.2 million in illegal drugs confiscated. </p>

<p>We didn&apos;t notice a larger police presence than previous years, but a source tells DNAInfo that the number of arrests is &quot;much more than usual.&quot; So with two nights left, let&apos;s go over a few common sense rules: </p>

<p><strong>Tickets</strong>: Hopefully if you are selling your tickets they are for face value and not a jacked up price (in which case you deserve to get arrested and you can stop reading now). If you are kindly selling your extra for exactly what you paid (or less! Or Miracle-ing someone!) then you might want to do that a few blocks away from MSG. Maybe meet at a bar, or in a dark alley... anywhere but MSG, where The Man is watching.</p>

<p><strong>Drugs</strong>: Aren&apos;t you a little <em>old</em> to be doing drugs? That is your decision, and hey some of that stuff should be legal anyway. But doing drugs or selling drugs or just touching drugs is not a good idea when you&apos;re standing outside of a massive venue where a band that has put so many of the kids of shady <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/11/51_nitrous_oxid.html">dental anesthetic distributors</a> through college is about to perform. The NYPD would love to take your &quot;hippie&quot; ass down to the precinct for pulling out that one-hitter. So do your drugs at home, or in that dark alley where you just scored a ticket.</p>

<p><strong>Your Drunk Friend</strong>: Did your buddy go a little overboard pre-gaming? Or maybe he took some of those substances we discussed earlier? Does it seem like he may <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://phantasytour.com/bands/1/topics/3636543/posts">get ejected</a> from the venue? Take him home before he does. Tell him you&apos;ll see Phish &quot;tomorrow,&quot; there&apos;s always &quot;tomorrow.&quot; (Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173658/http://livephish.com/">put the livestream</a> on his Visa gift card he got from grandma.)</p>
