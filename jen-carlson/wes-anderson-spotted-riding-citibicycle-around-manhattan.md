title: Wes Anderson Spotted Riding Citibicycle Around Manhattan
---

	
										<p><em>Wes Anderson bought a Citbike membership in the summer of his forty-sixth year. The uniformity of bikeshare programs appealed to him, though he preferred to call it a Citibicycle. He also really wished they had gone with a color that wasn&apos;t so... primary. His therapist believed that riding the blue bike in public would help with his Heinsbergen syndrome, which lately had really started to creatively and aesthetically box him in.</em></p>

<p>Wearing a taupe seersucker suit, with a hint of baby blue peeking out from the cuffs, Anderson pedaled around Manhattan yesterday in suede earth-toned footwear. At stop lights, he pulled out a perfectly folded newspaper from the bicycle&apos;s basket and caught up on the day&apos;s stories.</p>

<p>But this Citibicycle is just all wrong for the shot, Anderson thought. On top of that basic blue, there&apos;s the FONT. And no sidecar with a wincing Bill Murray holding a portable record player, playing old Kinks b-sides?</p>

<p>Witnesses saw Anderson throw the Citibike down, then heard him curse his therapist and call Jason Schwartzman, who arrived shortly thereafter on a mint-turquoise <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102704/http://www.hammacher.com/Product/14184?cm_cat=ProductSEM&amp;cm_pla=AdWordsPLA&amp;source=PRODSEM&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwjMauBRDH-bOCo56b13wSJABA2-HvfDAfHGs7EiEnorN-LyRf5xTkrHLhSq-EAQJKdRSKWhoCCHrw_wcB">pedal surrey</a>, which seemed to calm Anderson down almost immediately.</p>
