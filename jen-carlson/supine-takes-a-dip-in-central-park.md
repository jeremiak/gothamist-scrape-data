<p>Street artist Judith Supine installed this piece in Central Park yesterday, telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406200748/http://www.woostercollective.com/2009/05/jusith_supine_in_central_park.html">Wooster Collective</a>, &quot;I sank in the mud up to my waist.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406200748/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/05/judith_supine_t.php">Two years ago</a> a Supine creation briefly hung off the Manhattan Bridge over the East River. Perhaps a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140406200748/http://gothamist.com/tags/superfund">Superfund</a>-themed Supine will visit the Gowanus?</p>
