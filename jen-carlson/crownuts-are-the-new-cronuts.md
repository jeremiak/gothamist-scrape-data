<p>The totally unique human unicorn behind the Cinnamon Snail, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093339/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/cinnamon_snail_adam_sobel.php">Adam Sobel</a>, has gone to a bit of a dark place for his latest creation: the Crownut. </p>

<p>Tired of being asked to create a vegan version of Dominique Ansel&apos;s Cronut&#xAE;, he stepped outside the pastry box and put his own spin on the thing. The Crownut taps into the spirit of the 1994 film <em>The Crow</em>, which was pretty beloved by angsty, sad teens listening to NIN on repeat at the time. Or so we hear. <em>The Crow</em> was solid (Roger Ebert called it &quot;stunning&quot;), but is mostly known for being the movie that star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093339/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_(1994_film)#Brandon_Lee.27s_death">Brandon Lee</a> was filming when he died from a gunshot wound on set.</p>

<p>Sobel says, &quot;By now, every damned place including Dunkin&apos; Donuts makes some rip off version of Dominique Ansel&apos;s Cronut pastry invention. We have been asked too many times to make a vegan rendition of this desert, but we aren&#x2019;t into ripping off other people&#x2019;s creative ideas. So today, exclusively at our location in The Pennsy food hall on 33rd street and 7th avenue in Manhattan we are offering a limited number of: Crownuts!&quot;</p>

<p>The Crownut is a peanut butter chocolate cheesecake stuffed vegan donut, with Lee as The Crow expertly painted in icing on top. The Crownut can&apos;t &quot;bring that soul back to put the wrong things right,&quot; but it is probably pretty tasty.</p>
