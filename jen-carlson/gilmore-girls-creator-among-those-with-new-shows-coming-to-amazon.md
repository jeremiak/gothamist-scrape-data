<p>Here is some very good news: <em>Gilmore Girls</em> creator Amy Sherman-Palladino&apos;s new series, <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em>, will hit Amazon on March 17th. Well, sort of. </p>

<p>They&apos;re doing that thing again where viewers get the pilot and then &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905200852/https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Pilot-Season/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9940930011">help determine</a>&quot; if it will be picked up. If it is, like a year later you get the full series. This was kind of fun at first, but Amazon should just give the greenlight to certain projects, like this already anticipated one, rather than making proven showrunners jump through hoops. </p>

<p>According to today&apos;s press release, the show is &quot;about a 1958 New York City woman who goes from uptown housewife to stand-up comic in Greenwich Village.&quot; The series stars Rachel Brosnahan (<em>House of Cards</em>) and Tony Shalhoub (<em>Monk</em>).</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Maisel</em> will be joined by four other Amazon originals, also hitting the streaming service on the 17th: </p>

<ul><li>Richard Madden (<em>Game of Thrones</em>), Haley Joel Osment (<em>The Sixth Sense</em>) and Anil Kapoor (<em>24</em>) will star in sci-fi series <em>Oasis</em>, which follows a chaplain who is sent into space to help establish a colony on a distant planet.
</li><li>John Hawkes (<em>Winter&#x2019;s Bone</em>), Dawnn Lewis (<em>Major Crimes</em>) and Shea Whigham (<em>Boardwalk Empire</em>) will star in <em>The Legend of Master Legend</em>, a dark comedy about the life of Frank Lafount, aka Master Legend&#x2014;a homemade superhero whose mission is to protect the people of Las Vegas from evil doers.
</li><li>Joel David Moore (<em>Bones</em>), Will Sasso (<em>MADtv</em>) and Brett Gelman (<em>Fleabag</em>) in a 1980s stoner comedy called <em>Budding Prospects</em>.
</li><li>Ben Schwartz (<em>Parks and Recreation</em>), Matt Braunger (<em>Agent Carter</em>), Missi Pyle (<em>Gone Girl</em>) and Jonathan Adams (<em>Last Man Standing</em>) in animated adult series <em>The New V.I.P.&#x2019;s</em>, which &quot;follows a group of low level employees who seize control of a major corporation after accidentally murdering their boss.&quot;</li></ul>
