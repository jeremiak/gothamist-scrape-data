</div></div>					<p>The Standard debuted their ice skating rink last year, and today they&apos;re reopening it for another winter season, complete with an all-new menu, which includes boozy beverages... because it&apos;s always a good idea to take the edge off before strapping sharp blades to your feet and stepping on to some ice? Choose your poison:</p>

<blockquote>Hot cocktails perfect for the holiday season include steamed egg nog, sparkling hard apple cider, Gl&#xFC;hwein and the Standard hot toddy.  Super rich hot chocolate comes in white, dark or peanut butter and can be topped with marshmallow or crushed peppermint candy cane.  Coffee, tea, wine and soft drinks are also served and all beverages can be spiked for those who want to put some extra pep in their skate.</blockquote>

<p>Luckily, there&apos;s also absorbent food in case you drink one too many spiked egg nogs. We&apos;re told guests can get their glutt on with a choice of Belgian waffles, soups, and sweet &amp; savory crepes (Nutella! Banana! Ham &amp; Gruyere!).</p>

<p>Hours are Monday through Thursday, from noon to midnight, Friday from noon to 1 a.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m., and Sunday from 9 a.m. to midnight. A general skate ticket costs $12, and a skate rental is just 3 bucks.<br>
