<p>Before the Cyclone, Coney Island was home to the Switchback Railway, which opened on June 16th, 1884. It was not only Coney&apos;s first roller coaster, but America&apos;s first roller coaster! The ol&apos; gal would be 131 today if she weren&apos;t unceremoniously demolished (presumably).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022182751/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-roller-coaster-in-america-opens">the History Channel</a>, the 600-foot-long coaster was the brainchild of LaMarcus Thompson, and it traveled approximately 6 MPH at just 50-feet above the ground. Today the tallest in North America <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022182751/https://www.sixflags.com/greatadventure/attractions/kingda-ka">is 456-feet</a>, and The Cyclone&#x2014;which arrived at Coney Island in 1927&#x2014;is 85-feet tall. Thompson was reportedly inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022182751/http://entertainmentdesigner.com/history-of-theme-parks/the-history-of-roller-coasters-the-mauch-chunk-gravity-railway/">the Mauch Chuk Switchback Railway in Pennsylvania</a>, which was a mine train that became a tourist attraction.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022182751/http://www.coneyislandhistory.org/index.php?g=hall_of_fame&amp;s=thompson">Coney Island History Project</a> notes that the Switchback (which stood where the Cyclone is today), &quot;was not a round-trip ride. The passengers left the car, which was then turned around and sent back to the start.&quot; You can get an idea of what it was like in this video: </p>

<p>The ride cost a nickel, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022182751/http://www.westland.net/coneyisland/articles/coasterlist.htm">it&apos;s believed</a> Thompson&#x2014;who is known as the Father of Gravity&#x2014;grossed an average of $600/day before competition started rolling in. He went on to form the L. A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company, which he ran out of 220 West 42nd Street&#x2014;through that he developed more rides for Coney Island, including a scenic railway that was partially destroyed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022182751/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/firemen-at-the-scene-of-a-fire-on-the-worlds-longest-scenic-news-photo/3063199">during the 1944 fire</a>.</p>
