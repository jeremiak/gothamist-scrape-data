<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> East Village vegetarian haven&#x2014;and organic bar!&#x2014;Counter is closing. (A moment of silence please.) Last night owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520025751/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/20/deborah_gavito_counter.php">Deborah Gavito</a> sent out an email to her hungry masses which said she sold the restaurant after 8 years in business, and she would be closing up shop sometime in February. For neighborhood vegetarians, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520025751/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/30/john_norris_mtv_news.php">John Norris</a> has some tips on where to fill the void: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520025751/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/11/amanda_cohen.php">Dirt Candy</a>, on E 9th St., the old standby Kate&apos;s Joint, Gobo.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Gavito for more details surrounding the closing, but in her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520025751/http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?llr=tsb57qbab&amp;v=001GqPuXdeqXXCTGVZfP_GktM1Z_wfA8RRW2o8SyOSin5p02N9VirIobURxTJlLA5kOfM_qjjhtn_zG9PxZ9VL8mIBgTv2EOc0PHw5jZ5d5cIE%3D">mass email</a> she noted that she &quot;will be focusing on my bakery business, Body &amp; Soul&quot; (which you can find at Union Square and other Greenmarkets). She also plans to open a vegetarian restaurant in Brooklyn with Counter&apos;s chef and its manager, which will be a shared endeavor. Gavito had always been tinkering with a little rooftop garden at Counter, so perhaps this new space will allow her to expand that. And maybe a cheaper lease in Brooklyn will bring down some of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520025751/http://www.counternyc.com/#/menus">those prices</a>!</p>

And until that last slice of seitan is served up, they&apos;ll be offering some specials. Check them out below, and head over before they dim the lights on 1st Avenue.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Grilled pizza night. Get a free glass of wine with purchase of grilled pizza.<br>
<strong>Wednesday:</strong> Soup night. Get a free soup with purchase of entree. <br>
<strong>Thursday:</strong> Mulled cider night. Warm up with a house-mulled cider. Buy one get one free!<br>
<strong>Friday:</strong> Date night. For every date they&apos;ll throw in two glasses of cava! <br>
<strong>Sunday:</strong> Free dessert night. Free dessert with purchase of entree, and free hot chocolate with brunch!</p>

<p>Planning on going vegetarian in 2011? Get a head start and hit up Counter&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve prix fixe. For 40 bucks you&apos;ll get spicy chickpea soup, bourbon glazed seitan, truffled smashed potatoes, and a mess &apos;o greens. Plus gingerbread cake and a glass of bubbly!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Gavito tells us they are looking to open the new place in either Williamsburg or Greenpoint. She notes they were not priced out of the East Village, but rather she &quot;decided to simplify&quot; her life and &quot;the day to day grind of running a restaurant became less and less appealing.&quot; For the Brooklyn establishment, she says &quot;I love my chef Elena Balletta.  She&apos;s talented, young and energetic.  I&apos;m going to help finance her restaurant, but I want absolutely nothing to do with running it.  I would like to set it up like a little coop so everyone gets a little bit more than a paycheck out if it.&quot;</p>
