Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/30/judy_blume_book_lost_divorce.php">we posted</a> about a Brooklyn man who had tossed his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/http://www.amazon.com/Wifey-Judy-Blume/dp/0425206548/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438348928&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=judy+blume">Wifey</a>&apos;s treasured book into a box headed for the curb. The book was claimed before the husband knew what he had done. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/http://www.amazon.com/Unlikely-Event-Judy-Blume/dp/1101875046/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438348928&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=judy+blume">In The Unlikely Event</a> the person who took it would see his appeal, he put up some flyers in Greenpoint:<p></p>

<blockquote>I accidentally gave this book away on Saturday July 25th in a box on the corner of Green &amp; Franklin. This book is extremely important to my wife. It was a keepsake from her mother and is irreplaceable. On the inside cover is a note that reads &#x201C;Christmas 1991.&#x201D; If you happened to pick up this book can you please get in touch with me.</blockquote>

<p>The flyer circulated through a series of stories online, and eventually reached this story&apos;s hero, Judy Blume, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/https://twitter.com/judyblume/status/626884085265379328">tweeted last night</a>: &quot;Oh no tragic! Will send signed copy. Not the same, I know. Let&apos;s hope it saves the marriage. Not sure I can find that cover but will try. Trying to make contact w/Husb who gave away wife&apos;s copy of &apos;Margaret.&apos; Need snail mail address &amp; wife&apos;s first name.&quot; Later she confirmed she &quot;called and texted. Waiting for reply.&quot; </p>

<p>This morning, around 12 hours later, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/https://twitter.com/reddsauce/status/627060796422553600">Leonard Lasek replied over Twitter</a>, declaring: &quot;I&apos;m the terrible husband!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart... marriage saved!!!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-World-Judy-Blume/dp/1481411160/ref=sr_1_20?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438348714&amp;sr=8-20&amp;keywords=judy+blume">It&apos;s Not The End Of The World</a>! </p>

<p>Blume seems to have confirmed Lasek is indeed &quot;the terrible husband,&quot; and Tweeted at him one more time before headed off on vacation:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/https://twitter.com/reddsauce">@reddsauce</a>-and you were just married! I take this as a good omen. Still think Katie&apos;s book will show up but I&apos;m on the case. Flying today.</p>&#x2014; Judy Blume (@judyblume) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/https://twitter.com/judyblume/status/627105333790511104">July 31, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Blume for comment, as well as Lasek, and will update if we hear back. But for now it looks like this couple will be together <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228121823/http://www.amazon.com/Forever-Richard-Jackson-Book/dp/1481414437/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438348928&amp;sr=8-16&amp;keywords=judy+blume">Forever...</a></p>

<p>Stay tuned for Chapter 3, where a kind stranger returns the real copy of the book.</p>
