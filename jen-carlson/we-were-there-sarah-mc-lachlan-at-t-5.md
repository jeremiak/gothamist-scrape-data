</div></div>					<p>Last night Sarah McLachlan took the stage at Terminal 5... but not the venue in Manhattan, the JetBlue terminal at JFK Airport! The scene was not dissimilar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000123/http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/4a87d48fdd/undercover-karaoke-with-jewel">this Funny Or Die clip</a> of Jewel showing up at a karaoke bar&#x2014;McLachlan&apos;s piano was set up post-security, right in the middle of where travelers were arriving and departing. The singer just released her new album <em>Laws of Illusion</em> and is in town for the latest stop on her Lilith Fair tour (taking place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000123/http://www.lilithfair.com/events/New-York-NY/195/info">tomorrow</a>).</p>

<p>The Live from T5 concert series kicked off last year, and was developed by Superfly, the producers of Bonnaroo. While the shows can only be attended by travelers, there are a few more coming up (though the lineup has yet to be announced)&#x2014;so don&apos;t be surprised if you catch a well-known performer next time you&apos;re waiting for your flight. Maybe one day JetBlue will even host in-flight concerts (like in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000123/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYKLmlMauOE"><em>The Wedding Singer</em></a>!).</p>
