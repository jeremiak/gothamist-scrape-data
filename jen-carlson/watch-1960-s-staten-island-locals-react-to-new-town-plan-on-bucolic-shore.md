<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062127/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/01/verrazano_bridge_flashback.php">the Verrazano Bridge</a> opened in 1964, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062127/http://gothamist.com/tags/statenisland">Staten Island</a> saw rapid development, and locals were fighting to preserve their home. Some of the area had been designated for urban renewal, and citizens saw this urban renewal plan as a political tool being used to control development and tell them what to do with their property. As cookie cutter homes popped up, there was resistance to their lack of individuality.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve lived on the island my whole life,&quot; one woman declares, &quot;It used to be beautiful, but it&apos;s not beautiful no more. We don&apos;t even have trees anymore. They&apos;re putting houses up like boxes.&quot;</p>

<p>The city (and Robert Moses) was taking an interest in &quot;the forgotten borough&quot; whether the locals wanted it or not, and Mayor Lindsay had established a Staten Island Development Agency, where the city&apos;s goal was &quot;to build and develop a community of very high quality, open to all income levels, which uses modern planning concepts [like] cul-de-sacs,&quot; borough development director Holt Meyer explained. &quot;We also want to see a variety of housing types there. We want NYC to catch up [with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062127/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_towns_movement">New Town concepts</a>]... and in fact we have an opportunity to do what no other city has done because we have this vacant land. We want it to be a showcase.&quot; At the time there were 16,000 undeveloped acres on the island, more than half the city&apos;s vacant land at the time.</p>

<p>The development of the island was well reported on as the political interest of the city was clashing with the interest of the borough, and in one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062127/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9805E1D6153FE53BBC4153DFB767838C679EDE">NY Times article</a> from 1967, Borough President Connor spoke of the planned communities: &quot;Often [their] glossy brochures turn out to be just folded baloney.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s a look at the island during its big time of change:</p>
