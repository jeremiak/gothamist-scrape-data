</div></div>					<p>The upcoming 5th season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145759/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> (which starts this Sunday!) will take place in 1966, a few years into the future from when we last saw Don Draper &amp; Co. Here&apos;s a look back at New York City that year&#x2014;a year that The Beatles came to NYC (just after John Lennon declared them to be &quot;bigger than Jesus&quot;), Bob Dylan gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145759/http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/66-jan.htm">candid interview with Playboy</a>, John Lindsay was serving his first mayoral term, the gorgeous Pennsylvania Station was fully demolished, we had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428145759/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/24/smog.php#photo-4">the smoggiest day in the city&apos;s history</a>, The NY Times called Hunter S. Thompson&apos;s <em>Hell&apos;s Angels</em> an &quot;angry, knowledgeable, fascinating and excitedly written book,&quot; and construction was started on the World Trade Center.
