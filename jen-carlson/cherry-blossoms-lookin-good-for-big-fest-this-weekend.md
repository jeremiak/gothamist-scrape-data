	<p>Doesn&apos;t this weather make you want to take a snooze under some gorgeous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004709/http://gothamist.com/tags/cherryblossoms">cherry blossom trees</a> as the sun streaks through their branches and gently caresses your cheek?</p>

<p>This morning we checked out the trees at Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where they&apos;re getting ready for the big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004709/http://www.bbg.org/visit/event/sakura_matsuri_2013">Sakura Matsuri festival this weekend</a>. Dancers from the Japanese Folk Dance Institute of New York and several members of BBG&apos;s Parasol Society dressed in cosplay style as Victorian maidens and Tokyo goth girls for the press preview of the grounds prior to the big weekend. There are dozens of flowering trees in the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden that are currently in PEAK BLOOM, while &quot;the 76 Prunus Kanzan trees on Cherry Esplanade have yet to flower&#x2014;and with high temperatures in the next few days should be blooming for the weekend.&quot; In previous years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004709/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/brooklyn_botanic_gardens_cherry_blo.php">there have been some issues</a> with synching up the trees in their peak condition with the festival, because nature.<br>
 <br>
The Garden&apos;s two day fest &quot;features over 60 performances, demonstrations, and exhibits&#x2014;many of which are specially commissioned for this dynamic festival&#x2014;that showcase the best of traditional and contemporary Japanese culture.&quot; You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004709/http://www.bbg.org/visit/event/sakura_matsuri_2013">find more details here</a>... but maybe if you just want to enjoy the trees and some solitude, head over there before things kick off. And let us know what you think of the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004709/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/04/a_new_tree_house_at_brooklyn_botani.php">tree house</a>.&quot;</p>
