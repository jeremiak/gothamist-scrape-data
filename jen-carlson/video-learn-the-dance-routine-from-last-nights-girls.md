<p>On last night&apos;s episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530195957/http://gothamist.com/tags/girls"><em>Girls</em></a> the group heads out to the Hamptons... scratch that, to the North Fork, which as Marnie points out is &quot;very different... it&apos;s for people who think the Hamptons are tacky and don&apos;t want to be on a beach that&apos;s near a J. Crew.&quot; (Shhhh don&apos;t tell them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530195957/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/montauk.php">about Montauk</a>.) During their time there they break out into a synchronized dance routine, harkening back to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530195957/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqiYAp4hxAU"><em>Freddie Prinze Jr.-era</em></a> of rom coms. Do you want to learn the routine? Then play this video over and over and over again until you NAIL IT, just like you did with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160530195957/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/435525662078558208">Janet Jackson&apos;s &quot;If&quot; routine</a> when you were in middle school.</p>
