Meanwhile, over on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150619/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11262008/gossip/pagesix/law__ledger_140897.htm">Page Six</a> there&apos;s talk of (sigh) a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150619/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/22/heath_ledger_fo.php">Heath Ledger</a>-esque Law &amp; Order. They report that the plot &quot;is &apos;supposed to be about Heath Ledger&apos; and features a male supermodel, played by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150619/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516796/">Ryan Locke</a>, who &apos;has a great career and gets all the ladies.&apos; Perhaps the eeriest comparison is to Ledger&apos;s actual death by overdose when the character &apos;leaves a club with a girl. They have sex and do drugs, and the next morning, his friend finds him dead.&apos;&quot; Next up: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150619/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/26/teen_model_in_teacher_sex_scandal_b.php">Joshua Walter and Gina Salamino</a>?</p>
