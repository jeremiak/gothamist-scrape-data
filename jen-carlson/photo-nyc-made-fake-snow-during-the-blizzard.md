<span class="photo_caption">Central Park is running snowmakers today. (Gothamist)</span></p>

<p>This afternoon we received the above photo from a tipster, who remarked, &quot;Running all day. Can this be intentional?&quot; It is! Belt and suspenders, people.</p>

<p>The Parks Department press office confirms that the snow machines, set up for this weekend&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084159/http://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/festivals/winter-jam">Winter Jam</a> in Central Park, have been fully operational today. During a massive snow storm that is bringing plenty of snow to the area, followed by freezing temperatures that will keep it around for quite a while...</p>

<p>Spokesperson Meghan Lalor issued this statement: &quot;The grooming equipment we have coming in to create the snowfield at Winter Jam requires a large amount of snow, so in addition to the natural snow we&apos;re getting this week we&apos;ve decided to continue blowing snow. The snowfield will accommodate skiing and snowboarding lessons, cross country skiing, sledding, and snowshoeing.&quot; </p>

<p>And next August we look forward to huddling under the Parks Department heat lamps for warmth!</p>
