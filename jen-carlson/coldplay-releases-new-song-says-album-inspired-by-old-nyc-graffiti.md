<p>Just the other day Gwyneth Paltrow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020454/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/01/gwyneth_paltrow_is_tweeting_and_try.php">joined Twitter</a> and promptly Tweeted that the new Coldplay songs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020454/https://twitter.com/#!/GwynethPaltrow/status/76222864348561408">were &quot;genius&quot;</a>, as she listened with her kids at their dad&apos;s secret New York City show. And now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020454/http://www.coldplay.com/">the band</a> has released the first single, titled &quot;Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall.&quot; It sounds like this:</p>

<p>Last year Chris Martin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020454/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/26/new-coldplay-album-inspired-graffiti">explained</a>, &quot;The ideas come from graffiti art of the 70s in New York, where people were expressing themselves with paint. I&apos;ve spent a lot of my life playing it a bit safe or conforming to something, even though I didn&apos;t agree with it. So I have respect and admiration for people who don&apos;t.&quot; The new song doesn&apos;t <em>really</em> sound like anything inspired by old school New York graffiti, nor does it sound like &quot;not playing it safe&quot;... though as you can see in the above photo, they are embracing the image by holding a spray can.</p>
