<p>The images were all captured by photographer Christine Osinski, who moved to Staten Island from her loft in lower Manhattan in the early &apos;80s, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200618/http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/06/19/christine_osinski_staten_island_photographs_show_life_in_the_new_york_city.html">Slate</a>. She lived there for 16 years with her husband, documenting everything in black &amp; white film throughout 1983 and 1984&#x2014;these are the photographs now on display. </p>

<p>Osinksi says, &#x201C;I hope I don&#x2019;t romanticize things, but I really liked all of the crazy people and places. I was trying to figure out why I was so attracted, and I think it was because they were both exotic and familiar to me.&quot;</p>

<p><em>The exhibit will run through July 3rd at Sasha Wolf Gallery, located at 70 Orchard Street on the Lower East Side.</em></p>
