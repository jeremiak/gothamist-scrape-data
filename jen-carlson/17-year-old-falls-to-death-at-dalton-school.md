Disturbingly, news soon followed that it was a child who jumped or fell from the roof of a school (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092235/http://www.nypost.com/seven/02182009/news/regionalnews/private_school_student_falls_to_death_155780.htm">the Post</a> is reporting it was from an 11th floor window). Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092235/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/teen.falls.killed.2.937889.html">WCBS</a> sheds some more light on the incident, noting the deceased is a 17-year-old male who was found DOA outside of UES&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092235/http://www.dalton.org/">Dalton School</a> (a co-ed private school with about 1,300 students attending). No specifics as to how the fall happened have been reported, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092235/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6664760">ABC</a> notes that the school has &quot;closed all the shades to keep students inside the building from seeing the scene outside.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092235/http://www.1010wins.com/Teen-Jumps-11-Stories-to-Death-at-NYC-Prep-School/3875167">1010Wins</a> reports, &quot;Authorities said that he went to an 11th floor dance studio, opened a window and jumped on Wednesday. His mother was at the scene. The teen&apos;s brother also attends Dalton. The boy had won academic awards and was involved in school activities, including its Web site.&quot;</p>
