title: Garbage Gossip Strikes in Greenwich Village

<p><img alt="mlpweeds.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085721im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mlpweeds.jpg" width="119" height="119" class="right">Some Greenwich Village-residing celebs are finding their garbage is a goldmine for one outdoor prowler. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085721/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10272008/gossip/pagesix/prowlers_target_celebs_trash_135487.htm">The NY Post</a> notes that one recent victim is <em>Weeds</em> star Mary-Louise Parker -- and they report on the invasion of privacy by printing what the garbage gossip found, naturally. In an anonymous letter, it says the actress fills prescriptions for an underactive thyroid at Bigelow Pharmacy on 6th Avenue (good to know she pays her co-pay $20 at a time, just like the rest of us). Other famous targets have included Charlie Rose and Graydon Carter...perhaps this snoop should start sifting through the younger Hollywood set in order to come up with something a little more scandalous than legally prescribed goiter medication?</p>
