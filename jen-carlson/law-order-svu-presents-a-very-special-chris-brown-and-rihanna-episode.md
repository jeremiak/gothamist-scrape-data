<span class="photo_caption">Still from the episode via NBC</span></p>

<p>NBC&apos;s plot description reads as follows, and sounds very familiar:</p><blockquote>&quot;A promising singer is brutally attacked by her boyfriend, a popular hip hop star. ADA Barba (guest star Raul Esparza) works to build a case, but the victim refuses to aid the prosecution and, despite Detective Benson&apos;s best efforts, continues to put herself in danger. The case quickly spirals into a media circus, perpetrated by both the defendant and his uncompromising attorney&quot;</blockquote>Special appearances will be made by Perez Hilton, Dave Navarro, and Wendy Williams.<p></p>
