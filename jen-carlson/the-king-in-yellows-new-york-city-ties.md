<p><em>The King In Yellow</em> is a collection of short horror stories by author Robert W. Chambers published in 1895. While the book, as a book, has not been specifically mentioned on the new hit HBO miniseries <em>True Detective</em>, the idea of the Yellow King has&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021617/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/04/true_detective_revealed.php#photo-12">the writing is literally on the wall</a>&#x2014;and many of the show&apos;s obsessives have been rushing out to read collection of short stories before next week&apos;s finale. </p>

<p>Now, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021617/http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/">an entire SubReddit</a> with plenty of theoretical debate about this book in relation to the show (there are references to it hidden in dialogue and plain sight)&#x2014;so let&apos;s just focus on the author and the book itself, which includes ten stories. All very dark, all very weird, and all somewhat based around an imaginary play called <em>The King In Yellow</em>, &quot;a forbidden play which induces despair or madness in those who read it.&quot; And this all came from the dark, twisted mind of a native New Yorker. </p>

<p>Brooklyn-born Chambers (who went to Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, was in the Art Students&apos; League, and even had illustrations in Vogue before settling down into writing) penned the book of stories, his most well-known written work. Even if you&apos;re not into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021617/http://io9.com/the-one-literary-reference-you-must-know-to-appreciate-1523076497">the HBO series</a> that just revived it, you may be interested in reading it&#x2014;it has influenced many, including Raymond Chandler and George R. R. Martin. AND it&apos;s got a late 1800s New York City as a backdrop&#x2014;on the very first pages you&apos;ll see references to NYC&apos;s elevated rails and Madison Avenue, all intermingling with that mysterious Yellow King and someplace called Carcosa.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago we contacted the NYPL to find out if they had this book on hand, and were told they had &quot;two copies in our research collection from its earlier publication (turn of the 20th century) and are looking into ordering copies of the reprint for the circulating collection.&quot; It appears that they now have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021617/http://nypl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/20042103052907_the_king_in_yellow_(dodo_press)">15 on order</a>. Also in their collection: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021617/http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-f76b-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99">this gorgeous poster</a> (above) for the book around the time of it&apos;s publication. And finally, here&apos;s the NY Times&apos; take on the series of short stories, which they ran in 1902:</p>
