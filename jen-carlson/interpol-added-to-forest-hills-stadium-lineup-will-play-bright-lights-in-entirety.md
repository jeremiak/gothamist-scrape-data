<p>Forest Hills Stadium already has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501202618/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/24/forest_hill_stadium_2017_lineup.php">some of the best acts</a> coming to their storied venue this year, and today one more was announced: Interpol will be performing at the stadium on September 23rd. And not just Interpol: <em>2002 Interpol</em>.</p>

<p>The band is celebrating the 15th Anniversary of their debut album <em>Turn On The Bright Lights</em> by playing the record in its entirety at the stadium. They will also do this in L.A. a week later, but the rest of their North American tour dates will be standard Interpol shows.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re in a certain age bracket and were living in NYC in the early aughts, and lived on the Lower East Side, or at least hung out there, or knew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501202618/https://twitter.com/ultragrrrl">Sarah Lewitinn</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501202618/https://twitter.com/karenplusone">Karen Ruttner</a>, or ever went to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501202618/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/rip_dark_room.php">the Dark Room</a>, or dated Carlos D, then this album was most likely your soundtrack for that era. It was the one that came before your other soundtrack from that decade, <em>Antics</em>. Listening to both now will make you very nostalgic for watching <em>The OC</em> in your little LES apartment.</p>
