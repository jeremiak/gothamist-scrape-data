<p>With a lack of public restrooms in the city, certainly we could find some use for these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151006014922/http://www.aandeboom.nl/#1240676/P-Tree">P-Trees</a>. Open your mind, New Yorkers! A Dutch design studio created these mechanisms and debuted them at Denmark&#x2019;s Roskilde Festival, providing a nice open-air alternative to the Porta-Potty. The temporary tree-friendly urinal is attached to trees using straps, making peeing in public <em>slightly</em> more sophisticated. Would these work in the city&apos;s parks, perhaps with a privacy shade?</p>
