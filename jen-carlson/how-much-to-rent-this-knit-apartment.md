										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="OLEKapt0311.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202926im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/OLEKapt0311.jpg" width="640" height="424" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202926/http://gothamist.com/tags/olek">Olek</a>, she who adorned the Wall Street bull in colorful knit, has gone and knit an entire apartment. <em>There is officially nothing left to knit now</em>. Her crocheted knit digs are actually at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202926/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/03/olek-sleeps-inside-her-gallery-exhibit">Christopher Henry Gallery</a> (and will be there through May), and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202926/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/03/olek-sleeps-inside-her-gallery-exhibit">Animal</a> includes a knit dildo, a knit toilet, and just about anything you&apos;d find in a typical New Yorker&apos;s apartment. This is possibly the only extra small apartment a real estate agent could list in this city where the term &quot;cozy&quot; would actually mean cozy!
