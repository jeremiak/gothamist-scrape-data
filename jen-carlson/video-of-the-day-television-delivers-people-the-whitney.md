The will be work from Alex Bag, Dara Birnbaum, Joan Braderman, Keren Cytter, Kalup Linzy, Richard Serra (yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172949/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/03/richard_serra_r.php"><em>that</em> Richard Serra</a>), Michael Smith, and Ryan Trecartin. &quot;The exhibition borrows its title from Richard Serra&apos;s video Television Delivers People (1973), which playfully pairs a Muzak soundtrack with a scrolling list of statements describing the manipulative strategies and motivations imbedded in television by corporate advertisers.&quot; You can watch that video below, and there is more on Serra&apos;s video art work, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172949/http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$artistdetail?SERRAR">here</a>:</p>
