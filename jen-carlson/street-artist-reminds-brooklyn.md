<p>A street artist has put up signs all over Brooklyn (have you spotted them elsewhere?) reminding passerby of a few things. We were confronted by this &quot;Life Is Too Short&quot; sign in DUMBO this morning, but it&apos;s the &quot;You Are Not Cool&quot; reminder that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153917/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?p=31096">Miss Heather</a> spotted in Williamsburg that&apos;s really perfectly placed. The signs, which mimic official NYC street signs, are the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153917/http://www.flickr.com/groups/trustocorp/pool/">TrustoCorp</a>.</p>
