This morning in New Jersey (Monmouth Beach, to be exact), a 20 to 30-foot long humpback whale was discovered. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324174017/http://www.wcbs880.com/Washed-Up-Whale-Moves-North/4888860">WCBS reports</a> that &quot;...the stomach was distended. The smell was not terrific, as you could well imagine.&quot; Allegedly the heat had destroyed the whale&apos;s insides, so scientists were unable to take samples from it. However, because of bruising they believe it may have suffered injuries after being hit by a boat. Later today it will be cut into pieces for burial somewhere on the beach, until then beachgoers are advised to stay at least 100 yards away. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324174017/http://www.wcbs880.com/pages/4888814.php?imageGalleryXRefId=1256317">More depressing images here</a>.</p>
