She had been battling breast cancer for quite some time. The author, born in the Bronx on December 11th, 1922, still kept an apartment in Manhattan -- but was at her home in Vermont at the time of death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105128/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/24/books/24paley.html?ref=nyregion">The NY Times</a> recaps her life in literature:</p><blockquote>Ms. Paley&#x2019;s output was modest, about four-dozen stories in three volumes: &#x201C;The Little Disturbances of Man&#x201D; (Doubleday, 1959); &#x201C;Enormous Changes at the Last Minute&#x201D; (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1974); and &#x201C;Later the Same Day&#x201D; (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1985). But she attracted a devoted following and was widely praised by critics for her pitch-perfect dialogue, which managed at once to be surgically spare and almost unimaginably rich.<p></p>

<p>Her &#x201C;Collected Stories,&#x201D; published by Farrar, Straus in 1994, was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. (The collection was reissued by Farrar, Straus this year.) </p></blockquote>Paley (pictured with the megaphone) was a pioneer in exploring and writing about female lives, often focusing on Jewish and New York women. In a 1978 interview with The Times she told them, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not writing a history of famous people. I am interested in a history of everyday life.&#x201D; When not using the written word, she would bring her beliefs to the street. Describing herself as a &#x201C;somewhat combative pacifist and cooperative anarchist,&#x201D; she spent decades on lower Sixth Avenue, near her Greenwich Village home handing out leaflets for causes she believed in.<p></p>

<p>In 1998 she ended an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105128/http://www.salon.com/books/int/1998/10/26int.html">Salon</a> saying, &quot;But if your health is good, and you have a habit of looking at each day as a whole day -- unless you drop dead at noon or something -- then every day you live something interesting. It&apos;s interesting because you either meet a new tree or if you&apos;re in the city, you meet a new person. Or something happens. The sun shifts on the mountain -- very beautiful things happen.&quot;</p>
