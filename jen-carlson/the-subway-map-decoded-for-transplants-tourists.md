<p>One kind New Yorker, Milo Beckman, has created a visual breakdown of the New York City (well, Manhattan) subway system, to make it easier for confused neophytes to understand. On his website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809224036/http://milobeckman.com/2016/02/09/manhattan-subways-an-explainer-for-transplants/">Beckman explains</a>, &quot;The subway map looks like a confusing mess, but it&#x2019;s actually pretty simple. Even the most fresh-faced transplant can make sense of it, if you just break it down into what you really need to know.&quot; </p>

<p>A valiant effort! Though we predict that around around step #3 most tourists will order an Uber or <em>one of those adorable little pedicabs, honey.</em></p>
