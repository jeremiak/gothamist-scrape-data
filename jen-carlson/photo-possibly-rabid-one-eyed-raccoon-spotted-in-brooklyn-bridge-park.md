Witness to the scene, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211008/https://twitter.com/bobbyfinger">Bobby Finger</a>, told us the raccoon &quot;was moving slowly up the back of the fence. He had just one eye, and the other was reduced to a horrifying bloody facial cavity. After hopping over the fence to our side, he climbed down slowly, then landed on the ground, where the park ranger people attempted to catch him.&quot; Lindsay Robertson, who once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211008/http://www.theawl.com/2010/07/down-the-rabbit-hole-a-guide-to-rabies-videos">curated a series of videos</a> showing animals with rabies, was also on the scene, and declared the raccoon to be rabid.<p></p>

<p>The fellow trepidatious picnickers left once help was at the scene, frightened the raccoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211008/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/07/raccoon_bites_woman_in_central_park.php">would attack</a>. They believe he was caught, but we have been unable to confirm that yet. So be warned, anyone going to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422211008/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/30/bk_movies.php"><em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em></a> in the park tonight.</p>

<p>If you see a rabid raccoon, call 311, and if one attacks you or your pet, call 911 and/or the Animal Bite Unit. And as always, Tweet your experience once you&apos;re in a safe zone:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Brooklyn Bridge Park folks confirm, &quot;There was a raccoon in the park last night but it has since been captured without incident by Parks Enforcement Patrol and NYPD.&quot; We are still awaiting to hear if it was rabid, and what happened to it.</p>
