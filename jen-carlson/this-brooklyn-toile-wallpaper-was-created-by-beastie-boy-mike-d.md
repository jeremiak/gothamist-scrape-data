<p>A younger, rowdier Mike Diamond of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034845/http://gothamist.com/tags/beastieboys">Beastie Boys</a> probably never aspired to design a nice toile wallpaper, but here we are. Mike D has teamed up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034845/http://revolvernewyork.com/portfolio/brooklyn-toile/">with Revolver</a>, who says he &quot;decided he wanted a Brooklyn inspired toile wallpaper that would line the walls of his Brooklyn brownstone. The vision was to pay tribute to all things Brooklyn in a way that would appear to be a traditional French Country Toile, but when you step to it the pattern reveals elements and vignettes that make up the truth about Brooklyn.&quot;</p>

<p>The wallpaper features Notorious B.I.G., Coney Island, Hasidic Jews, the elevated subway, the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn Borough Hall, Nathan&apos;s hot dogs... what else can you spot?</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="phpHP9dNDPM.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034845im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/phpHP9dNDPM.jpeg" width="640" height="337" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The design comes in both blue and red, and... we want both. To cover a 12&apos; wide x 10&apos; high wall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034845/http://www.flavorpaper.com/wallpaper/detail/152/Brooklyn-Toile">it&apos;ll cost you</a> around $1,000. But the beauty of Toile is that even a small well-placed square can be enough, and 5-square-feet will cost just around $40.</p>
