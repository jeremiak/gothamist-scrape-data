Enter: the Guggenheim and their friends at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152637/http://improveverywhere.com/2011/05/31/the-mute-button/">Improv Everywhere</a>. The two joined forces to create a mute button for the museum&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152637/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/25/guggenheim_installation_coming_to_t.php">stillspotting nyc</a> exhibition. The mission included 23 actors, 2 dogs, and one noisy public park. The troupe took over the northern entrance of Prospect Park, and confused a crowd with scenes of synchronized silence.</p>

<p>But why stop there&#x2014;we need to make this <em>a real thing</em>. Who wouldn&apos;t love to mute that annoying lady on her cell phone, or that yapping dog, or that loud upstairs neighbor, or that guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152637/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/video_10.php">Bloody Loco</a>?</p>

<p>We believe in this idea, and whoever can take this thing to the next level: we&apos;ve made this logo for you. And now, your inspiration from the Guggenheim and Improv Everywhere:</p>
