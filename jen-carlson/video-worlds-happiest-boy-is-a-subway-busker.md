title: Video: "World's Happiest Boy" is a Subway Busker
---

<p>Need a feel-good moment for your Friday? How about this video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160642/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/meet-jason-cordero-worlds-happiest-boy.html">NYC the Blog</a>, showing the self-proclaimed &quot;World&apos;s Happiest Boy&quot; playing piano in the subway system. The blog notes that Jason Cordero, a Queens resident, can usually be found in Herald or Times Square (he&apos;s also been spotted with a grand piano, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160642/http://lindadolano.blogspot.com/2010/06/happiness-is-grand-piano.html">above ground</a>.) And yes, his father keeps watch nearby.</p>

<p>Cordero is 12-years-old... which makes us wonder, who&apos;s the city&apos;s youngest busker?</p>
