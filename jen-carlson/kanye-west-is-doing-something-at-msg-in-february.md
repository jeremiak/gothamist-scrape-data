<p>In just two weeks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044325/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a>&apos;s latest album <em>SWISH</em> will finally be here&#x2014;and it looks like he&apos;s going to introduce it at Madison Square Garden on February 11th. </p>

<p>Fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044325/https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/42ry3h/kanye_wests_swish_will_be_premiered_during_yeezy/">noticed</a> movie theaters across the U.S. selling tickets to a world premiere of <em>SWISH</em>, &quot;live from Madison Square Garden,&quot; and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044325/http://www.ticketmaster.com/kanye-west-season-3-new-york-new-york-02-11-2016/event/3B0050390BB7229F?artistid=885590">a Ticketmaster page</a> has been set up for the big event. But things are still a little mysterious...</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044325/http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/kanye-may-debut-swish-at-madison-square-garden.html">Consequence of Sound</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s unclear whether Kanye will actually be performing at MSG or simply streaming the album. It&#x2019;s worth noting that Kanye is also expected to debut season three of his adidas fashion line on February 11th, so it&#x2019;s conceivable <em>SWISH</em> will be soundtracking a fashion show. An event listing on Cineworld Cinema&#x2019;s website notes that the screening will feature a performance by Kanye&#x2019;s visual art collaborator Vanessa Beecroft.&quot;</p>

<p>The art circulating for the event has the words: &quot;Yeezy Season 3,&quot; falling in line with the names of his first two fashion shows. The 11th is the first day of New York Fashion Week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044325/http://pitchfork.com/news/63155-kanye-west-to-premiere-swish-with-live-event-screened-in-theaters/">Pitchfork</a> notes that &quot;West streamed both previous Yeezy Season launches in theaters.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is releasing an album so complicated these days?</p>

<p>Whatever is happening at MSG on the 11th, you can try to pick up some tickets starting January 29th at 10 a.m. (or tomorrow if you have an AMEX card). You may be the first to hear &quot;the best album of all time.&quot;</p>
