title: Video: NASA Sets Up Telescope In Battery Park
---

<p>While the city awaits a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060732/http://gothamist.com/tags/spaceshuttle">space shuttle</a>, NASA has brought in a full-scale model of their James Webb Space Telescope as part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060732/http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/">2010 World Science Festival</a>. This will be the world&apos;s most powerful spacescope, and its replica is currently on display at Battery Park. Columbia University physicist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060732/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/12/brian_greene_physicist_world_scienc.php">Brian Greene</a> explains its power, saying, &quot;We may be able to finally get an understanding of how galaxies form, how planets form, how stars form, in detail. Maybe we&apos;ll figure out the dark energy that we&apos;ve learned is the fusion of the cosmos forcing space to expand.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060732/http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/01/james-webb-space-telescope-new-york/">FOX</a>, the model is constructed mainly of aluminum and steel, is about the size of a tennis court, and weighs 12,000 pounds. Here&apos;s a look at it getting built over a period of 5 days:</p>

<p>The real telescope won&apos;t be ready until 2014, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060732/http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/the-james-webb-space-telescope">here&apos;s what you&apos;ll get to experience</a> if you visit the Battery Park site.</p>
