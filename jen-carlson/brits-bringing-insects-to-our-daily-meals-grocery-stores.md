<p>While some humans do seem to enjoy the shock value of dining on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516072854/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/19/explorers_club.php#photo-9">kangaroos, muskrats and eyeballs</a>, can everyone get on board with frequent meals made from insects?</p>

<p>One British company has now presented their plan (in the video below) to get bugs into our bellies, noting insects are high in protein, and low in fat and cholesterol. But this isn&apos;t just a personal thing&#x2014;eating them would also be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516072854/http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679283/ento-box-the-elegant-insect-meal-of-the-future#1">good for the planet</a>, which is being damaged by digestive gas and feed production from the unsustainable herds of cattle that are at the center of the Western diet. Plus, what else are we going to do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516072854/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/cicada-cooking-pizza-tacos-jello-article-1.1314334?localLinksEnabled=false">with these billions of cicadas</a>?</p>

<p>Ento aims to wean us off of our current eating habits, and coax us into eating insects with its Ento Box. The Ento Box will features cubes created with insects and other ingredients, which are presented in an abstract way that do a good job of covering up the fact you are eating insects. But that&apos;s just the beginning&#x2014;by 2018 they hope to have rolled-out restaurants, microwavable meals, and insect-based cooking products. By that time, they also hope to introduce insects (in their natural form) to the meat aisle of grocery stores.</p>
