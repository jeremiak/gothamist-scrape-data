Recently we asked the man behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075257/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/29/love_letters.php">love letters</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075257/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/16/funometer.php">fun-o-meter</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075257/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/19/forcing_missed.php">Wookie suit</a> about his latest project: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075257/http://zoomdoggle.com/2008/12/zoomdoggle-cures-boredom-and-for-all-by-text/">Fun Idea Text</a>. He also told us a little bit about just what it is he does, and why he does it.</em></p>

<p><strong>You seem to have your hands in a lot of honey jars, what is it that you do exactly?</strong> I do a few things: 1. I run a little marketing firm, GiantMINIATURE, developing and executing alternative marketing strategy. I&apos;ll spare you the details on that, but I connect the products they&apos;ve got, with the headlines they want, without spending a ton. Last year, I took one company from 10 google hits to 10,000 in just over a week and got them on Regis &amp; Kelly, mentioned on SNL and featured on ABC Nightline News to boot.</p>

<p>2. With everyone&apos;s budgets shrinking, it&apos;s more important than ever to foster happy, productive, fun work environments. I help facilitate that from time to time.</p>

<p>3. I keep a blog about fun called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075257/http://zoomdoggle.com/">Zoomdoggle</a>. It doesn&apos;t make a dime. It&apos;s just a good time, but it seems to inadvertently power the other 2 endeavors. Plus, it&apos;s all stuff I&apos;d be looking at, thinking about, and doing anyway.</p>

<p><strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong> Handsome. When that failed, I started thinking rich would be cool. Seeing as I&apos;ll probably never get there either, I&apos;m just focusing on happy these days. <br>
 <br>
<strong>Tell us a little bit about Zoomdoggle&apos;s Fun Text idea.</strong> I made a &quot;fun idea machine&quot; a few months back and people seemed to really like it, so I decided to take the idea mobile. Put the number 30644 in your phone under the name Zoomdoggle. Any time you&apos;re bored, text it &quot;NEED FUN&quot;, and it&apos;ll send you back a random, fun idea. For free! It&apos;s just that easy. Give it a go. Have a smile. And remember, it&apos;s there for you any time you need it. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075257/http://zoomdoggle.com/2008/12/zoomdoggle-cures-boredom-and-for-all-by-text/">Did someone say video?</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Are the ideas city-centric?</strong> Location specific is the goal. We just got that functionality on the phone system over the weekend. Text it from a 917, 347, or 212 number, and there&apos;s a chance you might get something you can only do in NYC. It might take a few shots though, there&apos;s almost 300 ideas in there and at the moment only 25 are NYC specific.</p>
