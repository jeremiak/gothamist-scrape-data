With Manhattanites trying to pawn SI off on Jersey, and Jerseyites rejecting it, it was only a matter of time before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301055757/http://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2008/05/rock_the_harbor_sparks_staten.html">Staten Island Advance</a> caught wind of the fightin&apos; words, noting that &quot;battle lines were drawn.&quot; One of the promoters of the show also chimed in, saying, in part:</p><blockquote>We actually have a lot more to offer on Staten Island aside from what you may have seen on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301055757/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/04/no_mtv_footage.php">True Life: I&apos;m a Staten Island Girl</a>. Not all of us say &apos;Bro&apos;, not all of us are mobbed up, and not all of us have no idea about the arts or culture. We actually have quite a few beautiful attractions, but I&apos;ll save the tourism chat for another time. The whole point of Rock the Harbor was to shine a light on a music scene that is slowly gaining some steam. There&apos;s all sorts of bands on this lineup from straight up indie, to shoegaze, to punk, to pop, to bluegrass, we have a bit of everything and are planning on hosting this event with a completely open mind.</blockquote>And is the commute <em>really</em> much worse than getting out to the Siren Fest on Coney Island, which swarms with hipsters every year?<p></p>
