<p>You know that iconic photograph (later recreated as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161355/http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinyca/6837176066/">sculpture</a>) of construction workers eating lunch on a narrow beam jutting from a skyscraper? Turns out it was a publicity stunt. Today is the 80th anniversary of when the shot was taken, and according to Ken Johnston, chief historian and archivist for Corbis Images (who own the image): &quot;The image was a publicity effort by Rockefeller Center. It seems pretty clear they were real workers, but the event was organized with a number of photographers.&quot; You can actually find the photo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161355/http://www.flickr.com/photos/christinyca/6157464048/">at the Top of the Rock</a>.</p>

<p>The shot was taken on the construction site of the RCA site, later named the GE building, which is part of Rockefeller Center. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006161355/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-casual-lunchtime-snap-or-the-worlds-most-iconic-publicity-stunt-8157380.html">The Independent</a> notes that it&apos;s unclear who the photographer of this exact image was (though it&apos;s often credited to Charles Ebbets) because there were so many there sent by news agencies. </p>

<p>It&apos;s also not known who the workers in the photo were&#x2014;Corbis even &quot;hired private investigators and enlisted a New York newspaper to help find out who they were,&quot; but in the end determined it was impossible to track down their names.</p>
