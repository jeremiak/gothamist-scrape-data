										<p><img alt="0805apolla.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140903024227im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0805apolla.jpg" width="300" height="400" class="right">Orchard Street designer Doron Braunshtein (aka Apollo Braun, pictured) is at it again; in March he launched his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140903024227/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/21/who_killed_obam.php">&quot;Who Killed Obama?&quot; t-shirt</a> and now he&apos;s added a new political statement to his line: the $250 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140903024227/http://apollobraun.com/store/store.cfm?prodnum=553">&quot;Jews Against Obama&quot; t-shirt</a>. </p>

<p>And that&apos;s not the only provocation: Braunshtein also started what he calls a &quot;political movement&quot; as a cute, must-have accessory to the T. His recruitment efforts have gone through his mailing list, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140903024227/http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8520738084&amp;ref=share">Facebook</a> and Myspace.</p>

<p>As with his last design, he explains that he&apos;s &quot;selling an idea&quot; that will one day hang &quot;in the greatest museums and galleries in the city.&quot; He also wants you all to know how he <em>really</em> feels about Obama, in case it wasn&apos;t clear:</p><blockquote>&quot;I am a true anti-Obama New York Jew. The word on the street is that New York Jews will vote for McCain anyhow. <strong>The majority of the Jews  &#x2013;  at least the ones that are proud of their religion and practice it  &#x2013;  like me, don&apos;t want to see Obama &#x2013; a man who&apos;s middle name is Hussein, and his family from his Kenyan father&apos;s side is Muslim, as the leader of this great country.</strong> <p></p>

<p>More than that, after Obama&apos;s pastor, Jeremiah Wright honored Louis Farrakhan &#x2013; definitely one of the most racist and anti-Semitic people alive  &#x2013; Obama lost us Jews totally. That made me start this political movement in the first place.&quot;</p></blockquote>In March, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140903024227/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03032008/news/columnists/barack_lash__by_jews__dov_100265.htm">the NY Post</a> quoted Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind&apos;s prediction that Jewish voters would be making &quot;a mass movement toward Sen. McCain&quot; should Clinton lose the nomination.<p></p>
