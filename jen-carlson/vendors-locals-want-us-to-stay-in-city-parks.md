title: Vendors: Locals Want Us To Stay In City Parks
---

	
										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105636/http://www.streetvendor.org/">Street Vendor Project</a> at the Urban Justice Center surveyed folks in Union Square and Central Park on Monday, and they report back that 94 of 100 wanted artists to stay. Artists are, of course, staying&#x2014;but under the new proposed regulations they would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105636/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/18/vendors_1.php">cut down significantly</a> in certain city parks. They compiled this video, where locals praise the art community in city parks, and wonder how anyone could possibly find it difficult to navigate around the vendors that are set up there.</p>

<p>The proposal is set to be discussed at a hearing this Friday morning at Chelsea Recreation Center (430 West 25th Street) where at least 500 NYC street artists plan to protest outside starting at 10 a.m.</p>
