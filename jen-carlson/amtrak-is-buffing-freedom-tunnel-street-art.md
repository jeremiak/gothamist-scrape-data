</div></div><p>The Freedom Tunnel&#x2014;the Amtrak Tunnel that has long been a destination for both street artists and urban explorers&#x2014;is in danger of being buffed! This is according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130302005558/http://www.adventuretwo.net/stories/freedom-no-more">Adventure Two</a>&#x2014;the blogger of that site writes he talked to a woman who has lived in the tunnel for 20 years about changes to the tunnel security, and work being undertaken by Amtrak, noting &quot;there was a rumour that large blocks of the tunnel walls had been washed over with paint, destroying significant sections of the historical artwork.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, upon a journey through the tunnel, he was met by a &quot;plain flat grey&quot; stretch of wall, where there used to be graffiti. He writes, &quot;for a short distance the wall reverted back to it&apos;s densely tagged state, but then the grey was back for as far as could be seen.&quot;</p>

<p>To check out what the Freedom Tunnel used to look like before being buffed over in a dead shade of grey, Nate Kensinger&apos;s documentary about it (called &quot;Covered Tracks&quot;) will be screening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130302005558/http://www.rooftopfilms.com/2010/schedule/70-trapped-in-the-tunnel">on December 11th</a> <em>inside the Atlantic Tunnel</em>, which is almost as good as it screening inside the Freedom Tunnel itself&#x2014;solid grey probably makes for a pretty good screen to project upon.</p>
