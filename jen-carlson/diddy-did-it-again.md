Oh yes he Diddy! The rap mogul was at the after-hours club Kiosk (located at 95 Spring Street) when the rumble went down, and he&apos;s yet to turn himself in. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163659/http://www.amny.com/entertainment/ny-nydidd165414508oct16,0,3635599.story">amNewYork</a> reports that &quot;he was expected to appear at the First Precinct this morning for questioning.&quot;</p><blockquote>Police would not identify the victim in the case but they said First Precinct officers responded to a 3:15 a.m. call for a fight at the club. They found a man, who was identified as Steven Acevedo, suffering from at least two wounds to his face, the result of two punches Combs allegedly landed.</blockquote>Apparently the fight was over the woman who hung off Diddy&apos;s arm at Cannes this summer, also the former girlfriend of Acevedo - who claims at one point during the fight Sunday Diddy said he would kill him as his bodyguard showed he had a gun to do just that. <p></p>

<p>Being a complete stranger to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163659/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/24/video_of_the_da_67.php">&quot;no snitching rule&quot;</a> Acevedo fled the scene and called the cops from the safety of his own home. They are currently talking to witnesses and &quot;Combs will be charged with a misdemeanor - third-degree assault - and given a desk-appearance ticket for his role in the incident,&quot; though he won&apos;t face any jail time. His bodyguard, however, may not be so lucky with a possible gun charge against him.</p>

<p>Combs is no stranger to love woes and violent incidents, and The Post has a pretty good wrap-up of his rap sheet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163659/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10162007/news/regionalnews/charges_looming_vs__diddy.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  Diddy&apos;s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163659/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20152648,00.html">said</a>, &quot;We are hopeful that this matter will be resolved without the filing of any criminal charges, as this was a disagreement among acquaintances, not a criminal assault...What is being reported in the media is inaccurate.  Mr. Combs is not going to be arrested today.&quot;  <br>
