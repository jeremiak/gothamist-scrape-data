</div></div>					<p>As we know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151948/http://gothamist.com/tags/billmurray">Bill Murray</a> has been in town filming <em>St. Vincent de Van Nuys</em>, and approximately 4 out of 5 New Yorkers (probably? It <em>feels</em> like that many) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151948/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/have_you_run_into_bill_murray_yet.php">have spotted him</a>. If you believe in statistical principles <em>and why wouldn&apos;t you</em>, then the law of averages says you have a pretty good chance of getting your very own Bill Murray Experience during this lifetime. An even better chance if you frequently hang out in Williamsburg at places where they serve wine and good food. And an even better chance if you don&apos;t seek him out. Let Bill Murray happen <em>to</em> you. Don&apos;t force it... even if that works because you stalk him on set, a perfect Bill Murray Experience needs to be serendipitous.</p>

And please, if you See Bill Murray, Say Something. Tweet, Vine, and Instagram it. The rest of us need this for hope.<br>

<p>Even if you don&apos;t see him, say something. This is just the worst kind of Bill Murray Experience... the <em>Almost</em> Bill Murray Experience. It hurts.<br>

<p>Maybe set it up near PS 150 in Queens, where Murray is filming (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428151948/http://sunnysidepost.com/2013/08/04/bill-murray-visits-sunnyside/">likely in plaid shorts</a>) again today.</p>
