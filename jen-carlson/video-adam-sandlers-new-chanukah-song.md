<p>For the fourth time since its <em>Saturday Night Live</em> debut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115748/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNisJddhIkA">in 1994</a>, Adam Sandler has rewritten his &quot;Chanukah Song.&quot; The latest rendition was performed live at Judd Apatow&apos;s show at Carnegie Hall over the weekend, and features mentions of Shia LaBeouf, Jared from Subway, and Adam Levine. </p>

<p>For comparison, and to really feel old, the original included David Lee Roth, Goldie Hawn, O.J. Simpson, and Spock; the 1999 revision had Winona Ryder, Mike D, and Courtney Love; the 2002 version included Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, and Natalie Portman. Here&apos;s the latest:</p>

<blockquote>Put on your yarmulke, here comes Chanukah
It&#x2019;s so much fun-akkah to celebrate Chanukah

<p>Chanukkah is the Festival of Lights,<br>
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights.</p>

<p>When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree,<br>
Here&#x2019;s the fourth list of people who are Jewish, just like Jesus, Olaf, Punky Brewster, Judd Apatow, Scott Rudin, and me!</p>

<p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt enjoys eating kugel<br>
So does Stan Lee, Jake Gylleenhaal, and the two guys who founded Google<br>
Adam Levine wears a Jewish star<br>
So does Drake and Seth Rogen<br>
Goldberg has a gold yarmulke to match the belt he wore from Hulk Hogan</p>

<p>We got Scarlett Johansson, talk about a cultured crush<br>
And if you need a hotter voice to turn you on, how about getting it from Lost?<br>
We may not have a cartoon of a reindeer that can talk<br>
But we also don&#x2019;t have polio, thanks to Dr. Jonas Salk</p>

<p>Put on your yarmulke, it&#x2019;s time for Chanukah<br>
Harry Potter and his magic wandi-kah, celebrate Chanukah</p>

<p>Jared from Subway: Fuck, a Jew<br>
But guess who&#x2019;s Jewish and can fix him? Loveline&#x2019;s Dr. Drew<br>
Princess Leia cuts the halva with Elsa from Frozen<br>
David Beckham is the king of soccer studs and also a quarter chosen<br>
Ron Jeremy is fully Jewish and so is his foot-long buddy<br>
Shia LaBeouf is half a Jew but 100 percent nutty<br>
It&#x2019;s who but Santa Claus who makes Christmas so merry<br>
But we get two jolly fat guys: ice cream&#x2019;s Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s</p>

<p>Come on all to Chanukah, get up and celebrate Chanukah<br>
Don&#x2019;t mess with us, oh Chanukah, let&#x2019;s all get along for Chanukah<br>
So drink your Jaegerbomb-ikkah and smoke your medical-marijuan-ikkah<br>
If you really, really wanna-kah, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah</p></blockquote><p></p>
