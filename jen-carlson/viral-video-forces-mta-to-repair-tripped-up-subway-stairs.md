<p>Yesterday morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508184319/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/video_subway_stairs.php">we posted a video</a> showing people falling up subway stairs (getting tripped up on one step that was slightly higher than the rest). The video, filmed by Dean Peterson during the short timeframe of about an hour, was mostly comical, as no one got hurt, but as it spread around the internet the word &quot;lawsuit&quot; was getting bantered about in comments sections. So it&apos;s unsurprising that the 36th Street station&apos;s steps were found taped off late yesterday, as the problem was fixed&#x2014;a tipster sent us the above photo from the scene. </p>

<p>The MTA&apos;s Kevin Ortiz told us this morning, &quot;Crews were dispatched yesterday to make any necessary repairs.&quot;</p>
