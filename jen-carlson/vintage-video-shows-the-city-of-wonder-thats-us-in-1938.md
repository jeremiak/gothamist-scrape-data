										<p>Below, enjoy nearly ten minutes of pre-World War II footage of New York City. In it, you&apos;ll hear the Bowery being dubbed &quot;dingy,&quot; along with a nod to the Lower East Side and its changing landscape (&quot;its smaller tenements rapidly being replaced with wider streets and better housing&quot;). Here are some other descriptions, delivered by that classic old school narrator voice:</p>

<ul><li>Downtown: &quot;it&apos;s all work and no play here. Busy by day, but deserted by night.&quot;
</li><li>Wall Street: &quot;the financial post of America&quot;
</li><li>Park Avenue: &quot;street of wealth and social prestige&quot;
</li><li>The public library: &quot;its friendly pigeons never want for food&quot;
</li><li>Columbia University: &quot;the city&apos;s leading seat of learning&quot;
</li><li>Harlem: &quot;where they teach the world how to sing and how to dance&quot;</li></ul>

Castle of Castle Films, a company that specialized in watch-at-home movies in the era before VHS.&quot;</p>
