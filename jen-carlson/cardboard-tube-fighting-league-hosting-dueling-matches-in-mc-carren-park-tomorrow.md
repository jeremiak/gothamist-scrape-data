										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cardboard0712.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612162846im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cardboard0712.jpeg" width="300" height="358" class="image-right"> </span>Have the Olympics whet your appetite for competition? Is your definition of &quot;sports&quot; a lot looser than the next person&apos;s? Well then, step right up, for tomorrow afternoon the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612162846/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardboard_Tube_Fighting_League">Cardboard Tube Fighting League</a> is hosting a tournament. </p>

<p>This event hasn&apos;t happened <a href="gothamist.com/2009/07/13/cardboard_tube_war_ravages_mccarren.php#photo-1">since 2009</a>, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612162846/http://nonsensenyc.com/">Nonsense NY</a> says it&apos;s been <em>four</em> years since the last battle (putting it on the old Olympics schedule)... they also say it&apos;s happening in August <em>and</em> that it&apos;s tomorrow (and last week they said it was last week). This is turning into that time we tried to go to a rave. How does this work?! </p>

<p>From what we can tell, if you show up at McCarren Park tomorrow between 12:30 and 2 p.m., you&apos;ll get a cardboard tube (you aren&apos;t allowed to bring outside tubes) which you can then hit people with. They also encourage you to wear cardboard breastplates, gauntlets, helmets, and cod-pieces for the &quot;head-to-head duels and full melee battles.&quot; Obviously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612162846/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/20/13-year-old_girl_describes_mccarren.php">this should go smoothly</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612162846/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/18/chaotic_scene_outside_mccarren_park.php">without incident</a>.</p>
