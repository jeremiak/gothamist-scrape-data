<p>Time to turn into the skid and just go with this whole snow thing. What we mean is: it&apos;s time to go sledding. During the Blizzard of 2010, we listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/26/tomorrow_snow_day_sledding_hot_choc.php">a few spots</a>, and there are some more below courtesy of someone who knows best: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/http://www.achildgrows.com/2011/01/27/the-best-places-to-sled-in-brooklyn-and-nyc/">a mom</a>. Send us your own favorite sledding spots and we&apos;ll add them to the list (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">photos also welcome</a>!).</p>

</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/http://www.squid-knits.blogspot.com/">Squid Knits</a> sends us this tip: &quot;Don&apos;t forget Ceder Hill in Central Park at 79th and 5th.  Fast sledding for the older kids going from west to east and gentler slopes for the little ones going from east to west.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>BROOKLYN</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>Fort Greene Park (a steep, less crowded area can be found at &quot;the back part of the hill that leads down to Myrtle Ave&#x2014;you will find less crowds, and a much steeper ride. You might even find some snowboarders there.&quot;)<br>
</li><li>The Nethermead&#x2014;Picnic House area in Prospect Park (warning: gets crowded!)<br>
</li><li>The Long Meadow Slope&#x2014;Tennis House Area in Prospect Park<br>
</li><li>Vanderbilt Playground (right off of Prospect Park Southwest)<br>
</li><li>Maryland Monument (&quot;enter at Prospect Park Southwest and 16th Street and proceed across to Wellhouse Drive. The slope is by the bridge and is pretty steep.&quot;)<br>
</li><li>Sunset Park (enter at 41st/44th Street and 5th Avenue)&#x2014;not crowded, not steep!<br>
</li><li>Owl&#x2019;s Head Park in Bay Ridge (at Shore Parkway, Shore Road, Colonial Road and 68 Street)<br>
</li><li>Shore Road and 97th (&quot;a big hill!)<br>
</li><li>Brooklyn Heights: the dog park by Harry Chapin Playground has a hill<br>
</li><li>Clumber Corner in DUMBO near the BQE and Washington Street (check it out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/http://dumbonyc.com/2011/01/12/no-snow-day-in-dumbo/">here</a>)</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>QUEENS</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>Forest Park: according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/http://mommypoppins.com/ny-kids/best-sledding-hills-in-new-york-city">Mommy Poppins</a>, &quot;the popular spot is the golf course where, technically, sledding is not allowed because it&apos;s deemed unsafe by the parks department. There&apos;s also a hill in Forest Park at the Mary Whale Playground at 79th St and Park Lane.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Juniper Valley Park at 75th Street and Lower Highland Park</li></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>THE BRONX</strong><br>
</p><ul><li>Ewen Park&#x2014;one of the best sledding spots in the city (bonus: stairs for climbing back up the hill)<br>
</li><li>Van Cortland Park<br>
</li><li>Crotona Park at Fulton Ave around 174th Street</li></ul><p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/http://www.achildgrows.com/">aforementioned mom</a> also has tips for the sledless: just get a metal garbage can lid and turn it over, or an old tire, a cookie sheet, or cardboard box! Easy enough... though don&apos;t forget to grease it all up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205040714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rMcRJVY1-0">Clark Griswold style</a> for maximum speed.</p>
