<p>The rumors of Beyonc&#xE9; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118134726/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/31/did_beyonce_have_a_baby_shell_be_ma.php">having her baby</a> have been greatly exaggerated, it seems. The very pregnant (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118134726/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/beyonce_responds_to_stupid_fake_bab.php">if you&apos;re a believer</a>) star, and her husband Jay-Z, spent New Year&apos;s Eve in Brooklyn, dining at Buttermilk Channel. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118134726/http://twitter.com/#!/foodrepublic/status/153330116469080064">Food Republic</a> and the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118134726/http://twitter.com/#!/buttermilkbklyn/status/153362215565660160">Tweeted</a> last night just before 11:30 p.m., &quot;Well, if you must know... Jay-Z and Beyonce celebrating NYE at Buttermilk Channel right now.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118134726/http://www.foodrepublic.com/2012/01/01/jay-z-beyonc%C3%A9-do-new-years-brooklyn">Matt Rodbard</a>, the two revisited the restaurant last night. He writes, &quot;on our way out the door from celebrating New Year&#x2019;s at one of our favorite Brooklyn restaurants, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118134726/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/24/buttermilk_channel_set_to_open_tomo.php">Buttermilk Channel</a>, we heard whispers that the couple was on their way. And sure enough, we soon could confirm that Jay, B and unborn child were seated in a cozy table in the back.&quot;</p>

<p>On the menu last night? Chef Ryan Angulo offered a 3-course tasting menu that included &quot;a rich foie gras terrine with pickled grapes, butter-poached lobster from the Red Hook Lobster Pound,&quot; and duck meatloaf with &quot;seared foie gras and a bittersweet chocolate and duck jus.&quot; To our knowledge, none of those induce labor.</p>
