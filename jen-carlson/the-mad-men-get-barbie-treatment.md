<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150222/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> comes back on the air in July, you&apos;ll be able to buy your own Barbie versions of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150222/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinahendricks">Joan Holloway</a>, Don Draper, Betty Draper and Roger Sterling (somehow Peggy got left out of the plastic party&#x2014;though you can see her in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150222/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mawphoto/4421792545/in/set-72157623232424794/">this alt version</a>).</p>

<p>Mattel is marketing the dolls for adults through their Barbie Fashion Model Collection. While they certainly have an adult pricetag of $74.95 each, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150222/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/business/media/10adco.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times</a> they won&apos;t come with grown-up accessories like martinis and cigarettes. But the paper points out that while you may be able to take the cocktail shaker out of Don Draper&apos;s hands, you can&apos;t stop him from bringing his cheating ways into Barbie&apos;s playhouse. As for his wife, one television and pop culture professor noted that Betty is &#x201C;the wife who lives in her dream house whose soul is eaten away.&#x201D; Cheery! Consider her <em>The Bell Jar</em> Barbie that never got made.</p>

<p>There will be around 10,000 dolls made for each of the four characters, to be sold at some specialty shops as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150222/http://amctv.com/">AMCtv.com</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150222/http://barbiecollector.com/">BarbieCollector.com</a>. And might we see Don Draper pitching ad copy for the now iconic doll in the 4th season? Barbie was first introduced to the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150222/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/19/barbie_turns_50.php">on March 9th, 1959</a>&#x2014;so it&apos;s entirely possible.</p>
