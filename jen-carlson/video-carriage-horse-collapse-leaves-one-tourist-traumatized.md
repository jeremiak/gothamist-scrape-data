<p>Tourist Theresa Shaver was taking a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607082240/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">carriage horse</a> ride in Central Park on Sunday afternoon when the horse fell to the ground... and she caught it all on video (you&apos;re going to want to turn your volume down!): </p>

<p>Shaver was clearly distraught by the incident, and told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607082240/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/08/04/tourist-recounts-traumatic-experience-riding-central-park-carriage-horse/">CBS</a> that the experience was &quot;traumatic.&quot; Not only that, but after the horse collapsed (twice), the driver put him right back to work... which she also filmed:</p>

<p>Naturally, a spokesman for the Horse and Carriage Drivers Association, Ian McKeever, says Shaver is just &#x201C;crazy&#x201D; and overreacted in the situation. He says the horse was returned to the stable and didn&apos;t work until the next day, claiming in her video the driver was just waiting for Shaver to come collect her purse. He says, &quot;We followed proper protocol, we brought the horse back to the stable&#x2014;made sure the horse was fine.  And the horse was fine.&quot; The ASPCA&apos;s vet says the horse was simply spooked by a pedicab.</p>

<p>The Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages sent out a release saying, &quot;In view of the three recent accidents, [we have] asked the Public Advocate&apos;s and Manhattan Borough President&apos;s office to do an independent investigation of the safety aspect of the carriage horse trade.  We have also asked the Comptroller&apos;s office to do a performance audit of the Department of Transportation, Department of Parks and NYPD&#x2014;to look into the lax oversight of these agencies regarding traffic rules.&quot;</p>
