<p>There&apos;s probably some sort of government cover-up happening with this whole <em>bee thing</em>, but for now let&apos;s just assume that NYPD resident beekeeper Anthony Planakis is telling us the truth (and nothing but). Planakis was on the scene at 55 Wall Street yesterday after 15,000 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170921/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/bees">bees</a> swarmed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170921/http://www.ciprianiresidences.com/">Cipriani Residences</a>&apos;s door; he told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170921/http://www.nypost.com/video/?vxSiteId=0db7b365-a288-4708-857b-8bdb545cbd0f&amp;vxChannel=NY%20Post&amp;vxClipId=1458_952920&amp;vxBitrate=700">the Post</a>, &quot;it&apos;s a natural split... we had a relatively mild winter, so you had a nice spring build-up, overcrowding inside the hive, possibly a failing queen, and they decided to find a new home.&quot; </p>

<p>Who knows where they were (a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170921/http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/Bee">white dome tent</a> equipped with louver vents?) before they decided to find their new home, but now that they&apos;ve been removed from their temporary city dwelling, they&apos;ve been brought to a bee farm in the &apos;burbs.</p>
