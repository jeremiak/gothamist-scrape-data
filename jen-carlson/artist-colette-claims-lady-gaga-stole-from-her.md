<p>For the holiday season, Barney&apos;s harnessed the imagination of Lady Gaga for their seasonal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627223053/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/05/photos_holiday_windows.php">window displays</a>, but now &quot;Victorian Punk&quot; artist and icon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627223053/http://www.collectcolette.com/">Colette</a> is calling her out for stealing (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627223053/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/gaga_7.php">it wouldn&apos;t be the first time</a>?). </p>

<p>A little background: Colette&apos;s &quot;seminal performance art and multi-media installations originated out of New York City&apos;s vibrant art scene in the 1970s and has traveled to museums and galleries all over the world; including the Guggenheim; MOMA; and The Whitney.&quot; </p>

<p>The artist paid a visit to the windows recently, painting her signature below them, and holding her own protest, which was meant to &quot;send a clear message to the Gaga camp that Colette is standing outside the door and must be invited in and given proper respect.&quot;</p>
