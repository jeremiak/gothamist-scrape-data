title: Dreamy Drone Footage Shows Snowy NYC At Sunrise
---

	
										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113444/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/snowy_scenes_brooklyn.php">big snow storm</a> of earlier this week is but a melting memory, and now we just have slush puddles to curse at as we try to navigate the sidewalks of New York. It&apos;s an ugly scene, but a serene one from above. After the storm, Cody Raisig of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170215113444/http://weddingdronenewyork.com/">WeddingDroneNewYork</a> took his drone out for a spin to capture the snowy city from above, where everything looks a little better.</p>
