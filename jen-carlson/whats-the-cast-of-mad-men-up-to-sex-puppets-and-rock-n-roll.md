<p>Now that the cast of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150123/http://gothamist.com/tags/madmen"><em>Mad Men</em></a> have a little bit of time with the show not returning until 2012, how are they wasting away the days? January Jones (who plays Betty Draper) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150123/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20485795,00.html?loc=interstitialskip">got knocked up</a>! No word on who the father is, but her rep says the 33-year-old is expecting her child this fall and will raise it by herself. Earlier this year Jones said, &quot;I don&apos;t like living with other people. I don&apos;t mind being alone. I just don&apos;t really have a lot of time or energy to put into a relationship when nothing&apos;s going to happen.&quot; Hopefully she&apos;ll find time and energy for her baby!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dreamy <strike>Don Draper</strike>Jon Hamm has made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150123/http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/d0112482f5/herman-dune-tell-me-something-i-don-t-know-with-jon-hamm?rel=player">an adorable music video</a> wherein he picks up a hitchhiking blue puppet. Watch it below.</p>
