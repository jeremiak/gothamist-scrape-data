It&apos;s the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506170021/http://www.habanaoutpost.com/green.html">solar powered</a> flea market/restaurant/artist community. </p>

<p>The space also features art installments, one wall by famed subway aerosal artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506170021/http://www.at149st.com/leeq.html">Lee Quinones</a>. With deejays, live music and movie screenings planned as well, this is a pretty big (and pretty awesome) undertaking that Sean Meenan (of Cafe Habana) has taken on. Keep checking with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506170021/http://www.habanaoutpost.com/calendar.html">calender of events</a> to see what&apos;s coming up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you head over there be sure to order a smoothie or margarita. They&apos;re made with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506170021/http://www.bikeblender.com/">bike blender</a>. Yes, a blender powered by a bike. Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506170021/http://www.habanaoutpost.com/green.html">ten other ways</a> the Outpost keeps it Green. None, however, are as cool as that bike blender.

Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506170021/http://www.bignyc.org/">Build It Green</a>, they supply used materials salvaged from previous establishments.</p>

<p>The flea market is opened every weekend from 12 to 8pm (now through October) and the restaurant is opened Thursday &amp; Friday 4pm - 12am, Friday &amp; Saturday 12pm - 12am. Habana Outpost is located at: 755-757 Fulton Street, Brooklyn</p>

<p>While were on the subject, Gothamist loves flea markets - so if you know of any great ones let us know. We&apos;ve been scouring through the one on A and 11th(?) for a while now. </p>
