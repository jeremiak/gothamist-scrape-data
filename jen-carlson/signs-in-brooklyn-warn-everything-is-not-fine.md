<p>Remember when Tesla covered the Five Man Electric Band song &quot;Signs&quot;? Jeff Keith passionately declared, &quot;So I got me a pen and a paper and I made up my own fuckin&apos; sign!&quot; YEAH. Anyway, whenever we see one of these new street art signs that song begins spinning on repeat in our brain. Join us, won&apos;t you:</p>

<p>The latest to trigger that play button: these signs spotted in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which are a bit less interesting than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153707/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/new_etiquette_rules_posted_around_t.php">the etiquette signs</a>, or anything that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153707/http://gothamist.com/tags/trustocorp">TrustCorp</a> puts up. They read: &quot;No Standing Around. Do some good in the world. 24 hours . 7 days;&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t Sleep;&quot; &quot;Speak Up. 24 hours 7 days;&quot; and &quot;Everything Is Not Fine.&quot; Bolted on to a different sign,  and &quot;If Only Donkeys Had Elephant Balls.&quot;</p>
