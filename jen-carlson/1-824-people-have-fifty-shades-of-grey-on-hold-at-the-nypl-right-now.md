										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="50shadesnypl.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215921im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/50shadesnypl.jpg" width="325" height="259" class="image-right"> </span>While some prudish libraries are debating whether or not to stock E.L. James&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215921/http://gothamist.com/tags/fiftyshadesofgrey"><em>Fifty Shades</em> series</a> (ahem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215921/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/books/fifty-shades-of-grey-by-e-l-james-in-demand-at-libraries.html">North Carolina</a>), the New York Public Library is not one of them... and it looks like they need to stock up. There are currently 1,824 people that have the first book on hold.  </p>

<p>There are 436 copies of the first book in the erotica series, <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, and only 9 available throughout the library&apos;s system. <em>Fifty Shades Darker</em>, the 2nd book, has 638 holds (7 of 161 available) and <em>Fifty Shades Freed</em>, the final in the trilogy, has 1,427 holds (11 of 161 available).</p>

<p>So what do New Yorkers checking this book out think? <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> has a 3 out of 5 star review on the site... the same exact rating as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215921/http://nypl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/18039969052_lady_chatterleys_lover"><em>Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover</em></a>, the  1928 D. H. Lawrence book And ladies, that piece of classic erotica is free for the taking at the NYPL, they currently have 144 of their 168 copies available for checking out!</p>
