</div></div>					<p>Happy Day After <em>LOST</em> Day! (<strong>Spoilers ahead</strong>, for those who haven&apos;t seen it yet.) So what did you think of the finale: was it more <em>Cosby Show</em> (which according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ae-0523-tv-finales-20100523,0,1060094,full.story">this article</a> had a series finale &#x201C;no one remembers at all&quot;) or more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/10/sopranos_series.php"><em>Sopranos</em></a> (which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/19/cat_4.php">likely replay back</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/11/the_sopranos.php">in your head</a> on command)? </p>

<p>This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://abcnews.go.com/WN/lost-finale-executive-producers-reveal-thoughts-finale/story?id=10720042">ABC News</a> has a talk with producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof (video after the jump), in which they say they hope they left you crying&#x2014;but offer little else to ease the reeling minds of fans that have tuned in to 121 episodes over the past 6 years. In fact, they are going into radio silence mode and say they won&apos;t be giving any more explanations or answers&#x2014;leaving you to fill in the blanks, as so many other finales have done. Your best shot is to follow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://twitter.com/DamonLindelof">Lindelof on Twitter</a> and hope he drunk divulges in 140 characters some future night.</p>

<p>Cuse did tell Diane Sawyer, however, that they &quot;tried to make an ending to the show that was kind of spiritual.&quot; Did they succeed, or did it feel more like... if you are in love you go to a couples dance in heaven? While the <em>many</em> unanswered questions will assure this show has a long afterlife of its own (and will we see a feature film?), the basics were essentially explained. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-newlost24_0524gd.State.Edition2.1dc8cdc3.html">To sum up</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://jezebel.com/5546138/touched-by-a-desmond-lost-finale-mystifies-critics">here&apos;s</a> a full set of reviews): &quot;Sideways World was, it seems, a sort of afterlife holding room, where you hang out until all the most important people in your life are dead together&quot; [ed. note: what happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fP7QrDR87M">Live Together, Die Alone</a>?!] &quot;and then everyone can move on into that sunny golden light as a happy group.&quot; (Think: Eternal Slowdance of the Spotless Mind.)</p>

<p>If you&apos;re left wanting more, the Vilcek Foundation&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/20/lost_on_the_upper_east_side.php"><em>LOST</em> exhibit</a> is still running through June 5th. Or watch all 1 hour 45 minutes (minus the 45 minutes of commercials) again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://abc.go.com/watch/lost/93372/261983/the-end">right now</a> (with fake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170829/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyKyjeRodd4">alternate endings</a>)! Your boss won&apos;t mind.</p>
