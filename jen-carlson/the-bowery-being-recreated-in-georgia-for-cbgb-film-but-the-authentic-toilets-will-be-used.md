<p>When we last checked in on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154206/http://gothamist.com/tags/cbgb">CBGB</a> biopic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154206/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/15/cbgb_getting_big_screen_treatement.php">we joked</a>, &quot;Somewhere, a set designer is recreating the venue&apos;s bathrooms.&quot; But the reality is so much better: they&apos;re using the real toilets from the legendary club. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154206/http://savannahnow.com/do/2012-06-08/cbgb-brings-iconic-new-york-club-savannah-graffitied-toilets-and-all#.T9JFzuJYvDM">The Savannah Morning News</a> reports that &quot;the actual bar, and toilets, of iconic club CBGB will be shipped here [to Savannah] and installed on the set of the movie. It&#x2019;s part of a meticulous process that&#x2019;s already transforming the interior of local Meddin Studios into an exact replica of the hallowed birthplace of punk rock.&quot;</p>

<p>Producer Jody Savin confirms: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re bringing in the original bar and the toilets&#x2014;those famous toilets. Graffiti and all.&#x201D; Presumably they&apos;ve been festering away in that warehouse in Williamsburg where the club&apos;s remains were stored, but this has us wondering if they&apos;ll be brought into the new CBGB <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154206/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/we_hear_cbgb_is_planning_to_reopen.php">when/if it opens</a>? </p>

<p>Sadly, the toilets will be one of the only authentic things in the movie, as it does seem as though the entire thing will be filmed in Georgia&#x2014;the creative director says, &#x201C;New York is so expensive, so there&#x2019;s a real incentive here.&#x201D; This means that right now, somewhere in Savannah, there is &quot;a lowered area where producers will shoot false exteriors of the Bowery, with virtual New York looking north across Louisville Road, west of downtown.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154206/http://evgrieve.com/2012/06/cbgb-biopic-will-have-authentic-toilets.html">EV Grieve</a>]</p>
