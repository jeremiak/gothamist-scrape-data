<p>NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly addressed Wallenda&apos;s dream yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630021655/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-commish-cuts-cord-wallenda-stunt-article-1.1381491?localLinksEnabled=false">saying</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;d be wise in this city. We have thousands of New Yorkers who certainly can be put at risk.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630021655/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/24/kelly-to-wallenda-you-will-not-be-doing-an-nyc-skyscraper-high-wire-act/">He added</a>, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s dangerous to cross the Grand Canyon, and obviously, there&#x2019;s water at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Here, we have thousands of New Yorkers.&quot; Presumably it would be too difficult to block off the area below, which spans around 9 blocks and 4,000 feet, not including a buffer area that would be needed.</p>

<p>And since Wallenda plays by the rules, with his stunts airing on television, don&apos;t expect him to pull some epic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130630021655/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/24/philippe_petit_man_on_wire.php">Philippe Petit</a> type thing.</p>
