Which means they are never, ever getting back together, but that $14.25 million asking price should get them through this difficult separation with their piece of real estate. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190031/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/conscious_uncoupling_gwyneth_paltro.php">former couple</a> purchased the home in 2007 for just $5.1 million, and while a $9.15 million mark-up may seem like a lot, their design team did add &quot;fuzzy nap zones.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you wondering what a $14.5 million three-bedroom apartment looks like? Or a &quot;fuzzy nap zone&quot;? Us too, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190031/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/3/8/11181018/gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-tribeca-apartment-sale">Curbed</a> only tracked down a floorplan so we only have our imagination.</p>

<p>Just turn on some Coldplay, close your eyes, and picture <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190031/http://hookedonhouses.net/2010/08/11/gwyneth-paltrows-tribeca-penthouse-in-vogue/">an all-white Tribeca home</a> with country strong wood paneling&#x2014;three bedrooms, a living room, a library, a walk-in closet for crying inside of. Now you&apos;re in the eat-in kitchen, with items you&apos;ve seen in Goop. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190031/http://shop.goop.com/collections/home/products/soyabella-automatic-soymilk-maker-110v-60hz">Automatic Nut Milk Maker</a>. Perfect circles of green juice spilled on the counter top. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190031/http://shop.goop.com/collections/home/products/knife-set">So many knives</a>. What&apos;s that smell? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190031/http://www.stereogum.com/1773884/gwyneth_paltrows_recipe_for_ro/vg-loc/videogum/">A chicken roasting in the oven</a>. Free-range. Always.</p>

<p>&quot;Fix You&quot; is lingering in the air, courtesy of Sonos. There&apos;s a balcony, and there&apos;s Gwyneth, wrapped in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190031/http://shop.goop.com/collections/home/products/blue-san-pedro-throw">a San Pedro throw</a>, smoking her one cigarette of the day. This could be you, for $14.25 million.</p>
