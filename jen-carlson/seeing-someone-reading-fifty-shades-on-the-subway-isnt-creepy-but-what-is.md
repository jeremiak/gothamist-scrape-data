<p>The Gray Lady is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215856/http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/is-it-creepy-to-see-someone-reading-fifty-shades-of-grey-on-the-subway/">posing a question</a> about the controversial Mr. Grey: &quot;Is It Creepy to See Someone Reading <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> on the Subway?&quot; While there are some creepy things about this phenomena&#x2014;just one example is the people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215856/http://www.flickr.com/photos/29485668@N05/7158645558/"><em>recreate the sex scenes with dolls</em></a>&#x2014;reading the book in public isn&apos;t one of them.

I am the coolest person in this city right now, and everyone on this train knows it.&quot; See, these women openly reading the BDSM book don&apos;t creep anyone out&#x2014;they inspire! They embolden! And honestly, if the worst thing you see underground is someone reading a book, you are lucky... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215856/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/30/top_10_viral_subway_videos_of_2011.php#photo-6">so lucky</a>.</p>
