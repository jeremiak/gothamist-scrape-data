<p>Move over, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174502/http://www.visitwilliamsburg.com/"><em>Colonial</em> Williamsburg</a>; the tourists are now flocking to Brooklyn&apos;s &apos;Burg to see what all the fuss is about (what is the all fuss about again?). A tipster sends us this photo, saying, &quot;This was a tour group that got off the subway at Driggs and North 7th. There was a person directing them and explaining where they were. The tour guide gave instructions to meet back at the subway entrance at a specific time and directed them to Bedford Avenue.&quot; Oh the things they must have seen!</p>
