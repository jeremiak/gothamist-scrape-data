										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="marinafranco05.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095508im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/marinafranco05.jpg" width="275" height="206" class="image-left"> </span>So this line at MoMA to sit in front of Marina Abramovi&#x107; is really long, you know, FYI. You pretty much have to clear your schedule and be prepared to wait around for at least a few hours... unless, of course, you are famous. Or so we hear. </p>

<p>The other day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095508/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/10/franco_3.php">James Franco</a> was first to sit in front of the performance artist, and we&apos;re pretty sure he&#x2014;or Lou Reed, or Sharon Stone&#x2014;didn&apos;t stand in line like regular museum patrons. <em>Like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095508/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/11/marina_2.php">Paco Blancases</a> of the world.</em> In fact, a source tells us the day Franco took a seat he was escorted into the museum a half hour early. And that&apos;s not all, our source says that this is *a thing*&#x2014;that friends of Marina always get special access and VIP treatment! That&apos;s right, folks: brazen elitism, right here in the egalitarian utopia of NYC. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted MoMA for a comment, hold your breath...</p>
