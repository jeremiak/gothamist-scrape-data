<p>This past July some NYPD officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141638/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/29/nypd_defends_photographers_rights.php">defended a civilian&apos;s right to photograph</a> when he was harassed by another civilian for snapping shots in the subway system. This was a surprising change, to say the least, in the force&apos;s previous attitude towards shutterbugs &#x2014; but since it came after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141638/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/nypd_get_lesson_in_photography.php">this department-wide memo</a> was sent out, it showed promise for the future.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141638/http://animalnewyork.com/2009/11/nypd-harasses-more-law-abiding-photographers/">Animal</a> points to a new incident, however, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141638/http://www.flickr.com/photos/yukonblizzard/4078834543/">photographer Steve Kelley</a> and his friend were detained after snapping some shots during a &quot;photo walk&quot; in Brooklyn Heights. Kelley says his buddy Chetan was taking a photo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141638/http://www.flickr.com/photos/csarva/4079048581/">this door</a>, which was allegedly described by some of New York&apos;s Finest as a so-called &#x201C;sensitive subject.&quot; Six officers showed up and took the two in for questioning, where they were even grilled on where they went to school. Hours later they were released.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the NYPD to find out if the memo will be going out again!</p>
