Metro-North Railroad is considering buying double-decker coaches for its Harlem and Hudson lines, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611061938/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/nyregion/16double.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">the New York Times</a>. The purchase would bring less crowded cars to the commuter lines, adding enough space for 1/3 more people to get on board.
