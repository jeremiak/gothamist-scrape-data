<p>While we got a dusting of snow last night (with more flurries possible tonight), Union Square got more than a few feet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120212215721/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/snow_is_coming_to_nyc_this_thursday.php">courtesy of I Love NY</a>. The faux snow is there for anyone to enjoy until 2 p.m. today (the little ones can even get snowboarding lessons), and we swung by last night as they were bringing the white stuff in. However, the only snow we spotted was this sad little pile. We contacted the organizers of the event to find out if any more was produced&#x2014;if you drop by, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120212215721/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">send us your photos</a>! And after 2 p.m., we&apos;re guessing this stuff is up for grabs, so start planning your afternoon snowball fight now.</p>
