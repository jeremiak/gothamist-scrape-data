<p>The above photo comes with a caption which reads: &#x201C;Reopening of the South Fork Bridge after flood in Nov. 1940. 1941 (?)&#x201D; The photo is believed to be real and unaltered, and can be found at  the virtual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207040202/http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/Search.do?Ne=8385&amp;Ns=Language|1&amp;N=8249+8100+8790&amp;ex=on&amp;lang=en">Bralorne Pioneer Museum</a>. So, what is that modern-day looking hipster with the fancy camera and sunglasses doing <em>in the 1940s</em>? Clearly, we have a time traveler on our hands.</p>

<p>Not so fast. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207040202/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2010/05/timetraveling_h.html">FreeWilliamsburg</a> supplies us with a giant buzzkill today, providing a link to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207040202/http://forgetomori.com/2010/fortean/time-traveler-caught-in-museum-photo/">this site</a>, which is doing its damnedest to prove this guy didn&apos;t travel from current day Williamsburg to 1940s Canada. In the end, however, even they&apos;re skeptical of their proof. They note, &quot;Pay attention to the right arm of the &apos;time traveller&apos;: you may realize that the arm actually belongs to the man right behind him. Why would another man&#x2019;s arm be in that position?&quot; Our answer: <em>invisible time traveler</em>. Discuss.</p>
