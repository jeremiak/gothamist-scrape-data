He&apos;s coordinated four days of music in Williamsburg, all of which you can see for just $45 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110308/http://www.northsidefestival.com/purchase-badges/">badges here</a>), though limited tickets are also available (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110308/http://www.smarttix.com/show.aspx?showcode=NOR3">here&apos;s a link</a> for tickets to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110308/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/05/week_in_rock_1.php?gallery0Pic=3#gallery">our show</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110308/http://brooklynbased.net/everything/our-very-own-sxsw/">Brooklyn Based</a>). Earlier this week he told us what it&apos;s been like to tackle the Northside endeavor, as well as flying water bugs.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did the idea for the Northside Festival come about?</strong> If I remember correctly, one day our Publisher, Scott Stedman, came running over to the corner of the office I share with Editor-in-Chief Jonny Diamond, yelling and screaming about this idea he had for a music festival that would be like a miniature CMJ, but specifically for Williamsburg. We mocked him openly, rolled our eyes, then quietly and begrudgingly acknowledged that, fuck, he actually may have been onto something. And here we are, six months later. He was right, we were wrong. Hopefully he never sees this.  </p>

<p><strong>What have you learned from planning this first one?</strong> Well, if you were to ask me this question again next Monday, I&apos;m sure I&apos;d have a completely different, much longer answer for you. As of now, I guess I&apos;ll just say that next year, it would be great if we didn&apos;t have to send the festival guide to the printer on the same day as a regular issue of The L -- especially if that issue happens to be the Summer Music Preview.  </p>

<p><strong>What bands are you most looking forward to see?</strong> I&apos;m a pretty big Hold Steady nerd, so I&apos;ll definitely be at Music Hall for that on Thursday night. Aside from that and maybe Sunset Rubdown, whose new record I&#x2019;m liking a lot more than anything else I&#x2019;ve ever heard from the whole Wolf Parade/Sunset Rubdown/Handsome Furs clan, I&#x2019;ll probably just be wandering from venue to venue trying to see as many bands as possible while drinking as much free or heavily discounted beer as possible.</p>
