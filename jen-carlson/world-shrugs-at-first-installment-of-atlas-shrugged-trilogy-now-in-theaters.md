<p>Tea partying libertarians unite! Ayn Rand&apos;s Objectivist tome has made it to the big screen, at long last, and as <em>a trilogy</em>. In 1991 the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club ranked the 1957 bestselling novel as the 2nd most influential book <em>ever</em>, the Bible came in 1st place. So how will the movie live up to the printed word? It&apos;s not lookin&apos; so good. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323214326/http://www.atlasshruggedpart1.com/">Part One</a> is in theaters today (tax day!), and the reviews are out; here are some gems:</p>

<ul><li>&quot;I am faced with this movie, the most anticlimactic non-event since Geraldo Rivera broke into Al Capone&#x2019;s vault.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323214326/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110414/REVIEWS/110419990">Roger Ebert</a>
</li><li>&quot;The movie, the first installment of a projected trilogy, doesn&#x2019;t give the book a fair shake. In terms of craftsmanship it&#x2019;s barely professional...&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323214326/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703385404576259082257666152.html">WSJ</a>
</li><li>&quot;At least with the 1949 version of <em>The Fountainhead</em>, you had the sense of actors clawing their way through Rand&apos;s philosophy toward a human feeling or two. This movie is crushingly ordinary in every way...&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323214326/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/sc-mov-0413-atlas-shrugged-20110415-33,0,179159.story">The LA Times</a>
</li><li>&quot;[A] mess, full of embalmed talk, enervated performances, impoverished effects, and cinematography that would barely pass muster in a TV show.&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323214326/http://reason.com/archives/2011/04/14/atlas-shrugged-part-1">Reason</a></li></ul>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s a ton of merch being hawked on the movie&apos;s website: mousepads, iPhone 4 covers, aprons!, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323214326/http://www.atlasshruggedpart1.com/bracelet">the Official Rearden Metal Bracelet</a>, starting at $159! As one Rand fan proclaimed in the comments: &quot;I love capitalism, I love profit, I love money... BUT, I do not value this at $159. Thus, I will not buy it.&quot;</p>
