</div></div>					<p>Last night the City Reliquary pretty much brought the FDNY Calendar to life with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233428/http://www.cityreliquary.org/fire-sale-playing-cards/">Fire Sale</a>! Firefighters took to the Knitting Factory stage to sell... themselves, all to benefit the Reliquary (which is trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233428/http://www.cityreliquary.org/city-reliquary-museum-civic-organization-2010-fundraising-campaign/">stay afloat</a>). Bids started at $50 and went over 300 bucks; winners were promised &quot;a real life opportunity to take one of New York&#x2019;s Bravest out on the town for a night of romance and adventure.&quot; </p>

<p>We sent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233428/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> to digitally capture the steamy action, and she tells us this gentleman in the video below got the highest bid (he <em>did</em> bring the booty bump, after all). He went for $305! She also tells us that the hostess you see on stage was so flirty that all of the men wanted to bid on her&#x2014;but bidding only got up to $165, when word got out she&apos;s married. And it seems as though not all of the ladies were there to meet the fireman of their dreams, the winning bid for the hostess was actually from a girl.</p>
