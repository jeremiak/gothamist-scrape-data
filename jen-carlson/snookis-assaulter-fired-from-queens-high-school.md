<p>The Queens gym teacher who punched America&apos;s beloved Snooki in the face on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065555/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> has now been fired. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065555/http://www.tmz.com/2010/01/12/snooki-jersey-shore-mtv-brad-ferro-punch-fired-school-new-york/">TMZ reports</a> that the NYC Department of Education is currently drafting Brad Ferro&apos;s termination letter, and upon receiving it, he&apos;ll have 30 days to box up his stuff at North Queens Community High School. </p>

<p>Ferro socked Snooki in the kisser last August, when the show was filming at Beachcomber Bar &amp; Grill in Seaside Heights. After using the clip to their promotional advantage, MTV <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065555/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/14/mtv_pull_jersey_shore_sucker_punch.php">decided not to air it</a> during that episode after all &#x2014;&#xA0;but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130906065555/http://www.boblauer.com/guidette.gif">animated GIF</a> became a viral sensation.</p>

<p>Ferro has also been found guilty of &quot;simple assault&quot; and was fined $500, as well as given a 6 month suspended jail sentence.</p>
