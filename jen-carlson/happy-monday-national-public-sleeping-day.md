<p>It&apos;s only fitting that National Public Sleeping Day fall on a rainy Monday in the midst of SAD-season... and here we are. Yes, this is allegedly an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303013938/http://www.theultimateholidaysite.com/holidays/2010-2/#!national-public-sleeping-day">actual holiday</a> celebrating sleeping in public, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303013938/http://living.oneindia.in/expressions/factual-expressions/2011/public-sleeping-day-280211-aid0111.html">this site</a> has some suggestions on where to doze off, including buses and public restrooms. Terrible, terrible ideas for New Yorkers, of course... so where is a good place to fall asleep in public in this city? Our top 5 suggestions below:</p>

<ul><li>Under the Manhattan Bridge archway in DUMBO&#x2014;they have nice long benches, plus you&apos;ll be covered from the rain. Bonus: the rumbling of the subway above is like white noise.
</li><li>Under your desk at work, but not the full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303013938/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W__qCFWi1KA">George Costanza way</a> so that no one sees you.
</li><li>On the subway, but make sure you set an alarm and don&apos;t end up at the end of the line.
</li><li>At the movies, perhaps watching one of the Oscar-winning films.
</li><li>In the lobby of the Algonquin&#x2014;surely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303013938/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/the_algonquin_gets_a_new_matilda.php">the new Matilda</a> will share her chaise lounge.</li></ul>

<p>If you attempt a public nap today, it may be best to have a friend around&#x2014;in which case, have them snap your photo and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303013938/mailto:photo@gothamist.com">send it to us</a>! Bonus points for getting some shut eye at a New York City landmark.</p>
