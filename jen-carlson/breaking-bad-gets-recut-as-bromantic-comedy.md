                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="mainbreakingbadbromance.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014707im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/mainbreakingbadbromance.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Nothing will ever be as good as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014707/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkVWuP_sO0"><em>The Shining</em> recut</a> from 2006, but when someone sent us a link titled &quot;Breaking Bad as Romantic Comedy&quot; the sound of clicking in the office was deafening. </p>

<p>The creators were working with very little light meat here, as the show is 99.9% dark. Like, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014707/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/11/five_thoughts_before_watching_break.php"><em>real dark</em></a>. Like, not even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014707/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVpv8-5XWOI">that Train song</a> can make it seem not dark. So considering that, they did a pretty good job! Check out the complicated tale of a married chemistry teacher who falls for local bad boy Jesse Pinkman... who (spoiler!) defies science and gets pregnant. It&apos;s the Breaking Bad Bromance you&apos;ve been waiting for...</p>
