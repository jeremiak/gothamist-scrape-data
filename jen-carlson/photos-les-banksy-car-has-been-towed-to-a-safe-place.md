</div></div>					<p>Around 10 a.m. we received an email from a tipster along with a photo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214202620/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a>&apos;s LES creation (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141214202620/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/new_dramatic_banksy_piece_goes_up_o.php#photo-1">went up on October 9th</a>), saying the doors of the car had been ripped off. And around 2 p.m. today a crew had moved in to remove the installation&#x2014;reader Tal tells us, &quot;The guys said they were taking it to a gallery on behalf of the artist. Because the doors were stolen off the car... they didn&apos;t want it to be further vandalized.&quot; </p>

<p>Around 2:30 p.m. it was already on the tow truck, and now the truck is gone... Let us know if you&apos;ve seen the truck and we can start the process all over again!</p>

<p>As for the truck that Banksy painted, that sat behind the car, it is still in the lot &quot;exposed to public,&quot; as of 2:40 p.m. But &quot;there&#x2019;s a guy guarding the truck in the lot while they go to get another truck to pull it away.&quot;</p>
