At least, those are the rumors that accompany news the band is hitting the road for the first time in 20 years with original lead singer David Lee Roth. We suppose if Mick Jagger is still at it - Roth can probably still &quot;jump&quot; at the age of 53 (though we hope he leaves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172705/http://www.rotharmy.com/gallery/Classic_Van_Halen_Pictures/PN016940.jpg">the assless chaps</a> at home). </p>

<p>With Genesis, Rage Against the Machine, The Smashing Pumpkins, Jesus and Mary Chain, Crowded House (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172705/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/01/reunion_mania_m.html">more</a>)  set to tour this year, and rumors of a Police tour, 2007 is shaping up to be the year of the comeback kid. Van Halen will also be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year - perhaps by then they will have signed the contract with Live Nation for 40 shows.</p>

<p>Roth quit Van Halen in 1985 after clashing with lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who as of now is set to tour. However, the role of original bassist Michael Anthony will be played by Eddie Van Halen&apos;s son Wolfgang.</p>

<p>If they do hit New York, it won&apos;t be too hard for Roth to get to the show - we&apos;re pretty sure he lives above LES restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172705/http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/37542004">&apos;noteca</a>. </p>
