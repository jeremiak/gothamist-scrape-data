<p>The Bryant Park movies get pretty crowded... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205031805/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/bryant_park_movies_1.php">like really crowded</a>, and sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205031805/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/28/glenn_beck_family_receive_chilly_we.php">this guy</a> shows up. But what&apos;s it like to be <em>in</em> that mass of movie-watchers? One man made this amazing video from this week&apos;s screening of <em>39 Steps</em>&#x2014;not for the demophobic!</p>
