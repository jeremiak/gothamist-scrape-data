</div></div>					<p>Yesterday Bruce Springsteen traveled to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141001/http://www.ellisisland.org/">Ellis Island</a> with his mother and aunts to be honored with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141001/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2010/04/bruce-springsteen-celebrates-his-heritage/1">an Ellis Island Family Heritage Award</a>. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Inc. presents the award to immigrants and/or their descendants &quot;who have made a major contribution to the American experience,&quot; and even though Bruce was Born in the U.S.A., his family roots are in Italy&#x2014;his maternal great-grandmother, Raffaela Zerilli, arrived at Ellis Island on October 3rd, 1900.</p>

<p>At the ceremony Springsteen declared: &quot;These fabulous women, they are my living connection to my heritage, to Ellis Island. They have personified for me the tough optimism and the work ethic of first-generation-born American citizens. You can&apos;t really know who you are and where you&apos;re going unless you know where you came from.&quot; Though surely The Boss can take care of the entire family now, his 87-year-old aunt still works as a hairdresser and his 67-year-old aunt is still available to help out with your taxes!</p>
