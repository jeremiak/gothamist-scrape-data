<p>Out of the hundreds of historical statues in all of New York City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828105928/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/12/statues_in_nyc.php#photo-1">only a handful are portrayals of real women</a>. In case you are wondering if you clicked on an article from a hundred years ago, no, you haven&apos;t, it is 2015. Joan of Arc was the first, and the others are Eleanor Roosevelt, Gertrude Stein, Golda Meir, and Harriet Tubman.</p>

<p>The great-great-grandaughter of suffragist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828105928/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>, Coline Jenkins, is part of a campaign to bronze more women, specifically in Central Park, which has 22 statues honoring men, and zero statues honoring women. Alice, Mother Goose, Juliet, angels, nymphs and allegorical figures <em>do not count</em>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828105928/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/nyregion/fighting-to-bring-women-in-history-to-central-park.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">the NY Times</a>, Mitchell Silver, the commissioner of New York City&#x2019;s parks department, had told Jenkins he was unaware of the lack of non-fictional female statues in the Park&#x2014;&#x201C;I didn&apos;t know that. O.K., I&#x2019;ll look into it.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Now Jenkins may be close to getting Central Park&apos;s number up from 0 to 2, with help from UES resident Myriam Miedzian, who has been spearheading this effort for two years. On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828105928/http://www.centralparkwherearethewomen.org/">the campaign&apos;s website</a>, Miedzian expertly states what a big problem this really is: &quot;The absence of sculptures honoring real women reinforces the erroneous view that women have not made notable achievements nor contributed major advancements to our society. The time has come to focus on and foster respect for women&#x2019;s achievements and the vast and varied contributions they have made to this world as well as to provide young women with important role models.&quot; </p>

<p>In the past, proposals for statues honoring Brooke Astor and Princess Diana have failed, and an unwritten moratorium that was set in the 1950s may be partially to blame&#x2014;this stated that no more permanent installations within the Park&apos;s footprint should go up. This is not a real excuse, however, and certainly doesn&apos;t excuse the lack of women elsewhere in the city.</p>

<p>The good news is, things are moving forward&#x2014;from the Times piece:</p>

<blockquote>In May, the parks department granted conceptual approval to the effort to erect a statue dedicated to Stanton and Anthony at the West 77th Street entrance to Central Park. The site lies adjacent to the mighty bust of Alexander von Humboldt, an 18th- and 19th-century Prussian naturalist, and near the Zeus-like effigy to Theodore Roosevelt at the entrance to the American Museum of Natural History.</blockquote>

<p>The only thing standing in the way of making this a reality is... around $1 million, which they hope to get through fundraising (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828105928/https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=HCZPQ4XXB7NN2">donate here</a>). There will also be a design competition run by the city&#x2019;s Public Design Commission.</p>

<p>We have reached out the Parks Department for further comment on the lack of female statues in the City, and will update if we hear back.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> NYC Parks Commissioner Mitchell J. Silver, FAICP, has given us this statement: &quot;This administration is fully committed to promoting gender equity across New York City&#x2014;and that includes our parks. It&#x2019;s long past time for us to honor the historical contributions Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony made to the fight for women&#x2019;s equality, which is why I&#x2019;m thrilled to move this effort forward.&quot;</p>
