Earlier this morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604161833/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/09/gavin_degraw.php">we heard</a> that DeGraw was beaten up in the East Village by some men at 4 a.m. Monday, before being hit by a cab about 13 blocks away. DeGraw has been recuperating at Bellevue Hospital, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604161833/http://twitter.com/#!/GavinDeGraw/status/101032491422457856">just Tweeted</a>, &quot;Honestly, I don&apos;t remember much.&quot;</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604161833/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20516823,00.html">People</a> picks up some more puzzle pieces. A police source told them that &quot;some kind of argument&quot; broke out between him and a group of men he didn&apos;t know, and the words escalated to violence. DeGraw was alone at the time of the fight, but is a New York City resident and co-owns a bar with his brother, called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604161833/http://www.thenationalunderground.com/aboutus.html">National Underground</a>, nearby where the scuffle occurred.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear who exactly attacked him, and how he walked so far before being hit by the cab. In fact, pretty much everything was unclear, because DeGraw was presumably blackout drunk. A rep told People, &quot;We have no additional details at this time,&quot; but police hope that security cameras will help in their investigation.</p>
