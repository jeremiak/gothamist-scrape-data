<p>Almost 100 years after the tragedy, researchers have assembled a massive North Atlantic debris field map of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212645/http://gothamist.com/tags/titanic">the Titanic</a>&apos;s wreckage, something that&apos;s never been done before. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212645/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/titanic-ve-photos-offer-breathtaking-map-miles-wreckage-article-1.1036289#ixzz1oeylytNG">the Daily News</a>, they took 130,000 photos using underwater robots and solar imaging, which together created the most in-depth look we&apos;ve ever had of the 3 x 5-mile underwater debris field. A senior VP at the History Channel, who spearheaded the project, says, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got this vision of the entire wreck that no one has ever seen before. Because we have, we&#x2019;re going to be able to reconstruct exactly how the wreck happened. It&#x2019;s ground-breaking, jaw-dropping stuff.&#x201D; Take that, James Cameron.</p>

<p>With the sonar maps, it&apos;s easier for Titanic researchers to see the entire site, without missing parts&#x2014;or as one historian put it, &quot;it&apos;s like suddenly the entire room lit up and you can go from room to room with a magnifying glass and document it. Nothing like this has ever been done for the Titanic site.&quot;</p>

<p>So why do we need to keep delving into the shipwreck? According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212645/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP5418122d89db429aa1d9fbde81035ddc.html">Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;By examining the debris, investigators can now answer questions like how the ship broke apart, how it went down and whether there was a fatal flaw in the design. The layout of the wreck site and where the pieces landed provide new clues on exactly what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>The History Channel will air their findings in a two-hour documentary on April 15th, exactly 100 years after the Titanic sank. But as we now know, we&apos;ve got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212645/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-201203091118usnewsusnwr201203080308publicopinionmar09,0,1560200.story">the supermoon to blame</a>.</p>
