<p>Expect some changes at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180216/http://mtr.org/">Museum of TV and Radio</a>. Today the museum announced it will not only no longer be referred to as a museum (the word didn&apos;t test well with the under-40 crowd!), but that it&apos;s throwing the &quot;TV and Radio&quot; out of its moniker for good, too. Good-bye, MTR.  Hello, The Paley Center for Media.  From the press release:</p><blockquote>The thirty-one-year-old institution will be renamed The Paley Center for Media to better reflect MTR&#x2019;s evolution to a center that convenes media leaders and enthusiasts for programs that explore and illuminate the immense and growing impact of all media on our lives, culture, and society. The new name, approved by the board, is effective immediately.<p></p>

<p>The name takes its inspiration from William S. Paley, the institution&#x2019;s founder, a pioneering innovator in the industry who built the CBS Network, launched an early foray into cable programming, and diversified the numerous elements of his broadcasting empire to include music, sports, entertainment, and other enterprises.</p></blockquote>The Paley Center For Media, which we&apos;ll probably always refer to as the MTR out of habit, will be taking focus from its archive of television and radio programs and recreating itself as a place for industry leaders and the public to discuss media in society. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180216/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/arts/design/05pale.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin">The NY Times</a> reports that &quot;the number of panels and interview sessions is being doubled, and online media executives and creators will increasingly be part of those discussions.&quot; Hello, everything that is encompassed by the term &quot;media&quot;!  What&apos;s cool is that the former MTR&apos;s events, such as discussions with casts of shows like House, Entourage, Law &amp; Order, Grey&apos;s Anatomy, and Weeds, will be available online.  The Paley Center also has a collection of over 140,000 clips and programs from over 100 years - one that you can search through and view.<p></p>

<p>Why all this change? The <strike>museum</strike> center has to keep up with the times, just like everything else. But, was a brand overhaul really necessary?  A MT&amp;R; member we spoke to said, &quot;I think the name change is probably for the better. In the traditional sense, it was never much of a &apos;museum&apos; - and this led to a lot of confused tourists.&quot; Yes, the &quot;museum&quot; thing is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180216/http://www.mtr.org/about/about-faq.htm#see">number 1 question on the FAQ</a>.</p>
