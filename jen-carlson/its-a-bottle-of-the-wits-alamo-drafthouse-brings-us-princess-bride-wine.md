<p>The Alamo Drafthouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212827/http://drafthouse.com/blog/entry/alamo_drafthouse_unveils_signature_wine_line_the_bottle_of_wits">has announced</a> an amazing wine pairing with their February 14th screening of <em>The Princess Bride</em>: the Bottle of the Wits! The new wine line was also created to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie, and includes a red and a white&#x2014;choose wisely. Or choose <em>both!</em> The Alamo Drafthouse may be based out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212827/http://austinist.com/">Austin</a>, but the fine folks will let all of America uncork a bottle, with a promise that online ordering will be available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212827/http://princessbridewine.com/">any day now</a>. </p>

<p>As you can see, the packaging is gorgeous, but what&apos;s going on inside? The &#x201C;Inconceivable Cab&#x201D; is a 2009 vintage California Cabernet, and while it has lingering notes of cedar and vanilla, you won&apos;t even smell the iocane powder. Then there&apos;s the &#x201C;As You Wish White,&quot; which they call a &quot;refreshing California blend with tropical fruit and green apple aromas.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, we can&apos;t place an order for an entire Alamo Drafthouse, because we&apos;d love to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212827/http://drafthouse.com/blog/entry/alamo_drafthouse_unveils_signature_wine_line_the_bottle_of_wits">a Princess Bride Valentine&#x2019;s Day Quote-Along Feast</a> on Valentine&apos;s Day, too. We already have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212827/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/giant_rat.php">the ROUSs</a>!</p>
