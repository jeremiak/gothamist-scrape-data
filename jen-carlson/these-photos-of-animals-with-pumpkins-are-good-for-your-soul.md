</div></div>					<p>Every year around this time, the city&apos;s zoo animals get to play with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162129/http://gothamist.com/tags/pumpkins">pumpkins</a>. Sometimes they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162129/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gBxCh8fOTw">filled with bloody meat</a> and torn to shreds and we get to watch it all play out while sipping on our Pumpkin Spice Lattes. Autumn is magical. The Wildlife Conservation Society has started to quietly leak some images from their zoos and the aquarium, click through for a look while we await more more more (and video).</p>
