<p>Hey, smoking at gas stations is dangerous! Last night Courtney Love performed for a crowd of around 1,000 at Alexander Wang&apos;s fashion week after party, which took place the Mobil Gas Station on 10th Avenue, of course. Thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132452/http://twitter.com/womensweardaily/status/3947581685">WWD</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132452/http://twitter.com/justinrocket">Justin Rocket</a>&apos;s Twitterering, we know that there was also free candy inside the gas station and &quot;Pixie Geldof and Devon Aoki stocked up on Nerds&quot; (hipster elite, they&apos;re just like us!). Soon after, Love was back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132452/http://twitter.com/courtneylover79/status/3951622063">to Twittering</a> herself, saying, &quot;we had way fun tonight for Alexander (Wang) sorry we mangled &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707132452/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcS5E_Mi4Uo">Unsatisfied</a>&apos; westerberg but they were so fashionista they didnt know dick.&quot; Sorry, but we sort of love her for that.</p>

<p>P.S. We also hear that  Jared Leto, Mischa Barton and hundreds of guests continued lighting cigarettes directly adjacent to the gas pumps, but &quot;as of 3am, when the party cleared out, no fires or explosions had broken out.&quot;</p>
