<p>Is your DVR hiking up your electric bill? Yes, yes it is. According to a new report released by the Natural Resources Defense Council (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109140913/http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/settopboxes.pdf">PDF</a>), that magic machine you use to record <em>The Real Housewives</em> is using &quot;<strong>more than half the energy of an average new refrigerator and more than an average new flat panel TV</strong>.&quot; And you really can&apos;t do anything about it if you&apos;re using the DVR to record shows when you aren&apos;t home!</p>

<p>A scientist with the NRDC says, &quot;When not displaying or recording video content, U.S. television set-top boxes (STBs) continue to use almost as much power as when they are in use. The consumer, who pays the electric bill, has little choice about what television set-top box the service provider installs and how much energy it uses.&quot; And with 160 million American&apos;s using these boxes, which <em>never sleep</em>, that&apos;s quite the racket!</p>

<p>You can start a rebellion by asking Time Warner or Cablevision to supply you with a box <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109140913/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/06/cable-tv-set-top-boxes-energy-hogs/1">that meet ENERGY STAR Version 4.0</a>... surely they&apos;ll be happy to oblige.</p>
