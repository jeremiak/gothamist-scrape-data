</div></div>					<p>The carriage house is the ideal New York City home. You don&apos;t have to deal with anyone living in the same building as you&#x2014;which means no neighbor noise, no unwanted interaction, and sweet serenity in a chaotic and loud city. It&apos;s like living in one of those peaceful padded rooms, but with SubZero appliances. The most perfect examples of these homes can be found in Brooklyn Heights, where even neighborhood brownstone owners look on with envy. </p>

<p>One of the neighborhood&apos;s carriages houses, at 165 Columbia Heights, is now on the market. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108014514/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/08/11/restored_brooklyn_heights_carriage_house_asks_10m.php">Curbed</a> notes it used to belong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108014514/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/big-deal-jehovahs-witnesses-list-prime-properties/">to the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses</a> (much of the area&apos;s real estate has), but was sold in 2012 and completely renovated (with approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission). The asking price is $9.95 million, but looking inside is free...</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108014514/http://www.sothebyshomes.com/nyc/sales/00110269">the listing</a>, the historic home is from the 1860s, and features a &quot;3-Car Garage, expansive open living space, 4 Bedrooms, 3.5 Bathrooms, and a beautiful planted Roof Terrace.&quot; There&apos;s also a dramatic staircase, a fireplace, a skylight, and imported, wide plank, smoked oak floors throughout.</p>
