Creator Zach van Schouwen even made each building clickable so you can get the individual histories of them. His own inspiration came from trying to discover more about a building his great-great-grandfather lived in &#x2014; a five-story tenement at 218 Eldridge Street. He says, &quot;With some help from Christopher Gray&apos;s guide to researching New York City buildings, I discovered that the building had been erected in 1834, on the site of an old house. It was demolished in the 1940s; its lot later held a garage, then a housing project.&quot;</p>
