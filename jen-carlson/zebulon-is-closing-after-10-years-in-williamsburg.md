<p>There was a time when we used to go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043112/http://zebuloncafeconcert.com/">Zebulon</a> on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg even though we knew it would be packed and we&apos;d probably end up standing in the hallway just inside the door, pressed up against strangers and fully giving up hope that we&apos;d ever get a drink. But we knew once we got claustrophobic we could just dip into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043112/http://gothamist.com/tags/relish">Relish</a> across the street. Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043112/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/williamsburg_diner_relish_leaves_de.php#photo-1">Relish closed</a>. And now: Zebulon is closing. Can we just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043112/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/wythe.php">blame the Wythe Hotel</a>? </p>

<p>In a press release we received late this afternoon, the venue&apos;s owners said goodbye to all of that:</p><blockquote>&quot;On Sunday, Dec 9 Zebulon will be closing its doors after ten exciting years of pioneering music and arts. <strong>Williamsburg has changed significantly since we opened, and unfortunately it is no longer possible today to continue the business in the manner in which it was conceived. </strong> Nevertheless, it&apos;s been a great run. This is our final week so if you haven&apos;t been down in a while, please come and say hello/wave goodbye, and pay your respects to this gem of an institution.&quot;</blockquote>Their final week will include appearances by TV on the Radio&apos;s Kyp Malone, The Arcade Fire&apos;s Sarah Neufeld, and more. As always, there will be no covers, and a happy hour lasting from 5 to 8 p.m.<br>
