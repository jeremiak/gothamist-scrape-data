<p>Did you know that foam-core miniature Guggenheims are used to design upcoming exhibitions at the museum? One of the web developers there just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152706/http://twitter.com/#!/rdmond/status/48379075575816192">Tweeted</a> some photos of the models currently being used. Not <em>so</em> different from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152706/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/21/guggenheim_turns_50_years_young_tod.php">the original</a>... but that color doesn&apos;t look like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503152706/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/16/painting_the_gu.php">London Fog <em>or</em> Powell Buff</a>!
