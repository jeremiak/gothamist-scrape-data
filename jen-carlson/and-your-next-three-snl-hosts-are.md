<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018221811/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/25/videos_alec_baldwin_radiohead.php">Alec Baldwin</a> can&apos;t host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018221811/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> forever, and Radiohead can&apos;t always be the musical guest, it&apos;s time to move on. This week it was announced that Ben Stiller will be hosting on October 8th, with musical guest Foster The People. And following his stint, on October 15th, Anna Faris and Drake will be taking over the studio. Stiller was a cast member in the 80s, and hosted last in 1998; Faris hosted one other time, in 2008.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018221811/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/09/26/ben-stiller-anna-faris-snl/">EW</a> is hoping that Stiller will get his <em>Tower Heist</em> co-star Eddie Murphy back to studio 8H for a cameo.</p>

<p>This weekend, Melissa McCarthy (who just won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series) will be at the helm, with Lady Antebellum providing the tunes. This marks McCarthy&apos;s debut on the show&#x2014;what other first timers should SNL be handing hosting duties over to?</p>
