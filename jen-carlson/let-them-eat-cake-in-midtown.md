<span class="photo_caption">The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man bears a striking resemblance to the Pillsbury Doughboy.</span></p>

<p>So much for a healthy start to the morning. The Pillsbury Doughboy will be in town come sunrise, and he&apos;s promising &quot;a sweeter morning commute.&quot; </p>

<p>Armed with a giant cake of the United States, he will not only be handing out slices to the masses, but he&apos;ll also declare Park Avenue and 51st the Sweetest Spot in New York City (could have had us fooled). This is all to kick-off the company&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161240/http://www.pillsburybaking.com/campaign">Campaign for a Sweeter America</a>; which in part has them donating more than 1,500 sweets to the New York Food Bank for delivery to community food programs throughout New York&#x2019;s five boroughs. </p>

<p>Giving sugary sweets to the impoverished sounds like a half-baked idea, but if you happen to be craving some cake come sun up, head over there for your slice; the Doughboy will be dishing it out through 2 p.m. </p>
