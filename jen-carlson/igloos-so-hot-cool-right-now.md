<p>This seems like something we&apos;ve seen on sitcom television before: a man built an igloo outside of his co-op building in Jackson Heights, Queens, and then spent a freezing cold night in it even though his wife was all, &quot;I really want a husband and not a corpse.&quot;(Seriously, how was this <em>not</em> an episode on that Kevin James <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120102221824/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165581/">show</a>?) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120102221824/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/11/2011-02-11_queens_stalwart_gets_the_best_of_snow_by_making_an_igloo_and_spending_the_night_.html">The Daily News</a> was on hand to do a little tire-kicking of the ice house; they say it&apos;s 2-tons, 10-feet long, and was constructed with about 100 bricks of snow.</p>

<p>The mastermind behind the project, Joe Gindoff, told the paper, &quot;It&apos;s a fully functional igloo, and I want to prove it by sleeping in it. Because of the extreme weather, I thought it would be a good idea to put the igloo to the real test. A couple people said they&apos;d stop by and have hot chocolate with me.&quot; The 50-year-old lost his job two weeks ago as, of course, an air conditioning service manager. </p>

<p>Gindoff&apos;s buddy declared, &quot;This is not just a nickel-and-dime igloo. That&apos;s one hell of an igloo.&quot; <em>But is it?</em> Because over in Brooklyn (on Macon between Throop and Marcus Garvey), artist Kilroy III created this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120102221824/http://www.bedstuyblog.com/2011/02/behold-castle-grayskull/"><em>Castle Grayskull igloo</em></a>. Perhaps Gindoff and Kilroy III can join forces to build a fully functional life-size Castle Grayskull. Challenge accepted, men?</p>
