</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174704/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/09/ridgewood.php">Last we checked</a>, the Ridgewood Theatre in Queens had its facade landmarked, and the former owners were seeking partners to help them get the space operational again. The fate of the 17,000-square-foot space&#x2014;which first opened in 1916 and is the longest-running movie house in the nation&#x2014;is still uncertain, however. Everything from a retail outlet to condos have been proposed, but now a group is banding together to make sure the historic building doesn&apos;t become a typical Myrtle Avenue storefront. To that end, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174704/http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=138383729516766">Friends of the Ridgewood Theatre</a> have started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174704/http://www.petitiononline.com/RTheatre/petition.html">a petition</a> to get the <em>interior</em> of the building landmarked as well (check out even more photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174704/http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=138383729516766&amp;v=photos">here</a>)&#x2014;they fear if this doesn&apos;t happen, &quot;the rare Adamesque interior by Thomas Lamb will be gone forever, and Queens and Brooklyn will be robbed of a true theater of great potential.&quot;</p>

<p>This summer the building was back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174704/http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2010/07/ridgewood-theatre-for-sale.html">on the market</a>, and at the time the realtor said, &quot;This is the best property in all of Queens if it&apos;s done right... Imagine a Queens version of Brooklyn Bowl.&quot; As for the group trying to save the spot, they&apos;re &quot;seeking a preservation-minded owner who will restore and creatively and adaptively reuse the theater, ideally as a performing arts center with community spaces. It would border 2 boroughs, serve up and coming Ridgewood and emerging art communities of Bushwick and Williamsburg, create jobs, enhance property values, be eligible for restorative grants and tax credits, and preserve an architectural and cultural landmark.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, something tells us this is going to become a mini mall or the nation&apos;s largest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302174704/http://www.yelp.com/biz/mandee-shop-ridgewood">Mandee</a>.</p>
