<p>Evan Bindelglass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423194555/http://www.wcbs880.com/pages/7668702.php?imageGalleryXRefId=1943192#imgXR">of WCBS</a> spotted a rainbow over the Hudson River yesterday, noting: &quot;this is what I saw from Fort Lee, NJ. If you look closely, you can actually see a second rainbow in some of the photos.&quot; Which is a pretty unenthusiastic response compared to the now famous double rainbow reaction from Paul Vasquez (aka the Yosemitebear Mountain Giant). However, he does give us a reason to <em>finally</em> post that video (and after the jump, a parody featuring the KFC Double Down).</p>

<p>Vasquez recently discussed the double rainbow he saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423194555/http://videogum.com/199572/double-rainbow-guy-interview-almost-as-good-as-double-rainbow-guys-video/interviews/">in an interview</a>, saying: &quot;You could feel the rays, like of the sun, but it was rainbow rays!&#x201D; No word yet from Bindelglass on whether or not he felt these magic rainbow rays...</p>
