---

	
										<p>New York City&apos;s rodent population is becoming a little bit too fearless. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325211039/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/video_rat_in_subway_car_crawls_over.php">This morning</a> we all witnessed a rat board the subway only to crawl onto a sleeping man&apos;s face, and now new video evidence shows that New York&apos;s Fearless are going after us in the airport as well. This was filmed at LaGuardia on Tuesday... and if that woman had spotted this little guy he would have most definitely suffered death by hot pink Ugg.</p>
