 <br>
His record is pretty impressive, he&apos;s organized 70 &quot;real dates,&quot; 19 of which turned into relationships that lasted over a year. The numbers could be higher but Ibrahim is selective on who he sets up.</p><blockquote>He listens to their conversations, asks them a few questions and then, if he thinks they are suitable, explains his matchmaking services and asks for their number and e-mail.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I want to know if they&apos;re the real deal or just a player,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&apos;re a player, then forget about it.&quot;</p></blockquote>In 2005, after being featured on The Today Show, news of his skills reached the west coast when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180446/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002164720_cabbie30.html">The Seattle Times</a> reported on one of his success stories; at the time they mention that his agent was shopping his story around Hollywood (where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509180446/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/19/moberg_goes_hol.php">every tale of love</a> ends up). <p></p>

<p>The 53-year-old Borough Park resident is recently single himself, saying &quot;When I was in high school I was looking for Miss Universe. In college I wanted Miss America. Now, Miss Brooklyn would do.&quot; Maybe Miss Right will step into his cab this Valentine&apos;s Day, when it will be adorned with roses and red and white hearts.</p>
