<p>This is hardly surprising, because while Lenox Hill Hospital denies they received money from Beyonc&#xE9; and Jay-Z to create a personalized VIP section for the birth of their daughter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172612/http://gothamist.com/tags/blueivy">Blue Ivy</a>... those suites certainly weren&apos;t built on love alone. The famous couple were the first to utilize the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172612/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/give_birth_in_beyonces_vip_hospital.php">$800/night</a> private suits (what coincidental timing!), and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172612/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/01/beyonce-jay-z-donation-lenox-hill-hospital-gave-birth">Radar reports</a> that they made a six figure donation to the hospital prior to the birth. </p>

<p>A source told the site, &#x201C;Jay Z and Beyonc&#xE9; made a very large donation to Lenox Hill Hospital several months ago&#x2014;the donation was at least $100K.&quot; That&apos;s 1/6th of the amount of money he allegedly spent on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172612/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/11/blue_ivy.php">a rocking horse</a> for his daughter. But how much do you think they paid to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120131172612/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45990587/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.TxCxkGNWq-0">this previously unnamed species of horse fly</a> named Beyonc&#xE9;?</p>
