title: Rock Steady Crew's Frosty Freeze Dies at 44
---

	
										<p>Wayne Frost, one of the original Bronx-based Rock Steady Crew and better known as Frosty Freeze, died at Mount Sinai Medical Center late last week at the age of 44; it was not specified of what, just that he had a &quot;long illness&quot;.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190427/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/arts/dance/04freeze.html?ref=dance">The NY Times</a> notes that Frost, who began breakin&apos; in 1976, garnered a lot of attention from a 1981 Village Voice cover which featured his photo along with the words: &#x201C;Physical Graffiti: Breaking Is Hard to Do.&#x201D; He was the first b-boy to get a magazine cover, and after that his moves were well documented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190427/http://imdb.com/name/nm0293693">in movies</a> like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190427/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/26/wild_style.php"><em>Wild Style</em></a> and <em>Style Wars</em> (both out in 1983). That same year, he even broke through to the more mainstream side of film when he appeared in <em>Flashdance</em>.</p>

<p>Many of his clips are online; you can watch him tear it up on the Lower East Side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190427/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwiv9gx0Ios">here</a>, and there&apos;s more from <em>Wild Style</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190427/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am02p5n8qjg&amp;e">here</a>. The below clips are from when he revisited <em>Style Wars</em> (whose director, Tony Silver, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190427/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/10/style_wars.php">died earlier this year</a> in February).</p>

<p>His long time friend, and well-known graffiti artist Zulu King Slone, called Freeze: &quot;a walking hip-hop culture encyclopedia.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226190427/http://www.nysun.com/news/obituaries/breakdance-pioneer-wayne-frost-dies-44">it&apos;s been said</a> &quot;he was one of the first B-boys that most people ever saw.&quot; But Wayne Frost says himself in the above video: &quot;I&apos;ll be remembered as a b-boy, but I&apos;m gonna live and die as a human.&quot;</p>
