<p>Slow clap, Marty Markowitz, for delivering this insane lineup for your final (in office) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820134718/http://www.brooklynconcerts.com/seaside.html">Seaside Summer Concert Series</a> and Martin Luther King Jr. Concert Series. The Brooklyn Borough President will ring out his last term to the sounds of Skynard, Huey Lewis, the Go Gos, Gladys Knight, Big Daddy Kane, and so many more nostalgic faves. (Marty&apos;s most excited for Cheap Trick, who he calls &quot;one of the greatest bands of all-time.&quot;)</p>
