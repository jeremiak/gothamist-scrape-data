<p>It was unsure if this was a stunt, or a suicide mission. If the former, Peter Vallone, Jr. will use it as another reason his proposed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172203/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/03/vallone_says_no.php">no-stunt bill</a> should be passed into law. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172203/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/man-scales-new-york-times-building/">CityRoom</a> is now reporting that the climber is an activist and is holding a banner that says: &#x201C;Global warming kills more people than 9/11 every week.&#x201D; It&apos;s likely that this has to do with World Environment Day, which is also what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172203/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/times_square_ge.php">the Times Square pop up</a> is for. He also is wearing a t-shirt plugging the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172203/http://thesolutionissimple.org/">thesolutionissimple.org</a>, and is believed to be Alain Robert -- who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172203/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/jailing-your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man/">scaled many buildings</a> in his time, including the Empire State Building.. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The NYPD&apos;s Emergency Service Unit has him in custody on the upper floor support beam.   </p>
