<p>Musician, vegan, and LES tea shop proprietor Moby wants to make a porno for the less endowed men out there, and the women or men who love them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111016001832/http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/62674063.html#ixzz1XwZ3Nd4A">Reportedly</a> he is fed up with X-rated films featuring men with members bigger than his, telling Bizarre magazine, &quot;Surely that&apos;s intimidating to most guys watching? My porn flick would exclusively feature men with normal-to-titchy-sized penises in order to make viewers feel better.&quot; Like, a parsnip instead of a daikon, to put it in vegan terms.</p>
