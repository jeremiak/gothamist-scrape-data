You know, when you&apos;ve totalled the rental car but the stereo still works and all you need is <em>something</em> until the tow truck comes? This is that formally febrile, meticulously messy <em>something</em>. </p>

<p>They&apos;re playing our show in Austin today, and will be playing a Todd P show in Brooklyn on March 30. </p>

<strong>Let&apos;s get this out of the way, where did your band name originate?</strong><br>
As I was stapling my W-2 to my 1040-EZ back in Apr 2002 I thought &quot;damn what a great band name this would make.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What is your first conscious memory of living in New York?</strong><br>
My parents accidentally left me behind at a Burger King when I was 3.  I remember being pretty scared.  Apparently when they came back to get me, I was found swinging the exterior door open and closed over and over again.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite place to drink in NYC, and what&apos;s the best night to go out?</strong><br>
Thursday because you can find parking (the band van is my &quot;car&quot;), yet it&apos;s basically a weekend.  I like Daddy&apos;s and occasionally The Magician if i&apos;m up for looking at bloggers.</p>
