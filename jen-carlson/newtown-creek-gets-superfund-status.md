<p>Newtown Creek (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073816/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/03/dolphin_spotted_in_newtown_creek.php">dolphins love it</a>) is following in the footsteps of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073816/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/27/video_gowanus_canal_will_consume_us.php">raw sewage spewing</a> Gowanus Canal&#x2014;yesterday the feds made the polluted body of water a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073816/http://gothamist.com/tags/superfund">Superfund</a> site.

The EPA&apos;s regional administrator declared &quot;this waterway has been contaminated over the past 150 years,&quot; and the designation will have them going after those who had a hand in polluting it. </p>

<p>Amongst their unsurprising roster of targets (which will have to help pay for cleanup) are BP, Exxon Mobil, National Grid, Chevron and Phelps Dodge.
