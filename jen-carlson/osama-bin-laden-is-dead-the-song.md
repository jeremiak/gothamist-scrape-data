<p>How did the fist-pumping <em>Jersey Shore</em> cast celebrate the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522052343/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/president_obama_about_to_make_annou.php">death of Osama bin Laden</a>? We&apos;re guessing this song was involved. 50 Cent protege Hot Rod slapped this tune together for release just 24 hours after the news came out. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522052343/http://www.thisis50.com/profiles/blogs/new-hot-rod-osama-bin-laden">This Is 50 Cent</a> says, &quot;G-Note Records artist Hot Rod wasted no time in getting out a new song celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden. Over a thumping club track, Rod implores everyone to get on the dance floor and party.&quot; That&apos;s just what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522052343/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/president_obama_about_to_make_annou.php">this historic moment</a> was missing: a thumping club track.</p>

<p>And how about <em>those lyrics?</em> &quot;Osama was killed tonight / So everybody come and have a good time / The great news made me lose my mind / So tonight I&#x2019;m gonna have a good time.&quot; Somewhere, the Black Eyed Peas are kicking themselves for not writing a timely follow-up to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522052343/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSD4vsh1zDA">I Gotta Feeling</a>.&quot; [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522052343/http://www.buzzfeed.com/gavon/50-cent-made-a-song-about-the-death-of-osama-bin-l">Buzzfeed</a>]</p>
