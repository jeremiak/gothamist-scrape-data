title: Video: Spend Two Minutes In 1970s Williamsburg
---

	
										<p>This video is just about two minutes long, but you&apos;ll get a nice glimpse of what 1970s Williamsburg looked like&#x2014;there are shots of the streets, a bus, a bodega, kids running through hydrants and riding their bikes, the intersection where Pies n&apos; Thighs is now, and even a bowling alley. <em>Where was that bowling alley?</em> Anyway, here&apos;s Williamsburg... before you gentrified it:</p>

<p>There&apos;s no description that goes along with the Youtube, only that this is in the southside of the neighborhood sometime during the 1970s... however, it&apos;s all soundtracked by Elton John&apos;s &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy,&quot; so maybe the footage is specifically from the time that song was released, 1975.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, neighboring Bushwick was &quot;a battleground for the police and young street criminals&quot; during that time&#x2014;revisit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121604/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/10/old_gang.php">this 1976 newscast</a>, which features the Devil&apos;s Rebels gang.</p>
