title: Brooklyn Girls Get Another Calendar
---

	
										<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152110/http://iheartbrooklyngirls.com/">I Heart Brooklyn Girls</a> calendar has been around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508152110/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/19/best_perverted.php">for a few years now</a>, each time changing its theme (last year Coney Island served as the backdrop throughout the 12 months). Coming up in 2009, the girls take on some pinup looks from the 40s and 50s in a &quot;Women at Work&quot; theme. </p>

<p>They tell us, &quot;this project offers a new crop of foxy, feisty femmes from Brooklyn, but is fashioned after images made popular by pinup artists Elvgren and Vargas. The calendar showcases a dozen campy career girls in authentic vintage garments, lingerie and swimwear.&quot; To get an even closer look, head to the launch party at Southpaw on October 10th.</p>
