										<p>Davey &#x201C;Dance&#x201D; Fishel has danced his way around the world, and landed back in his hometown of New York. Armed only with an iPod, a famous landmark, a Canon PowerShot, and the gift of improvised dance...he&apos;s moved his feet just about everywhere. Now he&apos;s got some amazing footage to show the grandkids one day, and of course to share with the rest of us now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326011723/http://www.vimeo.com/247850">Here&apos;s a dance number filmed at Coney Island</a>, and below from the Brooklyn Bridge (complete with back-up dancers and disaffected passerby): </p>
