<p>This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> called upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> to bring one of his priceless street art pieces to the wall of <em>The Colbert Report</em> during the street artist&apos;s time in New York. Or rather... tempted him <em>not</em> to: </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="COLBEAR1013.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/COLBEAR1013.jpg" width="640" height="410" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The next morning he woke up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/photo_hanksy_pays_tribute_to_stephe.php">to an original piece by... Hanksy</a> (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/photo_hanksy_pays_tribute_to_stephe.php">we spotted</a> yesterday morning). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203/http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/thu-october-10-2013-reed-albergotti---vanessa-o-connell">Last night</a>, he addressed the addition to his studio building wall:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Imagine my surprise this morning when I discovered this incredible work of art. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s more impressive: how he captured my likeness, or how he knew what I look like before I body wax. At first I thought this <em>was</em> Banksy, but it turns out the work was signed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a>. Who evidently is a well known New York street artist, whose work uses celebrity iconography to address the ephemeral nature of fame, specifically with terrible puns. His other works include Hamuel L. Jackson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228035203/http://gothamist.com/tags/gandalfini">Gandalfini</a>, and Meth Rogan. Powerful stuff, really makes you not think. 

<p>Now here I assume I am Stephen Col-Grizzly. But like Banksy, Hanksy&apos;s identity is a mystery. I think I cracked the code because Hanksy&apos;s first street art featured Tom Hanks, who happened to be my guest last night, which is when the lightbulb went off...&quot;</p></blockquote>We reached out to Hanksy for confirmation on this startling discovery and will update when we hear back.<p></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hanksy has responded: &quot;Welp. Now that my identity is revealed, I want to remind everyone to go see my movie <em>Captain Phillips</em>, which opens nationwide, today.&quot;</p>
