<p>Did you hear that UK retailer Top Shop is coming to town this fall? Before they cross the pond, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228223502/http://www.williamsburgisdead.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/08/splashenburten.html">Williamsburg is Dead</a> points out that they have some tips on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228223502/http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StaticPageDisplay?storeId=12556&amp;catalogId=19551&amp;identifier=ts1%20what%20to%20wear%201">how to dress for the McCarren Park Pool Parties</a> (where they&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228223502/http://www.fashionweekdaily.com/news/fullstory.sps?inewsid=6611633">temporarily set up shop</a>). Apparently nothing says a sweltering New York summer in a concrete pool like a nice warm woollen beanie!</p>

<p>The store arrives in town, by the way, about a month (or more) after the last McCarren Park Pool party. For now, however, they have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228223502/http://www.topshopnyc.com/diary.html">a blogger</a> covering each Sunday show, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228223502/http://www.topshopnyc.com/gallery.html">Hipster Gallery</a> (you&apos;re better than that, Top Shop) featuring photos taken by Nicky Digital, the poor man&apos;s Cobra Snake. (H&amp;M; would never stoop so low.)</p>
