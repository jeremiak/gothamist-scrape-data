<p>Shadow Traffic started as a CB club in Philadelphia by Michael Lenet, who went under the handle of &quot;Shadow&quot; and voluntarily dispersed information on the roadways to the motorists&#x2014;later he got the idea to bring it to radio stations. New York was the 3rd city after Chicago and Philly to adopt the service, which then got its traffic info from a fleet of planes, patrol cars, traffic spotters in the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center, constant communication with transit and police authorities, and the Shadow Box (a remote controlled CB receiver picking up conversations on the roadways). <br>
 <br>
In the video, Shadow program director Susan Murphy&#x2014;who was probably like the 1980s version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010059/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/14/talking_with_jamie_shupak_traffic_r.php">NY1&apos;s Jamie Shupak</a>&#x2014;says the &quot;catchy traffic lingo&quot; of the time was: bumper to bumper (&quot;that&apos;s a biggie&quot;), bottlenecks, and residual delays. So little has changed... one might say it seems like catchy traffic lingo has been at a <em>standstill</em> for decades.</p>

<p>In 1988, the NY Times published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010059/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/11/nyregion/a-day-s-work-for-shadow-traffic.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">a day in the life of Shadow</a>, which is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010059/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Traffic">a subsidiary of Clear Channel</a>, and &quot;operates a number of local and regional news and traffic operations that provide regular reports to affiliates.&quot;</p>
