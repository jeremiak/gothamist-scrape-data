<p>Back in July the lovable Sad Panda <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709025313/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/17/sad_pandas_gone_missing.php">went missing</a> from his regular spot downtown, leaving the city traumatized by his sudden disappearance. But miracles do happen, people, and as of today <em>he has returned!</em> And it looks like he even got himself a new set of hands.</p>

<p>A reader sends along this photo and tells us: &quot;Just wanted to report that this morning I got off the subway at Bowling Green. I rounded the corner of the park, and there, amazingly, was Sad Panda! He&apos;s back! Panda tip cup and all. It&apos;s really amazing how happy some guy in a panda costume can make a person.&quot; Indeed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709025313/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadpanda">Sad Panda</a>, please don&apos;t leave us again.</p>
