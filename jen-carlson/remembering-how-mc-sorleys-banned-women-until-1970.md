<p>Even though it was owned by a woman&#x2014;upon his death in 1939, Daniel O&apos;Connell left the saloon to his daughter Dorothy O&apos;Connell Kirwan&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408050520/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcsorleys">McSorley&apos;s Old Ale House</a> didn&apos;t allow women inside. Here&apos;s Kirwan in 1954 being served a beer outside in the cold of February, during the saloon&apos;s 100 year anniversary:</p>

<p>This all changed in the summer of 1970, when the National Organization for Women took their discrimination case against the bar to District Court, and won. (Women didn&apos;t get their own bathroom until 1986, however.) The NY Times reported on the ruling that June: </p><blockquote>&quot;There was a trace of wistfulness in the ruling by District Court Judge Walter R. Mansfield ordering the doors of the tavern opened to both sexes. &apos;It may be argued that the occasional preference of men for a haven to which they may retreat from the watchful eye of wives or womanhood in general, to have a drink or pass a few hours in their own company, is justification enough: that the simple fact that women are not men justifies defendant&apos;s practices.&apos; However, the judge concluded, &apos;The answer is that McSorley&apos;s is a public place, not a private club, and that the preference of certain of its patrons is no justification under the equal-protection clause of the United States Constitution.&apos;&quot;</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Mayor Lindsay signed a bill on August 10th, 1970 prohibiting discrimination in public places on grounds of sex, and women began showing up at the bar around 3 p.m. that day. (Clubs, however, are still allowed to be men&apos;s only&#x2014;like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408050520/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/can_you_guess_where_this_breakfast.php">The Racquet and Tennis Club</a>.) The event made it to the front page of the Daily News on the 11th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408050520/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/daily-news-front-page-august-11-headline-end-tombs-riot-news-photo/180784310">with a photo</a> of reporter Marcia Kramer drinking inside the bar, and the words: &quot;Liberated At Last.&quot;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408050520/http://www.mcsorleysnewyork.com/history_time_05.html">McSorley&apos;s website</a>, &quot;Danny Kirwan want[ed] his mother to be the first woman served. She refuses citing [a] promise she made her father.&quot;</p>
