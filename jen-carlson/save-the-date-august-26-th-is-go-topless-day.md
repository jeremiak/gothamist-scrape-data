<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222334/http://gothamist.com/tags/toplessday">annual GoTopless Day</a> event is coming up on Women&apos;s Equality Day, August 26th, and this year they celebrate five years strong. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222334/http://gotopless.org/gotopless-day">to the BoobMap</a> (their term!), this year&apos;s gathering will start in Bryant Park around 12 noon, ending around 3 p.m. in Times Square, where there will be some live entertainment. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s what to expect: &quot;During the protests, women will have the choice of going fully topless or wear red tape or something else to hide their nipples.&quot; You can also go fully dressed, but then it&apos;s just like <em>any other day</em>. And men: if you&apos;re going to go show your support, you are encouraged to wear a bikini top&#x2014;bikinis will be available on location.</p>

<p>And in case you need a reminder: yes, being topless in NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222334/http://gothamist.com/tags/topless">is completely legal</a>.</p>
