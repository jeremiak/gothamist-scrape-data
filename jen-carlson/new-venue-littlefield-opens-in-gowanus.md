</div></div>					<p>With every venue that shuts down in Manhattan, a new one seems to pop up in Gowanus! We first heard about Littlefield <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024092044/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/02/new_venue_alert_littlefield.php">last September</a>, and now the performance and art space is ready to open this Saturday, May 16th!  </p>

<p>From the looks of it, Julie Kim and Scott Koshnoodi (the duo behind the venue doors) have created a beautiful DIY space. We&apos;re told the 6200-square-foot warehouse space has plenty of eco-friendly elements, including: a landscaped interior courtyard, sound walls formed from recycled rubber tires, a bar constructed of salvaged bowling alley lanes, and energy supplied by wind-power. Future plans include incorporating a grey water system and a landscaped roof. Inside, a movable partition was built to separate the main live space from the bar and courtyard, this can be moved to accommodate larger crowds for performances if need be. All in all there&apos;s a 250 capacity, and they plan to host live performances, art installations and film screenings in the space.</p>

<p>If you&apos;d like to check out the space, and see more of Sergio Pizzo Barrele&apos;s art, head over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024092044/http://littlefieldnyc.com/">the soft opening</a> this Saturday (2 p.m. to 2 a.m.). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024092044/http://www.frictionnyc.com/">The Friction folk</a> will be helping Maria Porcaro with the booking, so look forward to spending some quality time down by the canal (here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024092044/http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=622+degraw+st+brooklyn,+ny&amp;sll=40.680963,-73.987062&amp;sspn=0.008185,0.017595&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.68028,-73.984208&amp;spn=0.008185,0.017595&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">map</a> to help you get there).</p>
