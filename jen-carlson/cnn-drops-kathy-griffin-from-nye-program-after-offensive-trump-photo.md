<p>On Tuesday, Kathy Griffin posted a video to Instagram showing her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/http://www.tmz.com/2017/05/30/kathy-griffin-beheads-donald-trump-photo-tyler-shields/">holding a prop of Donald Trump&apos;s bloody and severed head</a>. She explained the short clip was from a project she was working on with photographer Tyler Shields, who also posted photos from the shoot. A lot of people had feelings about this: </p>

<p>By nightfall, after receiving criticism from both the left and the right, Griffin deleted the video and posted a new one of her apologizing: &quot;I&apos;m a comic, I went way too far. The image is too disturbing... it wasn&apos;t funny, I get it. I beg for your forgiveness.&quot;</p>

<p>The criticism that followed the initial images being released included some from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/869887605558702080">Donald Trump Jr.</a>, who called it: &quot;disgusting but not surprising.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/https://twitter.com/ChelseaClinton/status/869660019016466432">Chelsea Clinton</a> also chimed in, stating the image was &quot;vile and wrong.&quot; And according to &quot;Trump family sources&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/http://www.tmz.com/2017/05/31/barron-trump-thought-donald-beheaded-image-real/">who spoke to TMZ</a>, Barron Trump allegedly saw the image flash on a television screen and thought it was real&#x2014;&quot;He&apos;s 11. He doesn&apos;t know who Kathy Griffin is and the head she was holding resembled his dad.&quot; Trump tweeted about his son&apos;s reaction, too: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!</p>&#x2014; Donald J.

<p>CNN was asked about its involvement with Griffin, who appears alongside Anderson Cooper annually on New Year&apos;s Eve, and on Wednesday afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/https://twitter.com/CNNPR/status/869965698969350144">they stated</a> that they &quot;terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year&apos;s Eve program.&quot; In a previous statement a CNN rep called the images &quot;disgusting and offensive.&quot;</p>

<p>They aren&apos;t the only ones distancing themselves from Griffin, Cooper said he was appalled: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.</p>&#x2014; Anderson Cooper (@andersoncooper) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/https://twitter.com/andersoncooper/status/869726823306887169">May 31, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>And Squatty Potty, who recently worked on an ad campaign with Griffin, dropped her as well, stating they were &quot;shocked and disappointed.&quot; CEO Bobby Edwards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/http://www.adweek.com/creativity/squatty-potty-drops-kathy-griffin-over-shock-photos-with-beheaded-trump/">told AdWeek</a>, &quot;In response, Squatty Potty has suspended its ad campaign featuring Ms. Griffin. We have acted swiftly and decisively to demonstrate our commitment to a culture of decency, civility and tolerance.&quot; </p>

<p>And the hits keep coming...</p>

<p>We&apos;ll see how Griffin weathers this negative press covfefe. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716204215/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/31/trump_climate_change_paris.php">Speaking of covfefe</a>, Trump is reportedly revoking the United States&apos; commitment to the Paris climate change agreement. </p>
