										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="0409aawa.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623165335im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/0409aawa.jpg" width="130" height="97" class="image-right"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623165335/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/01/woody_allen.php">Last year</a> Woody Allen filed a $10 million suit against American Apparel after they used his image (taken from <em>Annie Hall</em>) on their billboards in 2007, explaining at the time that he doesn&apos;t promote products in the U.S. This has now pit creepy underage-girl-loving Dov Charney against Allen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623165335/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soon-Yi_Previn">who clearly cannot relate</a> to anything remotely, um, unconventional. He is calling the company, amongst other things, &quot;sleazy, adolescent, and infantile,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623165335/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04082009/news/nationalnews/woody_rips_clothing_biz_163433.htm">the NY Post</a>. The tabloid also reports that yesterday American Apparel verbally retaliated &quot;by demanding records showing whether his &apos;highly publicized sex scandal and custody battle&apos; involving ex-girlfriend Mia Farrow and her adopted daughter Soon-Yi&#x2014;Woody&apos;s current wife&#x2014;had affected his earnings.&quot; Can there even be any winners in this case? (Besides Rupert Murdoch, of course.)</p>
