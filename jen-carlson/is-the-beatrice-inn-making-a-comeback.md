title: Is the Beatrice Inn Making a Comeback?

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="beatriceback1109.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182217im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/beatriceback1109.jpg" width="150" height="257" class="image-left"> </span>The Beatrice Inn shut down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182217/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/27/beatrice.php">earlier this year</a> after neighbors had enough of the A-list crowd partying it up at all hours. As the same war is being waged by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182217/http://gothamist.com/tags/nightmareonjanestreet">neighbors of the Jane Hotel</a>, against their late night ballroom antics, word is that the Beatrice may reopen. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182217/http://www.purple-diary.com/post/230199525/andre-in-front-of-the-soon-to-be-reopened-beatrice#idc-container">Purple Magazine</a>&apos;s Olivier Zahm, friend of Beatrice owner Paul Sevigny, posted a photo of someone in front of the shuttered club, saying it will soon be up and running once again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, someone who is working with Sevigny on getting his club back in business told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182217/http://gawker.com/5396719/the-smell-of-death-lingers-over-new-york-hipster-clubs">Gawker</a>, &quot;He&apos;s still fighting... <strong>But if it reopens, Beatrice won&apos;t be the same because of the neighbors, so that plan is to move the controversial party downtown to a space that does not have the same sound issues.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182217/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/24/nightlife_1.php">nightlife is being saved</a>, or at least relocated (until it&apos;s all turned into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182217/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/inside_the_limelight_mall.php">a mini mall</a>).</p>
