<p>Nothing goes better with a crisp, clear vodka than some rocks&#x2014;so why is one company trying to tarnish the alcohol with Jelly Belly-esque flavors? Van Gogh Vodka has been &quot;translating food flavor profiles into vibrant and authentically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612010121/http://vangoghvodka.com/van-gogh-our-vodkas/">flavored vodkas</a>&quot; for some time, and have just released their latest: the PB&amp;J; (if only we knew this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612010121/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/psa_monday_is_peanut_butter_jelly_d.php">on Monday</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612010121/http://www.barbizmag.com/component/content/article/22-booze-news/1999-Van-Gogh-PB?J-Vodka">BarBiz</a> notes:</p>

<blockquote>Van Gogh is proud to introduce their own take on the classic PB&amp;J;, transforming its timeless flavor into a delightfully smooth peanut butter and raspberry jelly flavored vodka. Master Distiller Tim Vos selected raspberry flavored jelly after taste-testing peanut butter sandwiches matched with various jellies. While the fragrance is predominately of peanuts, it is complimented by the fresh fruit aroma of the raspberry. On the tongue, the roles are reversed and the raspberry flavor is more of the focal point, giving it a velvety texture with a hint of vanilla on the side.</blockquote> 

<p>Their distiller says, &quot;It is fresh, fruity and mingles very well with the oily structure of the peanut butter.&quot; Speaking of &quot;oily,&quot; why not chase this bad boy with a shot of bacon grease? It&apos;s what Elvis would have done. [via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612010121/http://www.neatorama.com/2012/04/04/peanut-butter-and-jelly-vodka/">Neatorama</a>]</p>
