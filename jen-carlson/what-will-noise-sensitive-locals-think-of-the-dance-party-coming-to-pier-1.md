Last year some of the borough&apos;s locals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135730/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/20/brooklyn_heights_residents.php">rallied against</a> the Movies With A View series at Pier 1 in Brooklyn Bridge Park&#x2014;so if <em>Annie Hall</em> was too loud for them, they&apos;re going to be <em>just thrilled</em> to hear about the new Celebrate Brooklyn! Bridge Dance Party coming in May! (After all, these are also the same people who protested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135730/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/12/dumbo_locals_fight_carousel.php">a pretty carousel</a>!) The series will run for three consecutive Thursday nights starting at 7p.m., and will include deejays, performances, and even dance lessons. The lineup for the traditional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135730/http://gothamist.com/tags/celebratebrooklyn">Celebrate Brooklyn!</a> series, entering its 33rd season, will be announced at the first event.</p>

<ul><li>May 12th: Funk Dance Party with Maceo Parker and DJ Spinna
</li><li>May 19th: Tropical Dance Party with La Excelencia and Que Bajo?! Featuring Uproot Andy and Geko Jones
</li><li>May 26th: Bhangra Dance Party with Red Baraat and DJ Rekha</li></ul>

<p>Rev up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502135730/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/30/choppers.php">your helicopters</a>, aim them towards Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s Pier 1, and get ready to dance, dance, dance!</p>
