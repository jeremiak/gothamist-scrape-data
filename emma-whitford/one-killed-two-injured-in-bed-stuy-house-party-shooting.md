<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165935/http://nypost.com/2016/01/10/fatal-shooting-at-brooklyn-house-party/">The NY Post reports</a> that the shooter opened fire in the front hallway of the building, after being denied entry to a house party at the address. &quot;The whole party emptied out, and everyone went running for the door at once,&quot; one neighbor told the tabloid. </p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the victims were explicitly targeted by the shooter. </p>

<p>No arrests have been made as of Monday morning, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>
