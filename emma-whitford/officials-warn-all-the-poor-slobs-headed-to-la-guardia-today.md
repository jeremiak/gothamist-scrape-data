										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="021017_airport.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/021017_airport.jpg" width="640" height="459"> <br> <i> A scene from early February, 2017, somewhere near LGA (Courtesy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/https://twitter.com/sammdavison">@sammdavison</a>). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>The hangover from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/14/central_park_snow_day.php#photo-1">yesterday&apos;s non-blizzard</a> is rough. Commuters are penguin-shuffling along ice-crusted sidewalks, subway stations have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/https://twitter.com/fibosequence/status/841995054818447360">transformed</a> into slushy, sardine-packed saunas, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is attempting to get ahead of angry airport costumers with an all-caps message topping a cautionary press release: TRAVELERS URGED TO LEAVE PLENTY OF TIME AND HEAD TO LAGUARDIA AIRPORT <u>ONLY IF THEY HAVE CONFIRMED FLIGHTS</u>. </p>

<p>According to the authority, LaGuardia Airport is expected to bear the brunt of the pain/&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/lga_fml.php">vehicle traffic</a>,&quot; thanks to a combination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/24/first_go_to_jfk.php">construction-related detours</a> and rebooked flights. And today is just the beginning!</p>

<p>&quot;Following the severe winter storm that cancelled 99 percent of LaGuardia&#x2019;s 1,150 flights yesterday,&quot; the Port Authority warned in a statement, &quot;the airport is expecting significant vehicular traffic on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyone without a booked ticket is being urged not to bother, and those <em>with</em> tickets have been asked to double-check with airlines and leave &quot;plenty&quot; of time. Considering LGA&apos;s recent track record, &quot;plenty&quot; probably amounts to however long it takes you to drag your suitcase <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/10/lga_traffic_not_great_bob.php">through snow drifts</a> along the highway. </p>

<p>And no promises once you get there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/15/airports-snow-stranded-passengers/">1010Wins talked to one LaGuardia traveler</a> whose flight was canceled Tuesday, rebooked for Wednesday, then canceled again.</p>

<p>&quot;I just think it&apos;s ridiculous that they didn&apos;t notify us of any of this,&quot; the woman, Olivia, told the station. &quot;I am just trying not to scream right now and cry.&quot;</p>

<p>As an extra incentive to take public transit, the Q70 to LaGuardia is free through Friday. UberPool is also offering $10 flat fairs from LaGuardia to anywhere in the five boroughs. Optional taxi group rides will be departing from the terminals, as well. </p>

<p>This is not to say that Newark and John F. Kennedy Airport got off scot-free. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214906/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/15/airports-snow-stranded-passengers/">According to CBS</a>, close to 3,000 flights were canceled across the three airports on Tuesday. </p>
