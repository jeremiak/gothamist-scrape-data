<p>When Governor Cuomo suddenly decided to help fund the MTA&apos;s $26.1 billion capital plan in July&#x2014;after largely ignoring the MTA&apos;s budget needs throughout the last legislative session&#x2014;it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/29/mta_de_blasio_money.php">not immediately clear</a> where his grand, Mayor de Blasio-belittling $8.3 billion gesture would come from. </p>

<p>Questioning abated, though, when Cuomo, de Blasio and the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/at_last_cuomo_and_de_blasio_have_ag.php">triumphantly announced</a> their funding agreement on October 10th. &quot;Today, with agreement on the largest Capital Program ever committed to the future of the MTA, we take a giant step toward making sure that this one-of-a-kind jewel of a system will continue doing what it must,&quot; MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast said with feeling. </p>

<p>That blind (short-sighted?) joy didn&apos;t last long. Within weeks the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/28/subway_mta_second_ave.php">had announced</a> that $1 billion in funding would be cut from the second phase of the ever-elusive Second Avenue Subway line, in large part because the agency feared that the freshly-funded plan wouldn&apos;t go far enough. This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/de_blasio_2nd_ave_subay.php">did not go over well</a> with Mayor de Blasio, who had just agreed to contribute $2.5 billion to make the plan reality. </p>

<p>Tunnel boring for Phase II, which will serve 96th through 125th Streets, is now projected to start no sooner than 2019&#x2014;a timeline that East Harlem residents are not pleased about.</p>

<p>Upstate legislators, meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/19/mta-deal-upstate-roads-bridges/74234922/">soon balked</a> at the prospect of sending so many billions downstate&#x2014;unfamiliar with what it means to live and work along an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/20/obvious_confirmed.php">extremely crowded</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/mta_subway_report_card.php">breakdown-prone</a> public transit network, Republican Senators Thomas O&apos;Mara and Phil Palmesano demanded more funding for roads and bridges in the Finger Lakes Region. </p>

<p>&quot;If Governor Cuomo and legislative leaders are going to find billions of dollars for downstate mass transit in next year&#x2019;s state budget, we want to make sure that local roads, bridges and culverts across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions, and throughout the state, receive a fair share of state assistance,&quot; they said in a joint statement. </p>

<p>Even though the state&apos;s transit board has approved the Capital Plan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://www.amny.com/news/city-upstate-battle-over-funds-delays-mta-projects-1.11238391">AM New York reports</a> that the MTA has yet to submit it to the state&apos;s Capital Program Review Board, which will make final approvals. </p>

<p>&quot;In the normal process of bringing a Capital Program to the review board, they have a number of questions about its content and issues,&quot; MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast told reporters after yesterday&apos;s board meeting. &quot;Probably even more so this time given the size of the program. Second Avenue is a concern, and there&apos;s the issue that the legislation is concerned about funding for bridges and tunnels... those are issues we&apos;re sorting through.&quot; </p>

<p>While the &quot;sorting&quot; continues, ambitious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/east_side_access_photos.php#photo-1">East Side Access</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/when_will_penn_station_get_metro-no.php">Penn Station Access</a> projects remain a pipe dream, the L train is still <a href="L train gothamsit">threatening our jobs</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130204/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/31/upstate_secession_ny.php">this pocket of upstate secessionists</a> is not a joke. <br>
