<p>The New Yorkers who staff the city&apos;s museums and theaters, its zoos, botanical gardens, and dance companies, are majority white, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605070008/http://www.sr.ithaka.org/publications/diversity-in-the-new-york-city-department-of-cultural-affairs-community/#post-276381-footnote-9">a new survey</a> of non-profit cultural institutions that receive city funding conducted by the city&apos;s Cultural Affairs Department. </p>

<p>One survey respondent&#x2014;authors didn&apos;t specify gender or field&#x2014;spoke bluntly about why this might be. &quot;We operate on a shoestring budget, and have trouble paying competitive salaries,&quot; they said. &quot;As a result, job applicants are usually those who come from more privileged backgrounds and can afford to work for little money. This is our primary barrier to increasing staff diversity.&quot; We&apos;ll call it the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605070008/http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-interns-are-getting-younger-and-smarter-2015-6">Wall Street Intern</a> syndrome. </p>

<p>According to the study, NYC&apos;s cultural sector is 61.8% white overall, far outstripping any other minority group, despite the fact that NYC&apos;s population as a whole is only 33% white. </p>

<p>The disparities are stark in the details. For example, the vast majority of employees in leadership positions at cultural institutions are white. Study authors credited this, in part, to the large number of leadership roles at museums in the city&#x2014;museums made up one of the largest categories in the study. </p>

<p><strong>Leadership: </strong><br>

<p>And in the theater sector&#x2014;which is more than 75% white overall&#x2014;Hispanic, black and Asian employees are vastly outnumbered in categories from design and PR to development and programing. </p>

<p><strong>Theater: </strong><br>

<p>Andrea Louie, the executive director of the Asian American Arts Alliance, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605070008/http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-yorks-cultural-sector-far-less-diverse-city-itself/?hootPostID=525daa07a717a4c793b301f3ae7835c6">told WNYC</a> that many people of color are also at a disadvantage in management positions, because they come from a grassroots background, and don&apos;t have rolodexes bursting with wealthy potential donors. </p>

<p>&quot;Because we&apos;re not able to access deeper pockets, we become less attractive as potential candidates to perhaps those higher-level roles at larger institutions,&quot; she told the station (which, it&apos;s worth noting, also had to respond to the survey under the umbrella of National Public Radio). </p>

<p>The study also found that women outnumber men at all levels of the creative sector, filing 52% of junior positions, 53% of mid-level positions, and 54% of senior positions. But when it comes to board members, women only outnumber men in the dance sector. </p>
