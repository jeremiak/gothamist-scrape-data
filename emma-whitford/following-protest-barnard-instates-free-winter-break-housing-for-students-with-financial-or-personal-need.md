<p>Following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164403/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/16/no_winter_housing_barnard.php">weeks of petitioning and flyering</a> on behalf of low-income, homeless and housing-insecure Barnard College undergraduates, College President Debora Spar sent an e-mail to the Barnard community on Monday night reinstating winter break housing for students with demonstrable &quot;financial or personal&quot; need. </p>

<p>From December 24th to January 16th, low-income students with proven need will also be invited to stay on campus free of charge. </p>

<p>&quot;This is a VICTORY,&quot; said the Barnard College Student Coalition for Financially Insecure Students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164403/https://www.change.org/p/barnard-college-provide-safe-subsidized-winter-housing-to-housing-insecure-barnard-students/u/14322150">in a statement</a>. &quot;The administration is reversing course, and is offering a paper application to those really in need of housing.&quot; </p>

<p>The application is due by November 30th. As per the President&apos;s e-mail, &quot;With the application, and any supporting documentation, we can determine how best to allocate available housing.&quot; </p>

<p>Only &quot;mission critical&quot; students like varsity athletes and tour guides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160326164403/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/16/no_winter_housing_barnard.php">were initially invited to remain in dorms</a> this winter. International students, homeless students, those who would like to stay on campus for a short-term internship or for any other &quot;individual personal reasons&quot; like unsafe conditions at home were asked to seek alternative housing. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the administration cited the school&apos;s financial issues as a factor in reducing winter housing, as well as construction on campus, and limited campus resources over winter break.</p>

<p>Barnard, a women&apos;s college affiliated with Columbia, has long had a strict winter-break policy, charging some students $400 to stay in their dorms for the month-long break between Fall and Spring semesters. At neighboring Columbia, students are allowed free access to their dorms throughout winter break.</p>

<p>&quot;We were dismayed by recent allegations that the College was turning away students facing homelessness, or those dealing with dangerous situations at home,&quot; said Spar in her Monday e-mail. &quot;We always have, and always will, make accommodation for those students who, for personal or financial reasons, cannot return home.&quot; </p>

<p>Toni Airaksinen, a 19-year-old sophomore from Cleveland, rejected this statement, citing the mission-critical requirement. &quot;Barnard is trying to make it seem like they didn&apos;t actually eliminate winter housing for those in need,&quot; she said. &quot;They completely did.&quot; </p>

<p>However, she is pleased that the e-mail referenced homeless, low-income and first-generation students explicitly, and vowed to serve their needs. </p>

<p>Last week, a Junior Sociology student who is legally emancipated from her parents told us that, for her, &quot;Essentially, it&apos;s not a plan or choice to stay here, it&apos;s the only option.&quot; </p>

<p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, she went on to condemn the school&apos;s demonstrated attitude towards low-income students. &quot;Barnard positions itself as a bastion of postmodern feminism and social awareness,&quot; she said. &quot;They hide behind this image.... Low income kids like myself are more than a brochure statistic.&quot;</p>

<p>Last week, the administration confirmed that it was making efforts to address the needs of impacted students, before the official reinstatement of winter housing. &quot;Approximately a dozen students have reached out for help,&quot; a spokeswoman said. As of today, 8 students have been approved for winter housing. The application deadline is Monday. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Barnard spokeswoman Anna O&apos;Sullivan issued the following statement: &quot;The main purpose of the President&#x2019;s notification to all students was to alert them of the procedure change&#x2014;from in-person meetings to an application (as was the procedure last year), and to make note of the fees being waived.&quot; </p>
