					<p>A water main break on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights has turned the R train platform at Court Street into a muddy, brown swamp, according to the MTA. It doesn&apos;t look pretty folks, and apparently it doesn&apos;t smell great either. </p>

<p>The break was reported at 3:15 p.m. and is ongoing, according to an FDNY spokesman. Firefighters responded to 156 Montague Street between Clinton and Henry Streets earlier this afternoon, and are still on the scene. </p>

<p>MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said that R trains are being rerouted over the Manhattan Bridge. </p>
