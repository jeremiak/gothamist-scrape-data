<p>A Deputy Police Chief from Middletown, New Jersey hosted a rally honoring local law enforcement on Friday that he said was intended to send a message to professional athletes like San Francisco 49ers quarterback <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/https://twitter.com/Kaepernick7">Colin Kaepernick</a>, who has recently refused to stand during pre-game performances of the national anthem in a show of solidarity with victims of police brutality. Kaepernick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem">has said</a> he won&apos;t stand up &quot;to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color&quot; while &quot;there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s OK to stand up for social justice, inequality and reform,&quot; Deputy Chief Stephen Dollinger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://www.app.com/story/news/local/how-we-live/race/2016/10/19/middletown-nj-police-rally/91939756/">told the Asbury Park Press last week</a>. &quot;It&apos;s another thing to not stand up for the national anthem.&quot;</p>

<p>Dollinger&apos;s so-called &quot;Salute to the USA&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2016/10/aclu_takes_issue_with_law_enforcement_ceremony_bef.html">took place</a> before a highly-anticipated High School football game on Friday night, between Jersey Shore rivals Middletown South and Toms River North. Hundreds of officers from across the state took to the field for a bagpipe procession, and unfolded a massive American flag with the help of both teams. Linden Police Officer Angel Padilla, who was injured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/de_blasio_bomb_arrest.php">while apprehending</a> alleged Chelsea bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi, received an award. </p>

<p>&quot;I wanted to show that pro athletes are supposed to be role models, but in this case the athletes&#x2014;the high school athletes&#x2014;are going to be setting the example. It&apos;s going to be kind of a role reversal,&quot; Dollinger said ahead of the event. </p>

<p>In response to Dollinger&apos;s comments, the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union accused local police of setting out to silence dissenting voices. </p>

<p>&quot;The police have a duty to defend the rights of protesters, not to use such a large-scale display of force that effectively silences people with differing viewpoints,&quot; said ACLU-NJ Policy Counsel Dianna Houenou in a statement. </p>

<p>&quot;The statements made by the deputy police chief and the event&apos;s ostentatious show of power send an ominous, frightening message,&quot; added ACLU organizer Jasmine Crenshaw. &quot;That, as an official stance, law enforcement will not tolerate expressions acknowledging our nation&#x2019;s history of unequal treatment and systematic oppression.&quot;</p>

<p>In a letter to school officials ahead of the rally [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/https://www.aclu-nj.org/files/7814/7708/3930/2016.10.21_Letter_re_Middletown_South_Rally.pdf">PDF</a>], the ACLU, Greater Long Branch NAACP, and National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives urged both schools to keep in mind their students&apos; First Amendment right to &quot;kneel, sit or stand&quot; during the national anthem. </p>

<p>In his introductory remarks on Friday night, Dollinger called the salute &quot;an exhibition of respect, as our two communities come together to celebrate our country, law enforcement, the military, and first responders that help keep us safe.&quot; </p>

<p>Dollinger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://www.app.com/story/news/local/emergencies/2016/10/21/patriotic-celebration-before-game-week-middletown/92524572/">later told reporters</a> that his comments about Kaepernick had been &quot;twisted.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This [event] wasn&apos;t closed to anybody,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody was welcome to come here. So I don&apos;t know where that got skewed. The ACLU can come here. This is just about honoring our country and the men and women of law enforcement and first responders. That&apos;s all this is about.&quot; </p>

<p>In a show of solidarity with Kaepernick, high school football teams across the country have taken a knee this fall: in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://highschoolsports.nj.com/news/article/1521599601220145276/woodrow-wilson-football-players-and-coaches-kneel-for-national-anthem/#incart_river_home">Camden, New Jersey</a>, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/recruiting-insider/wp/2016/09/10/watkins-mill-football-team-kneels-during-national-anthem-before-game/">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://wjhl.com/2016/09/11/norfolk-va-high-school-football-players-refuse-to-stand-during-national-anthem/">Virginia</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028211715/http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/10/high-school-football-players-across-country-take-knee-national-anthem">Texas</a>. </p>
