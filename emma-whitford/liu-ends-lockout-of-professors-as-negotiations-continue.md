<p>About 400 unionized Long Island University Brooklyn professors returned to work on Thursday morning, following news late Wednesday that their union, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125915/http://www.liuff.net/">Long Island University Faculty Federation (LIUFF)</a>, had negotiated an extension on contract negotiations through May of next year. LIU agreed to let the professors back on campus, ending a week of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125915/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/13/liu_lockout_students_psychology.php">classroom walkouts and protests</a>. </p>

<p>Professors said they were surprised, as they&apos;d been under the impression that negotiations were moving slowly up until yesterday. </p>

<p>&quot;I think we all kind of stumbled into work this morning, kind of confused and disoriented,&quot; said Kevin Meehan, an associate psychology professor. &quot;None of us were expecting to be here today.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There are some misgivings about how things transpired, and probably some kind of repair that&apos;s going to need to happen between us and the administration,&quot; he added. &quot;But for today we&apos;re trying to get things back to normal for the students.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;People are extra-attentive in class today,&#x201D; said Stephanie Fermin, 24, a graduate student studying speech therapy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like you don&#x2019;t know what you have until admin lock them out.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125915/http://www.aft.org/">American Federation of Teachers</a>, LIUFF&apos;s national affiliate, confirmed the news in a statement Wednesday. &quot;The battle, which extends the faculty&apos;s expired contract to May 31, 2017, was a hard-fought win for the staff and students they serve,&quot; they said. &quot;The agreement will immediately return students and faculty to their classrooms.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the AFT, professors will be reimbursed for any healthcare costs incurred during the 12-day lockout. The union will not drop unfair labor practice complaints it filed last week. </p>

<p>Over Labor Day weekend, LIU&apos;s union faculty members were informed that they would not be welcome on campus until an agreement was reached on their five-year contract, which expired on August 31st. Their health insurance was suspended, and they were locked out of their e-mail accounts.</p>

<p>Interim teachers were recruited from other schools. While LIU described these professors as &quot;adjuncts with advanced degrees,&quot; students said some were teaching assistants, and many didn&apos;t seem qualified. Some classes were combined into large sections, students said, while others had no-show professors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125915/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/08/liu_lockout_walk_out.php">Labs were canceled</a>, and campus services <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125915/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/13/liu_lockout_students_psychology.php">including the mental health counseling center</a> went unstaffed. </p>

<p>One of LIUFF&apos;s goals for the new contract is to secure higher starting wages for professors, equal to those at LIU&apos;s C.W. Post campus in Nassau County. Brooklyn professors say their campus, which serves more black, Latino and low-income students than C.W. Post, is undervalued by the administration. Tuition is the same at both campuses&#x2014;$34,352 per year, not including room and board. </p>

<p>Teachers also maintain that the contract should include higher base-pay for adjunct professors, who typically have fewer benefits, lower salaries, and less of a say in their teaching schedules than full-time staff.</p>

<p>The LIU administration said last week that the lockout was in the students&apos; best interest, based on the union&apos;s historical willingness to strike. In May, the union voted in favor of possibly striking if negotiations went south, though a lawyer for the union <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125915/http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=50913X1248263&amp;site=gothamist.com&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F09%2F07%2Fnyregion%2Fliu-brooklyn-locks-out-professors-amid-contract-dispute.html%3F_r%3D0&amp;xguid=466028a8db189e37cb4930d4f7c636eb&amp;xuuid=b3736d0870beb2dcca87b69401fc8e0c&amp;xsessid=de5875069535532b8c281cbd4f6188a8&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2F2016%2F09%2F07%2Fliu_brooklyn_lockout.php&amp;pref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;xtz=240">told the NY Times</a> that the move is standard&#x2014;&quot;something to have in our back pocket.&quot; During 2011 contract negotiations, LIU professors went on strike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125915/http://www.psc-cuny.org/clarion/september-2011/faculty-strike-wins-imperfect-victory-liu">for several days</a> before the contract was settled.</p>

<p>The administration emphasized on Thursday that the contract extension bars the union from striking through the end of May. &quot;As part of the extension of the collective bargaining agreement, the union has agreed not to strike, which guarantees students continuity of instruction and certainty that the academic year will not be interrupted,&quot; President Kimberly Cline wrote in an e-mail to students. </p>

<p>&quot;The union&apos;s commitment not to strike during this academic year provides us enough runway to reach a reasonable and fair agreement, while providing our students the ability to continue their studies uninterrupted,&quot; said LIU Vice President Gale Haynes in a statement. </p>

<p>The AFT said Thursday that the no-strike clause was already written into the contract, and is therefore not a new concession. </p>

<p>Professors are currently sitting in on a meeting to discuss last night&apos;s negotiations. We&apos;ll update with any additional information. </p>
