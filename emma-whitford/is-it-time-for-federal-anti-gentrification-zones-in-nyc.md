<p>The federal government should establish neighborhood anti-gentrification zones where vulnerable tenants could form cooperatives to purchase their apartment buildings away from predatory landlords, according to a policy report revealed today by Democratic State Senator Adriano Espaillat. </p>

<p>Increasing cooperative ownership in NYC would ideally save some buildings from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/22/pioneering_brooklyn_east_ny.php">ruthless market</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Some people say, &apos;Well, you can&apos;t fight the market forces,&apos;&quot; Espaillat told Gothamist this week. &quot;I&apos;m saying let&apos;s get ahead of the market forces and assist neighborhoods so that some level of security is reached. So gentrification doesn&apos;t just come in full-blow.&quot; </p>

<p>If a landlord within a so-called Gentrification Mitigation Zone (GMZ) put an apartment building on the market, his tenants would have right of first refusal to purchase that building as a cooperative. Funding for the purchase would come in the form of mortgage loans financed by the federal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://www.hudhomesusa.org/welcome.html?adid=HHU294000&amp;XID=20160222&amp;AFID=hud%20home%20for%20sale_b&amp;utm_id=HHU_Bing">Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)</a>.</p>

<p>Espaillat&apos;s focus would be historically working-class neighborhoods with significant immigrant populations. He has suggested a pilot project in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/08/rents_in_harlem_are_90_damn_percent.php">East Harlem</a>, adding that he&apos;d also focus on neighborhoods where a high percentage of residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://ibo.nyc.ny.us/cgi-park2/?cat=18">pay preferential rents</a>, like Flushing and Astoria in Queens. </p>

<p>Dropped in the final weeks of a heated Congressional race&#x2014;Espaillat&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/nyregion/contest-to-fill-rangels-seat-its-old-vs-new.html?_r=0">vying to replace</a> retiring Harlem congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/tags/charlesrangel">Charles Rangel</a>&#x2014;the policy would require a major about-face from the feds, whose traditional contributions to affordable housing have been drying up for years. Federal Section 8 rental vouchers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/section-8/applicants.page">have been closed to NYC applicants since 2009</a>, and NYCHA has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/nycha_deblasio_protest.php">turned to private developers</a> to fund its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/17/nycha_broke.php">desperately-needed repairs</a>. Traditionally, the federal government hasn&apos;t delved into local land use policy. </p>

<p>&quot;At the federal level, which is really where the money is, there is no discussion whatsoever about this particular issue,&quot; Espaillat added. &quot;There has to be a reassessment of funding in general. HUD has pretty much become an absentee landlord if you may, and abandoned housing as a real issue.&quot; </p>

<p>Espaillat also envisions a small tax, perhaps 1% of the sales price, on any building sold within a GMZ (assuming the residents are unable to rally around a purchase). That money would be distributed to any displaced tenants to aid in their relocation. </p>

<p>Developers looking to build within GMZs would be required to present their plans to local politicians in the form of a Community Impact Statement, and hold a public feedback session for any new residential building with 10 or more units. </p>

<p>Some of these concepts are familiar. An early-1990s federal preservation program called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/https://nhlp.org/node/955">Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act (LIHPRHA)</a> provided federal funding to nonprofit organizations and tenant groups to purchase their buildings, before Congress defunded it in 1998. In Washington DC, building owners are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/06/16/d-c-landlords-tenants-know-topa/">required</a> to give their tenants the right of first refusal.</p>

<p>But while advocates, academics and attorneys were pleasantly surprised to see a pitch for anti-gentrification policy at the federal level, several worried that the cost of the GMZ program would be staggering&#x2014;especially for a federal government so historically stingy when it comes to affordable housing. </p>

<p>&quot;With LIHPRHA they had to layer all kinds of subsidies to make it actually affordable,&quot; John Krinsky, a professor of political science at City College, told us. &quot;It was more feasible in situations where there wasn&apos;t yet rampant gentrification, because those properties aren&apos;t as valuable yet.&quot; </p>

<p>Even East New York, still less gentrified than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/08/crown_heights_family_cant_escape_of.php">neighboring Crown Heights</a>, recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/29/east_new_york_real_estate_got_expen.php">saw its property values triple</a>. &quot;Think about a tenant coop that is competing for a property with, like, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/stuy_town_affordable_housing.php">Blackstone Group</a>,&quot; Krinsky speculated.  </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s hard to see how the Republican Congress is going to pass any of these,&quot; added Legal Aid Society housing attorney Judith Goldiner. &quot;Truthfully, it&apos;s just so hard to get them to do anything.&quot; She suggested that if the federal government were willing to make a huge investment in affordable housing, the money might be better spent on fully funding Section 8, coupled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/cuomo_rent_albany_samo.php">stronger rent laws</a> at the state level and the right to an attorney in housing court. </p>

<p>She also questioned Espaillat&apos;s relocation tax proposal. &quot;Once people are displaced it&apos;s really hard to find them,&quot; she said. &quot;And they&apos;re probably going to be paying more somewhere else. That&apos;s not the goal.&quot; </p>

<p>Governmental loans, like the HUD-funded mortgages Espaillat is suggesting, tend to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_research_081712.html">expiration dates</a>. What might happen to cooperative tenants if and when these federal subsidies run dry? </p>

<p>&quot;When you have these HUD-backed loans, the object is how do you keep them from [expiring] after a certain amount of time,&quot; Krinsky said, suggesting that Espaillat consider the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/09/nyc_affordable_housing_vacancy.php">Community Land Trust (CLT) model</a>&#x2014;which can protect a building from any future for-profit sale&#x2014;as an additional protection. (Espaillat says he&apos;s open to the concept.) </p>

<p>But even with the protections of a CLT, some advocates in Espaillat&apos;s Harlem are skeptical of the sustainability of the proposed coops.  </p>

<p>Maria Lizardo, director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032835/http://www.nmic.org/">Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation (NMIC)</a>, has supported numerous low-income coops in Harlem. &quot;It only works when you are able to provide the tenants with a lot of assistance,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything from the workshops about what to expect... to doing the monthly overview of the budget and maintenance increases.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;These ideas are great, but not without ongoing support,&quot; added NMIC legal services head Rodrigo Sanchez. &quot;It&apos;s something that needs to be seen as an ongoing 10, 20, 30-year plan. Whether I think the government will commit to the dollars and cents is another question.&quot;  </p>
