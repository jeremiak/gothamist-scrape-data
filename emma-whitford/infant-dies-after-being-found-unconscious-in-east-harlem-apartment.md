<p>A four-month-old infant died on Thursday night after being discovered unconscious inside an East Harlem apartment, according to the NYPD. A spokeswoman for the department said that the person who discovered the infant &quot;provides care for the child,&quot; and may have been operating a day care facility out of the apartment. Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172642/http://pix11.com/2016/08/19/police-4-month-old-boy-found-dead-in-east-harlem-home/">told Pix11</a> that the day care may not have been properly licensed. </p>

<p>Police responded to a call of an unconscious infant inside apartment #4H at 1662 Park Avenue near the corner of East 117th Street shortly after 5:00 p.m. on Thursday. There they discovered the infant, Ady Seck of East Harlem, unresponsive. EMS transported Seck to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>The boy reportedly had no visible injuries. The medical examiner will determine cause of death. </p>

<p>The address where Seck was found is next door to the offices of Manhattan&apos;s Community Board 11. Reached for comment, a member of the CB declined to provide her name, but said that no one in her office had any knowledge of a day care facility on the block. </p>

<p>&quot;There are no storefront day cares on this block that we know of,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not happening inside of an apartment.&quot; The only storefronts on the block are a notary, and a tapas restaurant. </p>

<p>Of the nearly 11,300 day care facilities in NYC, only 2,272 of them are licensed by the city. The rest are state-licensed, and are required by law to conspicuously post any violations. </p>
