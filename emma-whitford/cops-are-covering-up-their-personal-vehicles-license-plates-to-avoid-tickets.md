<p>Ask your average <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151506/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bike_lanes_brooklyn.php">disgruntled Jay Street bike commuter</a>, and they&apos;ll likely have a story or two about recent encounters with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151506/https://twitter.com/placardabuse">placard corruption</a>&#x2014;when city workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151506/https://twitter.com/BrandonWC/status/709915597887381504">take advantage</a> of their right to park in no-parking zones, bike lanes included. The phenomenon, tirelessly documented by Twitter user <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151506/https://twitter.com/placardabuse">@placardabuse</a>, shows cops don&apos;t need a cover to enjoy roadway privileges. This week, though, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151506/http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/21534-some-law-enforcement-officers-are-using-plastic-covers-to-obscure-their-license-plates-investigation-finds">Inside Edition investigation</a> found that some cops are going to greater lengths to skirt traffic rules. The outlet discovered more than 100 NYPD officer-owned vehicles parked around the city with illegal plastic license plate covers. </p>

<p>The subtle covers don&apos;t obscure the plate at eye level, but obscure it completely at an angle. Speeding and toll cameras only capture a blur. Most were found parked around 1 Police Plaza, with others parked around precinct headquarters and courthouses.</p>

<p>Inside Edition reporter Lisa Guerrero confronted numerous cops in the course of her reporting. In one case, she compelled an officer to right his wrong: </p>

<blockquote>Guerrero saw one car with obscured front and rear plates and a placard on the dashboard showing the owner was with the New York City Police Department. She waited for him to return and approached him as he neared his car.

<p>&quot;Is this your car?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you tell me why you have illegal cover on your license plate?&quot; she asked, but he turned away.</p>

<p>He said he would remove the plate covers so Guerrero offered him a screwdriver and he took them off in front of our cameras.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Responding to the allegations, NYPD brass admitted that the plastic covers are a known internal issue. While the department didn&apos;t immediately respond to our request for comment, spokesman J. Peter Donald told Inside Edition that, &quot;This is an issue the Department has been aware of and is working to address.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Department has instructed precinct commanders to ensure officers in their commands are complying with traffic laws and internal guidelines on license plate covers,&quot; he added. &quot;Just this week, there were several spot inspections in lower Manhattan to ensure personal vehicles of police officers are following traffic laws.&quot;</p>

<p>Beyond fines, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151506/http://nypost.com/2017/02/09/nypd-cops-are-using-illegal-license-plate-covers-to-thwart-traffic-cameras/">the NY Post reports</a>, offending officers could face docked vacation days. </p>
