<p>Pop star and glitter enthusiast Kesha (full name Kesha Rose Sebert) reportedly broke down in tears in Manhattan Supreme Court on Friday, after a judge denied her plea to temporarily break an exclusive contract with Sony producer Lukasz Gottwald (a.k.a. Dr. Luke), a man she alleges sexually abused her for years.</p>

<p>Kesha, 28, first filed suit against Dr. Luke in the fall of 2014, claiming sexual abuse. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160752/http://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiarosenbaum/kesha-dr-luke-contract-ruling?bftw&amp;utm_term=.se0aEmwmlJ#.xpGV6y9yz1">Buzzfeed reports</a> that Kesha filed claims detailing how Dr. Luke allegedly abused her physically, forced her to take drugs, and drove her into an eating disorder by consistently shaming her weight. Dr. Luke sued Kesha the following summer in New York, claiming defamation and breach of contract. A month later, Kesha countersued, detailing how Dr. Luke convinced her to leave home when she was 18 to pursue a career, and proceeded to abuse her physically and emotionally for a decade. She has also accused the producer of raping her shortly after her 18th birthday. </p>

<p>&quot;I cannot work with this monster,&quot; Kesha <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160752/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/kesha-asks-judge-injunction-dr-luke-court-battle-article-1.2370328">wrote in an affidavit filed last fall</a>. &quot;So I beg of you to please consider letting me put out my music without me having to work with him, please.&quot; </p>

<p>Under the Sony contract, Kesha is obligated to make six more albums with Dr. Luke. </p>

<p>Today&apos;s court appearance addressed Kesha&apos;s formal plea for a temporary break from her Sony contract, at least until her ongoing legal battle with Dr. Luke is resolved. According to Kesha&apos;s attorneys, their client is effectively stuck&#x2014;unable to be in the company of, much less work with, a man who abused her. Thanks to the binding Sony contract, she&apos;s unable to make new music until, worst case scenario, her career is shot. </p>

<p>Gottwald&apos;s attorney Christine Lepera countered in a statement that, &#x201C;It was Kesha who chose to file a lawsuit falsely alleging abuse to gain advantage in contract negotiations, and now she must accept the consequences of her improper actions.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Judge Shirley Kornreich on Friday ruled to uphold Sony&apos;s contract. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re asking the court to decimate a contract that was heavily negotiated and typical for the industry,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160752/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/19/kesha-still-chained-to-dr-luke.html?via=desktop&amp;source=twitter">told Kesha&apos;s team on Friday</a>, adding, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t understand why I have to take the extraordinary measure of granting an injunction.&quot; </p>

<p>Sony reportedly stated on Friday that Kesha could work under another producer at Sony for the duration of her contract. But her attorney Mark Geragos dismissed the claim as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160752/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/kesha-sobs-judge-denies-sony-records-injunction-request-article-1.2537490">illusory</a>,&quot; charging that Sony wouldn&apos;t promote the albums, as the company holds Dr. Luke&apos;s interests paramount. The judge countered that Garagos was being &quot;speculative.&quot; </p>

A separate ruling on the sexual abuse claims might come <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160752/http://pagesix.com/2016/02/19/kesha-forced-to-keep-recording-with-dr-luke-judge-rules/">as soon as next week</a>. </p>

<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160752/http://www.thepetitionsite.com/646/007/918/">online petition</a> calling on Sony to free Kesha from her contractual obligation with Dr. Luke has more than 120,000 supporters as of this writing, and many Kesha fans gathered outside of the courthouse on Friday afternoon. </p>

<p>&#x201C;This is not just for me. This is for every woman, every human who has ever been abused. Sexually. Emotionally. Mentally. I had to tell the truth,&#x201D; Kesha wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160752/https://www.instagram.com/p/BB6C2mUO1Ze/?taken-by=iiswhoiis">in an Instagram post</a> on Thursday. &#x201C;So the outcome will be what it will be. There&#x2019;s nothing left I can do.&quot; </p>
