<p>An off-duty correction officer was arrested early Sunday morning after he smashed several pipes and punched a window inside a hookah bar in Sunset Park, according to the NYPD. Palmenio Reyes, 33, was &quot;probably intoxicated&quot; an NYPD spokesman said. He&apos;s been preliminarily charged with criminal mischief. </p>

<p>Reyes was arrested around 5:00 a.m. on Sunday at Floridita, a hookah bar and Puerto Rican restaurant at 4523 5th Avenue on the corner of 46th Street. According to police, Reyes &quot;broke a few of the hookahs&quot; and then punched a window on his way out, cutting his left wrist. It wasn&apos;t immediately clear what prompted the smashing spree. </p>
