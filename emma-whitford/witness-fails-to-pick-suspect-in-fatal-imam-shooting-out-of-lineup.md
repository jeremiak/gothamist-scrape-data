---

	
										<p>A witness to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/13/imam_and_assistant_shot_in_queens_i.php">fatal shooting of an imam and his assistant</a> in Queens over the weekend failed to identify 35-year-old suspect Oscar Morel in a line-up on Monday, according to a spokesperson for the Queens District Attorney&apos;s office.  </p>

<p>Queens District Attorney Kevin McCormack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160818/kew-gardens/witness-fails-identify-suspect-lineup-for-imam-killing-da-says">confirmed the line-up results</a> in court on Thursday. On Tuesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/16/queens_imam_shooter.php">Morel was charged</a> with one count of first degree murder, two counts of second degree murder, and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon. </p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://www.queensda.org/newpressreleases/2016/AUGUST%202016/morel_08_16_2016_arr_update.pdf">PDF</a>], Morel shot both victims with a revolver multiple times, including in the backs of their heads. The complaint cites video surveillance and &quot;admissions by the defendant&quot; as evidence. </p>

<p>&quot;We have the gun; we have video,&quot; NYPD Chief Robert Boyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/nyregion/queens-imam-oscar-morel.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;_r=0">told reporters on Wednesday</a>. &quot;Clearly, it is him.&quot; </p>

<p>Disputing this conclusion, Morel&apos;s family came to support him in court on Thursday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/nyregion/family-of-man-charged-in-killing-of-queens-imam-insists-he-is-innocent.html">According to the NY Times</a>, they filled most of one long court bench and called out, &quot;Love you, Oscar,&quot; even as the judge reprimanded them. While they declined to speak with reporters, Morel&apos;s father, who was helped out of the courtroom by two relatives, was heard saying, &quot;He don&#x2019;t do it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Imam Maulama Akonjee, 55, and his assistant Thara Uddin, 64, were walking from the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid mosque on Saturday afternoon when a man approached them from behind and shot them both in the head. The suspect then got into a car, which the police determined was a Chevy Trailblazer.</p>

<p>Shortly after the shooting, a Trailblazer driver struck a cyclist while making a U-turn in Brooklyn. The cyclist took the license plate number down and reported it to police, who in turn tracked the car to Miller Avenue in Brooklyn. Police say that Morel got into the car and attempted to flee. He &quot;rammed the detectives&#x2019; car several times&quot; before he was arrested, according to Boyce. Police reportedly found the revolver used in the shooting &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/nyregion/oscar-morel-queens-imam-shootings.html?_r=0">in the wall</a>&quot; of Morel&apos;s basement apartment.</p>

<p>Morel, who held a maintenance job at the New School at the time of his arrest, lived in Ozone Park before moving to his current East New York address. </p>

<p>In the week following the shooting, many in the Muslim community have urged the DA&apos;s office to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/queens_muslim_murdered.php#photo-1">charge Morel with a hate crime</a>, in addition to the murder charges. </p>

<p>&quot;While the motivation for this violent act is still unclear and continues to be investigated, one of the possible motives being explored is whether this was a hate crime,&quot; stated Queens District Attorney Richard Brown on Tuesday. &quot;Crimes motivated by bias or hate are deplorable and can never be tolerated. Regardless, however, whether a hate crime was committed in this case, the crime will be vigorously prosecuted and we will seek the most serious penalties that our law allows.&quot; </p>

<p>NYPD brass said Wednesday that they had not uncovered any evidence that Morel had a history of animosity towards Muslims or Bangladeshis. Boyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/nyregion/queens-imam-oscar-morel.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;_r=0">added</a> that searches of his cell phone had &quot;revealed nothing&quot; so far. </p>

<p>Members of the Muslim community have pointed out that both men were wearing traditional religious clothing when they were shot. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t see how it&apos;s a hate crime. Number 1, the defendant says he didn&apos;t do it,&quot; Morel&apos;s attorney Michael Schwed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025144324/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160818/kew-gardens/witness-fails-identify-suspect-lineup-for-imam-killing-da-says">told reporters outside court</a>. &quot;As far as he&apos;s concerned, he didn&apos;t commit any crime.&quot;</p>

<p>Morel&apos;s case is scheduled to go to grand jury today. </p>
