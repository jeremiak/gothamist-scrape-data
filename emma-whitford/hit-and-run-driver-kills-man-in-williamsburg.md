<p>A driver struck and killed an elderly man attempting to cross Grand Street in Williamsburg this afternoon, according to the NYPD. The unidentified driver fled the scene behind the wheel of a white box truck, adding to a handful of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180559/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/01/queens_fatal_hit_and_run.php">fatal</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180559/http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/01/03/brutal-holiday-season-on-nyc-streets-drivers-killed-6-pedestrians-in-8-days/">hit-and-run</a> crashes in New York City since December. </p>

<p>The 85-year-old pedestrian, whose name has not been released, was struck in front of 584 Grand Street near the corner of Lorimer Street shortly after 1:00 p.m., according to police. An NYPD spokesman could not confirm whether the man was crossing the street in a crosswalk, or with a walk signal. He succumbed to his injuries at Bellevue Hospital. </p>

<p>No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>Safe Streets advocates are calling for the Department of Transportation to study possible pedestrian and cyclist improvements on Grand Street, which saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180559/http://www.visionzeroview.nyc/">dozens of injuries and two fatalities last year</a>. Matthew von Ohlen, an avid cyclist, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180559/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/03/cyclist_killed_by_hit-and-run_drive.php">struck and killed</a> by a hit-and-run driver a few blocks away from today&apos;s crash last summer. Specifically, the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives is calling for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180559/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/02/grand_street_l_train_mta.php">Grand Street Peopleway</a>, arguing that surface traffic will only increase on the lead-up to the Williamsburg Bridge with the impending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180559/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/25/talkin_l_train_shutdown_blues.php">L Train shutdown</a>. </p>

<p>In response to the recent cluster of hit-and-run deaths, Manhattan Councilmember Ydanis Rodriguez introduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180559/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/hit_run_reward_nyc.php">legislation</a> last week that would create a hit-and-run reward fund of up to $1,000 per tip. But advocates say stronger measures must be taken, at the state level. Currently, the maximum penalty for a DWI exceeds that for a hit-and-run&#x2014;a discrepancy they say motivates drivers to flee. </p>

<p>Under current law, it is a C felony to kill someone while driving under the influence, but only a D felony to leave the scene of a fatal crash.</p>
