<p>Four officers from the Brooklyn North Warrant Squad were actively searching for Shipman around 8:45 a.m. Tuesday morning, according to the NYPD, when they saw his car parked along the curb on Vernon Avenue between Tompkins and Marcy Avenues. Two of the officers approached on foot, while the others drove an unmarked department van in front of Shipman&apos;s car, cutting him off. As one of the cops approached Shipman&apos;s window, the NYPD said that Shipman &quot;accelerated and mounted the sidewalk in the direction of the detective.&quot; </p>

<p>Another officer, in plainclothes, fired one round at Shipman &quot;as he was driving forward,&quot; striking his left shoulder. Shipman then drove directly into the wall of Public School 23&#x2014;the school was placed on a temporary lockdown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160930020058/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/27/bedford-stuyvesant-brooklyn-police-shooting/">according to CBS</a>&#x2014;and continued towards Marcy Avenue. Shipman was eventually taken into custody near the intersection of Tompkins and Gates Avenues, and transported to Methodist Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160930020058/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/cops-arresting-man-brooklyn-shoot-arm-article-1.2808349?%2F%3F%2F">the Daily News</a>, the police angled their SUV to pin Shipman&apos;s car just before his arrest, and eventually broke one of his car windows to extract him.  </p>

<p>&quot;It looked like he [Shipman] got stuck in there and they wouldn&apos;t let him get out,&quot; one witness told the tabloid. &quot;They [the police] didn&apos;t get out of their car until they had back up [sic].&quot; </p>

<p>The Daily News also reported that Shipman was wanted for allegedly striking his girlfriend in the head with a brick, and has 21 previous arrests on his record. </p>

<p>No police were injured, though one officer was hospitalized for observation. An investigation is ongoing with the NYPD&apos;s Force Investigation Division.</p>
