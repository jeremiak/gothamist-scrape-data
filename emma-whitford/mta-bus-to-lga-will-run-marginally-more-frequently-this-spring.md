title: MTA Bus To LGA Will Run Marginally More Frequently This Spring

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="112315_LGA.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080032im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/112315_LGA.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> No, not a free shuttle (mockup via Riders Alliance). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>When grassroots transit riders advocacy group Riders Alliance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080032/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/lga_shuttle_bus.php">made a case</a> for a free shuttle bus to-and-from LaGuardia Airport last fall&#x2014;bright blue and clearly marked, equipped with airport maps and airline directories on the interior&#x2014;the MTA dismissed the concept as economically infeasible. </p>

<p>&quot;We wholeheartedly disagree with the premise that this could all be done at no cost to the MTA,&quot; said spokesman Kevin Ortiz, in response to the alliance&apos;s suggestion that a free shuttle could increase ridership along the route by nearly 20%. </p>

<p>&quot;If ridership would continue to grow on the route to the level they claim, we would have to add service, and that costs money,&quot; Ortiz added. &quot;And where would we find the buses?&quot; </p>

<p>But new service along the Q70 line this spring will make trips more frequent, if not free of charge. In a few months, Q70 buses will start running every 8 minutes during peak commuting hours, every 10 minutes on weekends, and every 20 minutes overnight. </p>

<p>&quot;We always want to better serve our customers by strengthening service whenever we have sustainable resources to do so,&quot; said MTA Bus Company president Darryl Irick in a statement. </p>

<p>According to the MTA, the Q70 currently runs every 12 minutes during rush hour, every 15-20 minutes during early morning and late night hours, and every 30 minutes overnight. (Granted, that&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080032/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/15/laguardia_bus.php">official</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080032/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/slow-trip-laguardia-public-transit-article-1.1856948">estimate</a>). </p>

<p>The bus carries passengers directly to LGA from the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Ave E/F/M/R stop or the Woodside LIRR stop, making no local stops&#x2014;the best public transit option for New Yorkers who couldn&apos;t find an affordable flight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080032/http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk-airtrain.html">out of JFK</a>. (The only other public transportation options to LGA at the moment are several local Queens buses, and the M60-SBS bus, which runs select from West 106th Street over to Astoria and on up to the airport.)</p>

<p>According to today&apos;s release, the MTA is also &quot;actively working&quot; to bring select bus service to the Q70 in 2016, ideally reducing travel times to LGA&#x2014;35 minutes at best, according to the MTA&#x2014;with off-board ticketing. </p>

<p>&quot;I consider this a down payment on the real changes that have to happen in order to make public transit an easy and intuitive way to get to the airport,&quot; said Riders Alliance Director John Raskin in a statement. </p>

<p>Indeed, MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg also suggested on Friday that the MTA is no longer quite as wholeheartedly opposed to the concept of a free LaGuardia shuttle as it was last fall. He confirmed that the MTA will consider the policy recommendation this summer as part of its annual assessment of fares and tolls. </p>
