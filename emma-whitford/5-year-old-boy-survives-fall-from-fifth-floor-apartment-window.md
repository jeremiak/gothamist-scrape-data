<p>A 5-year-old boy is in stable condition after falling out of the fifth floor window of his family&apos;s Bronx apartment Tuesday night, according to the police. </p>

<p>The boy, whose name has not been released, fell from 1415 Bristow Street near Boston Road in Crotona Park East at 7:40 p.m., and landed in an alleyway behind the building. Neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143021/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-boy-5-badly-hurt-surviving-5-floor-fall-article-1.2700590">told the Daily News</a> that the child is autistic, but the NYPD could not confirm this Wednesday. </p>

<p>The police also declined to confirm if any criminality is suspected, saying only that the investigation is ongoing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143021/http://pix11.com/2016/07/06/bronx-boy-5-hospitalized-after-falling-from-fifth-floor-apartment-window/">Pix11 reports</a> that the window was barred, but that the protective guard was partially open at the time of the incident. Family members were inside the apartment when the boy fell, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143021/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/06/boy-falls-from-window-bronx/">according to CBS</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;I just heard a scream. He was screaming, &apos;Wahhh!&apos; and, boom, that was it,&quot; one neighbor told the News. &quot;And people were running back and forth trying to get the kid out of the [alley] when the ambulance came.&quot;</p>

<p>The child was listed in critical condition Tuesday night and rushed to Lincoln Hospital in cardiac arrest. His status has since been upgraded to serious, but stable. </p>

<p>On Sunday, 3-year-old Latyr Sene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143021/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/03/toddler-death-harlem/">died</a> after falling 13 stories from his apartment in the Harlem River Houses. CBS reports that a window guard, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143021/https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/window-guards.page">required by NYC law</a>, was in place when Sene fell. </p>
