<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317230908/http://www.pcac.org/pcac/about/history/">New York City Transit Riders Council</a>, the citizens&apos; advisory committee to the MTA, today unveiled its proposal for a so-called &quot;Freedom Ticket&quot;&#x2014;a single-fare alternative to the MetroCard and Commuter Rail ticket. They believe the new fare option would make efficient commuting feasible for New Yorkers who live in some of the city&apos;s &quot;transportation deserts,&quot; like Jamaica in Queens and Fordham and Tremont in the Bronx.</p>

<p>A monthly Freedom Ticket would cost $215&#x2014;36% less than the combined cost of a $218 monthly LIRR pass and a monthly unlimited $116.50 MetroCard. </p>

<p>Taking inspiration from the already-instated City Ticket&#x2014;which allows LIRR and Metro-North riders to commute for reduced fares on the weekends&#x2014;the Freedom Ticket would offer a flat fee for bus, subway and commuter rail travel. For one rate, a Freedom Ticket holder would travel from point A to B with unlimited free transfers. </p>

<p>The NYCTRC chose Southeast Queens as a proof of concept. While the average New Yorker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317230908/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/03/8564283/report-commute-time-nyc-residents-longest-nation">spends six hours and 18 minutes in transit each week</a>, residents in Southeast Queens spend, on average, more than twice that&#x2014;approximately 15 hours.</p>

<p>According to City data, two thirds of New Yorkers who commute more than an hour in each direction make less than $35,000 per year.</p>

<p>A Freedom Ticket would tentatively cost $6.50 one way. That&apos;s more expensive than a local bus or subway commute, but nearly half the price of the current LIRR-to-subway transfer&#x2014;the most efficient commute option from Southeast Queens to Penn Station, clocking in under 40 minutes. </p>

<p>NYCTRC Executive Director Bill Henderson estimates that the switch would cost the MTA about $4.3 million annually in current LIRR riders switching over. </p>

<p>&quot;We think there&apos;s going to be a cost, but we&apos;re suggesting that the city bear that cost,&quot; Henderson told us this morning, making a favorable comparison to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317230908/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/12/lirr_metro_north_nyc.php">recently-proposed subway-equivalent $2.75 fare</a> on commuter rails within city limits.</p>

<p>The MTA has already strongly denounced the $2.75 fare and accompanying free subway transfer as economically infeasible, to the tune of $70 million in annual revenue losses.</p>

<p>&quot;Every Freedom Ticket trip that switches over from a local bus-and-subway commute is a $3 revenue gain,&quot; Henderson added. &quot;If 1,000 riders switch over, that would be an additional $1.5 million per year. If you switch 3,000 you&apos;d be pretty close to breaking even.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the NYCTRC report, just shy of 20,000 LIRR seats are empty on an average peak trip from Jamaica to Penn Station. Therefore, they argue, there&apos;s room on the commuter rail to accommodate significant switchover. </p>

<p>The NYCTRC report recommends that the MTA and the City implement a Freedom Ticket trial in Southeast Queens by 2017, and at all commuter rail stations at least .8 miles from a subway station by 2019. </p>

<p>The MTA, which recently shot down a proposal for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317230908/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/lga_shuttle_bus.php">a free shuttle bus to LaGuardia Airport</a>&#x2014;in addition to the $2.75 commuter rail fare within city limits&#x2014;was less immediately dismissive of the Freedom Ticket. </p>

<p>&quot;&#x200E;It&apos;s an interesting proposal to alleviate the concerns of some of our customers, though it would certainly carry a financial impact for the MTA as well,&quot; said MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg in a statement. &quot;So we&apos;ll consider it next year as we determine how to structure the next in our series of modest fare increases equivalent to the rate of inflation.&quot; </p>
