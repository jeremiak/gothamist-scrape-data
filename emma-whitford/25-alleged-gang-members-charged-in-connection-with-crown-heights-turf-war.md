<p>Twenty-five teenagers and young adults allegedly connected to gangs in Crown Heights were charged in Brooklyn this week. The Brooklyn District Attorney&apos;s office said Wednesday that the rival groups, the Lincoln Family and the Bergen Family (which also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111613/https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=2605%20Queezy">goes by 2605 on Facebook</a>), were allegedly involved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111613/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150109/crown-heights/man-gunned-down-steps-from-crown-heights-home-police-say">fatal shooting of 19-year-old Jaquay (Queezy) Bennett</a> outside of his home on St. Mark&apos;s Place last January, as well as seven other shootings in the neighborhood since October 2013. </p>

<p>&quot;This murder and several shootings terrorized Crown Heights,&quot; said soon-to-be-former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton in a statement Wednesday. Under Bratton&apos;s tenure, shootings have hit record lows. &quot;Despite this city being down twenty percent in shootings and in many murders this year alone, there are small areas of violence that still exist,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>Investigators said this week that both Lincoln and Bergen members &quot;took credit&quot; for various shootings on social media, and posted photos of themselves in rival territory on Facebook, allegedly to taunt each other. </p>

<p>On January 8th of last year, 18-year-old Laquan Battle of the Lincoln Family allegedly shot and killed 19-year-old Bennett, a member of the Bergen Family who went by Queezy, in front of 769 St. Marks Avenue. Police believe the shooting was an act of retaliation for a shooting a few days prior&#x2014;according to the criminal complaint, Lesean Carson, now 16 years old, shot and injured a Lincoln Family member in front of 797 Franklin Avenue on January 5th. </p>

<p>Defendants Isaiah Douglas, 18, Federico Jaen, 19, Linwood Jones, 22, Javon Young, 18, Ebony Brown, 21 and Russell Forest, 18, were charged this week with first-degree conspiracy for allegedly conspiring with Carson. </p>

<p>In a separate incident, on June 2nd, 2014, 18-year-old Ivan Fuentes of the Lincoln Family allegedly biked past members of the Bergen Family in front of 1120 Bergen Street and opened fire, striking one person in the groin. </p>

<p>And as recently as March 10th, several Lincoln Family members allegedly shot at rival Bergen Family members at the corner of Franklin Avenue and President Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111613/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160310/crown-heights/multiple-people-shot-near-crown-heights-school-sources-say">as school let out at nearby Clara Barton High School</a>. The NYPD says that one bullet struck a 13-year-old girl who wasn&apos;t affiliated with either gang. </p>

<p>Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson condemned the &quot;mindless gang and gun violence&quot; in a statement Wednesday. &quot;[It] puts so many people at risk, including in this case an innocent 13-year-old girl,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>The Lincoln Family lays claim to blocks bordered by Classon Avenue, Prospect Place, Bedford Avenue and Eastern Parkway, according to the DA&apos;s office. The Bergen Family, separated from their rivals by a one-block buffer, allegedly claims the blocks bordered by Bergen Street, Kingston Avenue, Park Place and Rogers Avenue. </p>

<p>This week&apos;s 67-count indictment includes charges of conspiracy, murder, attempted murder, and weapons possession, among others. Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. Sullivan ordered that most of the defendants&#x2014;all between the ages of 16 and 23&#x2014;be held without bail ahead of their next court appearance on September 25th. </p>

<p>Three suspects remain at large. </p>
