<p>NYPD Chief of Department Carlos Gomez told reporters on Monday that the department is preparing to deploy more than 5,000 uniformed officers on election day, focusing on the city&apos;s 1,200-plus polling sites as well as both presidential candidates&apos; Midtown party venues. &quot;This is by far the largest election detail that the NYPD has ever had,&quot; Gomez said. &quot;More than double the previous year, and comparable to New Years Eve and the Pope visit.&quot; </p>

<p>A combination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/04/election_terror_threat.php">recent terrorism threats</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/06/voter_intimidation_virginia.php">reported voter intimidation</a> in Virginia over the weekend, and the convergence of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/03/president_elect_nightmare.php">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/us/politics/hillary-clinton-election-night.html">Hillary Clinton</a> in the same, heavily-trafficked neighborhood have the NYPD and Secret Service on high alert. &quot;This presents a very unique set of challenges,&quot; said NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill. &quot;For the first time in modern memory both major party candidates will monitor the results in New York and hold election parties in Midtown.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ve got two things going at once here,&quot; Mayor de Blasio added. &quot;The fact that both candidates are in NYC, and then... that this campaign has generated particular concern.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If we see any evidence of voter intimidation,&quot; he said, &quot;we have the ability to reinforce those sites quickly and make sure that any pattern of intimidation is snuffed out immediately.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to street patrols, the NYPD will stage counterterrorism officers from the city&apos;s newly-established <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/21/nypd_stepping_up_anti-terrorism_eff_1.php">Critical Response Command</a> [CRC], as well as the Strategic Response Command, known among Black Lives Matter protesters who have experienced their tactics firsthand as the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/bratton_nypd_protest_unit.php#photo-1">goon squad</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Our CRC was not here last year,&quot; Counterterrorism Chief Jim Waters told reporters. &quot;We have more than tripled our capacity to protect NYC with 535 CRC people as well as 800 Strategic Response Group personnel&#x2014;long gun trained, counterterrorism trained, and well-prepared to face any threat that comes toward us or any danger coming to NYC.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD&apos;s situation room will be activated with representatives from more than 50 city, state and federal agencies. The FBI&apos;s cyber team will be on call, to monitor for cyber threats in conjunction with the NYPD. </p>

<p>The NYPD&apos;s entire canine unit will also be deployed, as well as hundreds of traffic agents and plainclothes officers. Expect extra cops in the subway, and additional bag checks at station entrances. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/07/street_closures_clinton_trump.php">Street closures</a> are limited to midtown, around Trump Tower in the morning&#x2014;when the candidate passes through&#x2014;as well as the Javits Center, where the Clinton camp is gathering, and the New York Hilton, where Trump&apos;s election night event is taking place. De Blasio said that traffic will likely get worse throughout the day. &quot;A lot of the traffic will be rush hour and into the evening,&quot; he predicted. </p>

<p>With the breadth of Tuesday&apos;s security plan established, Waters addressed a terrorism threat widely reported on Friday. Late last week, unidentified sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/04/election_terror_threat.php">told</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sources-us-intel-warning-of-possible-al-qaeda-attacks-in-us-monday/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=30697951">CBS News</a> that &quot;U.S. intelligence has alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda could be planning attacks in three states for Monday.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It [the threat] lacks specificity and currently the credibility and the sourcing of that information is under investigation and ongoing with no new information since last week,&quot; Waters said. </p>

<p>The NYPD also addressed a threat, reported over the weekend, that ISIS was using social media to urge domestic supporters to disrupt election day with polling place attacks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013747/http://news10.com/2016/11/05/report-isis-calling-for-attacks-against-voters-on-election-day/">ABC reported</a> that the group called on Muslims to announce they&apos;d &quot;come to slaughter you and smash your ballot boxes.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;ISIS puts out these threats widely over their social media before many events,&quot; said Intelligence Counterterrorism Deputy Commissioner John Miller. &quot; We&apos;ve seen them before holidays, we&apos;ve seen them before special events. This is part of their M.O.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ve come to a place where we take these things in stride and almost expect them,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>The NYPD didn&apos;t detail any specific planned protests or rallies, but O&apos;Neill said there will be &quot;enough reserve officers on duty&quot; to address both. </p>

<p>&quot;One of the reasons we&apos;re here [in Times Square],&quot; de Blasio said, &quot;is that we may see protests in the evening, or celebrations. Whatever it may be.&quot; </p>
