<p>Macy&apos;s will close 100 of its 728 nationwide locations starting early next year, according to the company. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=84477&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;cat=news&amp;id=2194923">a press release Thursday</a>, executives said they are closing stores in order to &quot;concentrate... financial resources and talent on our better-performing locations.&quot; The targeted brick-and-mortar locations are still being selected, and won&apos;t be announced until later this year. </p>

<p>In addition to its famous Herald Square location, Macy&apos;s has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://www1.macys.com/shop/store/search?location=New%20York,%20New%20York">outposts</a> in Downtown Brooklyn and Kings Plaza, Rego Park and Flushing in Queens, Staten Island, and Parkchester in the Bronx. </p>

<p>The 2017 closures will exceed the number of Macy&apos;s closures in the last six years combined. </p>

<p>Macy&apos;s is the country&apos;s largest-scale department store&#x2014;a retail concept that has struggled in recent years to compete with online retailers and discount stores. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-department-results-macy-s-idUSKCN10M194?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29">Reuters reports</a> that shoppers are also increasingly interested in making big investments (in cars, electronics), over smaller clothing purchases. Earlier this year, Macy&apos;s announced its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://www.wsj.com/articles/macys-pares-its-forecasts-1462969883">lowest quarterly earnings since the recession</a>. </p>

<p>At its more profitable locations, Macy&apos;s says it&apos;s going to double down on personal shopping services, fine jewelry, and in-store events. (It hasn&apos;t helped the company&apos;s image that designer brands Michael Kors and Coach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-kors-ralph-lauren-battle-discounting-fewer-shopper-visits-1470847066">just announced they&apos;re pulling out of department stores</a>.) </p>

<p>In breaking today&apos;s news, Macy&apos;s also played up its online offerings. &quot;Customers nearly everywhere in America will have easy access to Macy&apos;s stores, with the additional convenience and increased functionality of our dynamic digital offering,&#x201D; Macy&apos;s President Jeff Gennette stated. With money saved, the company is going to work on faster page-loading times for the online store, and a more logical search function. </p>

<p>The company also stated that the stores slated to close are still &quot;cash flow positive,&quot; but have been declining steadily in recent years. In closing 100 stores, Macy&apos;s predicts it will lose about $1 billion in net sales. </p>

<p>&quot;In the short term, our company&apos;s topline sales will be somewhat smaller, but the changes being made will position us to grow comparable sales more quickly,&quot; Genette, who is slotted to succeed Macy&apos;s CEO Terry Lindgren next year, said.</p>

<p>As for the employees at the impacted stores, Macy&apos;s said that it will announce closures to the workers before making them public. Workers &quot;may be offered positions in nearby stores where possible,&quot; and those laid off will get severance packages, according to the company. </p>

<p>Janna Pea, a spokeswoman for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://www.rwdsu.info/">Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union</a> which represents Macy&apos;s workers in NYC, said Thursday that she had no intel on whether any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://www1.macys.com/shop/store/search?location=New%20York,%20New%20York">NYC Macy&apos;s stores</a> might be impacted. Earlier this summer, Macy&apos;s workers in NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626164119/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/business/macys-and-union-have-a-deal-averting-a-strike.html">negotiated a new four-year contract</a>, after threatening to strike. In addition to wage increases, workers secured lower insurance premiums. According to the union, more than 75% of the workers had been unable to afford the higher premiums. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum issued the following statement Thursday: </p>

<blockquote>Macy&#x2019;s needs to create an atmosphere where customers want to come to their stores.  Macy&#x2019;s has to be a special shopping experience made better by well-paid, happy employees that create a great customer experience when they shop. It is essential for Macy&#x2019;s to invest in its people and its stores.  Macy&#x2019;s trying to just become another Amazon would be a mistake.</blockquote>
