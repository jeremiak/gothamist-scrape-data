<p>Asking a subway rider for a MetroCard swipe as he or she heads back to street level is no longer an offense punishable by arrest. Under a new policy instated this week, NYPD officers can issue a $25-50 ticket for a swipe request, or a summons for a court appearance in Lower Manhattan. </p>

<p>The NYPD is following the lead of Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/public_drinking_peeing_party_time.php">suspended arrests for all low-level offenses</a> in his borough&#x2014;from turnstile jumping to public urination&#x2014;in March. Announcing the change earlier this spring, Vance argued that it would conserve NYPD resources and deter about 10,000 cases from criminal court. </p>

<p>Requesting a swipe on another straphanger&apos;s unlimited MetroCard is not technically a violation of MTA policy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://web.mta.info/metrocard/termsunltd.htm">According to the authority</a>, riders only have to wait until their own ride is complete before passing off the favor. But the ask violates two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/subway_information.shtml">NYPD rules</a>&#x2014;it counts as &quot;begging or panhandling,&quot; and can impede &quot;free movement of passengers.&quot; </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/nyregion/spare-a-swipe-new-york-city-eases-rules-for-a-subway-request.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">statement to the NY Times</a>, NYPD Transit Bureau Chief Joseph Fox argued that continuing to enforce these rules is &quot;integral to maintaining the civility for each of our millions of riders,&quot; adding that, &quot;riders have come to expect... to travel without... being subject to overt acts of criminality and disorder.&quot; </p>

<p>But transit activists counter that many desperate straphangers aren&apos;t being overly aggressive when they ask for a swipe. More importantly, they often don&apos;t have another choice. A joint study [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://b.3cdn.net/nycss/7169ea001b71493ce9_lvm6b2ptw.pdf">PDF</a>] released this month by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://www.ridersny.org/">Riders Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://www.cssny.org/">Community Service Society</a>&#x2014;a nonprofit that advocates for low-income New Yorkers&#x2014;found that more than a quarter of low-income, working New Yorkers were unable to afford subway or bus fare at least once in 2015. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://www.policereformorganizingproject.org/">Police Reform Organizing Project</a>, the NYPD made 29,000 arrests for fare beating in 2015&#x2014;more than any other type of arrest.</p>

<p>Lisa Schreibersdorf, Executive Director of Brooklyn Defender Services, said in a statement that her firm sees thousands of clients annually who have been arrested for fare beating. &quot;The vast majority of people arrested for this offense are Black or Latino,&quot; she said. &quot;Many are detained on Rikers Island at a cost of about $500 per day simply because they might not be able to afford a $2.75 subway fare.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a real problem for a lot of people,&quot; said Riders Alliance spokesman Nick Sifuentes on Monday. &quot;This isn&apos;t just a couple of people asking for swipes.&quot; </p>

<p>The Riders Alliance recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/half_price_metrocards_nyc.php">launched a campaign</a> for City-funded half-price MetroCards for low-income New Yorkers. Under the proposed plan, a single ride would cost about $1.35 and riders who purchase monthly cards could save up to $700 per year. &quot;Look, it&apos;s good that the penalty is being reduced,&quot; Sifuentes said of the NYPD&apos;s new swipe policy. &quot;But if the City really wants to do something about this, the right thing to do is a reduced fare program&#x2014;people who can&apos;t pay now would be able to afford a ride.&quot; </p>

<p>PROP Director Robert Gangi argues that, judging by his own frequent observations in arraignment court, the majority of defendants arrested for swipe solicitation walk away without any charges. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519133621/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/01/more_broken_windows_horror_stories.php">recent PROP report</a> found that of 498 arraignments observed in Manhattan and Brooklyn courts between last October and March of this year, 479, or 96.2% of them, resulted in the defendant walking out of the courtroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Being arrested is a difficult and harrowing experience,&quot; Gangis said on Monday. But he argues that a fine is not a huge improvement on the old practice. &quot;The painful irony of fining someone who can&apos;t pay $2.75 for the subway, is that you&apos;re putting an additional hardship on people who are already poor,&quot; he said. </p>
