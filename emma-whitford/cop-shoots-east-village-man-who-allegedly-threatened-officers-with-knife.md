<p>An NYPD sergeant assigned to downtown New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) patrol shot a 25-year-old man believed to be emotionally disturbed in the chest early Tuesday morning. According to police, the man was holding a kitchen knife and &quot;advancing towards the officer in a threatening manner&quot; when the sergeant opened fire.  </p>

<p>A sergeant and officer from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504081507/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/housing_bureau/psa4.shtml">Police Service Area 4</a> responded to a call about an emotionally disturbed person at 911 FDR Drive in the NYCHA-run Jacob Riis Houses shortly after midnight on Tuesday morning, according to the NYPD. Upon arrival, they were told that the man had fled to 765 FDR Drive within the same housing complex. The officers proceeded to the six floor of 765, and heard a &quot;loud commotion&quot; on the floor above. They say they subsequently encountered a man &quot;armed&quot; with a kitchen knife at apartment 7E. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD&apos;s release, the sergeant made &quot;repeated calls&quot; for the man to drop the knife. The man allegedly ignored the order and proceeded forward, prompting the sergeant to shoot once, striking the man in the chest. EMS responded and transported the victim to Bellevue Hospital, where he remains in stable condition. Neither of the officers were injured, and their names have not been released. A knife was recovered from the scene. </p>
