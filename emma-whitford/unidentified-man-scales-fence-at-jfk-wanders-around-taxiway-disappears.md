<p>An unidentified man apparently scaled an eight-foot, razor-wire-topped, sensor-free fence on the perimeter of JFK Airport near Terminal 8, wander around the taxiway, and escaped without being apprehended earlier this month. </p>

<p>The incident took place around 7:00 p.m. on Sunday December 13th, suspending all airport activity for 45 minutes. </p>

<p>According to the Port Authority, airport workers saw a man without proper identification wandering on the taxiway and asked him what he was doing there. The man responded, but did not show ID and &quot;left the area.&quot; Port Authority Police swept the taxiway with a canine unit and &quot;deemed the area safe.&quot; </p>

<p>A police report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042816/http://abc7ny.com/news/investigators-exclusive-man-wanders-taxiway-after-security-breach-at-jfk-airport/1131289/">acquired by ABC7</a> states that two cargo workers told the suspect that he was not authorized to be on the taxiway. The suspect allegedly responded, &quot;You better not say shit&quot; before walking away quickly towards the American Airlines Terminal. </p>

<p>The suspect also offered an excuse for his behavior, explaining that he was looking for the entrance to the A train, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042816/http://nypost.com/2015/12/22/trespasser-sneaks-past-jfk-security-threatens-worker/">according to the Post</a>. One of the cargo workers allegedly called 911, but response was delayed about 10 minutes since the NYPD had to relay the report to the PAPD over a landline&#x2014;there is no direct radio link between the two forces, the Post reports. </p>

<p>Congressman Gregory Meeks, who represents the district surrounding JFK, told ABC7 that he was amazed that portions of the terminal fencing could be sensor-free &quot;in this day and age&quot; when &quot;we have zero room for error.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything is possible,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing, and detectives are reviewing surveillance footage and interviewing potential witnesses. </p>
