<p>Richard Oates, a 32-year-old skateboard shop owner from Greenpoint, died on Tuesday after he slipped from his skateboard while hanging onto the side of a truck as it headed along Delancey Street, police say.<br>
 <br>
Oates was riding his skateboard on Tuesday afternoon, gripping the passenger side of a green Mack truck as it drove west on Delancey, according to a preliminary NYPD investigation. Shortly after 1:15 p.m., Oates fell off of his skateboard and was run over by the truck&apos;s rear passenger-side wheels. EMS responded to the corner of Norfolk Street and transported Oates to Bellevue Hospital where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>The large truck that struck Oates was carrying a shipping container, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160112/lower-east-side/skateboarder-run-over-by-trucks-back-wheels-witnesses-say">according to DNAInfo</a>. One witness told the news outlet that the driver did not immediately stop when Oates was struck. &quot;It appeared like the guy in the... truck didn&apos;t know he hit him,&quot; the witness said. </p>

<p>A spokesman for the NYPD said that the driver stayed on the scene, and that no charges have been filed. An investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>Oates grew up on Long Island and had been living in Brooklyn for more than seven years when he died. The avid skateboarder worked as a chef for multiple Manhattan restaurants, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/http://leftbanknewyork.com/">Left Bank</a> in the West Village and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/http://www.freemansrestaurant.com/">Freemans</a> on the Lower East Side, and lived in Greenpoint with his family. </p>

<p>Oates opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/http://www.eastriverskateshop.com/">East River Skate Shop</a> in Greenpoint last summer with his wife Marisa, a school teacher, according to an early <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2015/06/freemans-chef-opens-east-river-skate-shop-in-greenpoint/">Bedford &amp; Bowery review</a> of the shop. The couple has two children&#x2014;a baby and a toddler. </p>

<p>The skate shop, Oates explained, was a venture that he hoped would allow for more family time. &quot;I spent the past decade working in kitchens, and I&apos;m taking a hiatus from it. We just had a baby, and we have a three-and-a-half year old, so I wanted to be available as a father,&quot; he said in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/https://vimeo.com/135125541">promotional video for the shop</a> published over the summer. </p>

<p>Oates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/http://www.eastriverskateshop.com/about-us">talked to New York magazine</a> in July about his renewed interest in skating. &quot;I got back into skateboarding a while ago as a way to blow of steam, so the jump to a skate shop seemed logical,&quot; he said. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Friends and family have set up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028234729/https://www.gofundme.com/jqjw747q">GoFundMe page</a>, the full balance of which will go to Oates&apos; wife and two young children. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 5:45:</strong> In response to a tip that the driver did not remain on the scene as previously stated by the NYPD, a spokeswoman for the department declined comment citing an ongoing investigation. </p>
