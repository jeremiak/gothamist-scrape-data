<p>You wouldn&apos;t have known it from the steady pop-pop-pop of exploding hoverboards this past holiday season, from the noxious battery smoke hovering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/hoverboard_peril.php">from Brooklyn</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/28/hoverboard_boom.php">to New Jersey</a>, from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/https://twitter.com/NYPDMTN/status/681493841153802240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">PSAs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/10/hoverboards_still_illegal.php">City Council debates</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/more_like_overboard_amirite.php">street fights</a>, but U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been busy fighting the War Against Counterfeit Chargeable Skateboards That Might Spontaneously Combust.</p>

<p>The CBP says it confiscated 1,378 (1,378!) counterfeit hoverboards at JFK airport in December <em>alone</em>. Apparently made in China with sub-par batteries, the lot would have been worth $447,000 at market value. </p>

<p>As CBP&apos;s New York Director Robert Perez put it, &quot;The interception of these potentially dangerous hoverboards is a direct reflection of the vigilance and commitment to mission success.&quot; That, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/30/more_like_overboard_amirite.php">killing fun</a>. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for thrill seeking (or lazy) New Yorkers, even legit boards aren&apos;t wanted here. Get your hands on a board with a legitimate battery, and you&apos;re still dealing with an unregistered motor vehicle that isn&apos;t allowed to set wheels on a sidewalk, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/hoverboards_go_home.php">subway, bus, Amtrak  train, or Access-a-Ride</a>. </p>

<p>And just yesterday, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (USPC) sent a notice to all retailers, manufacturers and importers mandating that hoverboards not compliant with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://mashable.com/2016/02/02/ul-hoverboard-safety/#54qYIxoVuaqA">new safety regulations</a> be confiscated immediately. </p>

<p>This order isn&apos;t the same as a nationwide ban on the boards, but it is likely to prompt recalls. </p>

<p>&quot;This is us drawing a line in the sand and a notice for the entire hoverboard community,&quot; CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000829/http://mashable.com/2016/02/19/hoverboards-unsafe/#EXOjDbnWWaqg">told Mashable</a> this week. &quot;From our perspective, a smart retailer will put in place a stop sale to find out if their inventory complies with our standard. If they are certain that it doesn&#x2019;t, they should then issue a recall proposal.&quot;<br>
