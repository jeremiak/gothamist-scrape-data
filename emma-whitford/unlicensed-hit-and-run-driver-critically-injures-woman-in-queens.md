<p>Denzel Watson, a Far Rockaway resident, was allegedly speeding through the intersection of Beach 19th Street and Seagirt Boulevard in a white Ford Mustang around 1:00 p.m. when he struck a 21-year-old woman. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406054751/http://nypost.com/2015/12/13/woman-critically-injured-after-saving-child-in-hit-and-run/">The Post has identified</a> the victim as one Urabia Nelson, and reports that she was walking with her five-year-old niece London when the crash occurred. London was unharmed, but Nelson remains in critical condition. </p>

<p>&quot;I saw her grab the kid and push her back toward the curb,&quot; a witness told the tabloid. &quot;The driver didn&apos;t even stop, he kept right on going.&quot; </p>

<p>An NYPD spokeswoman could not confirm whether the victim was on the sidewalk when she was struck, as the incident is still under investigation.</p>

<p>Officers caught up to Watson at 1:37 p.m., near the intersection of Virginia Street and Empire Avenue. He has since been charged with leaving the scene of an accident with serious injury and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>The intersection where the crash occurred has been the site of seven crashes so far this year, leaving two injured, according to city data.</p>

<p>A Transportation Alternatives report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406054751/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/deadly_drivers_nyc.php">issued last week</a> found that drivers who failed to yield caused 5,966 crashes resulting in death or injury in 2014, and fewer than 40 of them were prosecuted for it.</p>

<p>This year to date, 24 drivers have been charged with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406054751/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/14/reckless_driving_nyc_nypd.php">misdemeanor failure to yield</a> for injuring or killing pedestrians, according to figures provided by the Mayor&apos;s Office.<br>
