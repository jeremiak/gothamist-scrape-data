<p>Brooklyn NYPD Captain Scott Foster decided to go home at the end of his shift Saturday morning, about forty minutes after two NYPD officers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005211935/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/21/two_nypd_officers_shot_in_bed-stuy_1.php">caught in the crossfire</a> in a Bed-Stuy shootout and transported to Kings County Hospital in Foster&apos;s precinct. The 71st Precinct Captain&apos;s decision to skip customary duties&#x2014;like helping to facilitate communication between the officers&apos; families, the NYPD, and hospital staff&#x2014;were essentially &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005211935/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-captain-clocked-2-cops-shot-brooklyn-article-1.2544020">career suicide</a>,&quot; according to a department source. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, Chief of Department James O&#x2019;Neill and the majority of the NYPD&apos;s top brass came to the hospital that morning to pay respects and issue statements to the press. &quot;Everyone was there,&#x201D; another police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005211935/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-captain-clocked-2-cops-shot-brooklyn-article-1.2544020">told the News</a>. &quot;Foster really fucked up.&quot; As a result of his absence from the hospital Saturday morning, Foster has been stripped of his gun and badge.  </p>

<p>Two department insiders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005211935/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/nyregion/new-york-police-captain-is-put-on-modified-duty-for-not-helping-after-shootout.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">told the NY Times</a> on condition of anonymity that Foster declined his supervisor&apos;s request for assistance. &quot;People told him what was going on and he said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m off duty in a few minutes,&apos;&quot; another source tells the News.</p>

<p>When asked for an explanation later, Foster reportedly said he had been sick. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005211935/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/20/two_nypd_officers_shot_in_bed-stuy.php">shooting</a> broke out around 3:20 a.m. on Saturday, according to the NYPD. Officers William Reddin and Andrew Yurkiw responded to reports of shots fired near the intersection of Quincy Street and Malcolm X Boulevard in Bed-Stuy. The suspect, 34-year-old Jamal Funes, allegedly pointed a revolver at them and fled in a vehicle.</p>

<p>A car chase ensued, in which Funes allegedly shot at the officers from his vehicle. Funes then went the wrong way on Lexington Avenue and slammed into a marked patrol car. During the subsequent standoff with at least eight officers, Reddin was struck in the hip, and Yurkiw was struck in his protective vest at point-blank range. &quot;It&#x2019;s quite possible both officers were struck by bullets from other officers, and possibly deflected bullets,&quot; said Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis after the fact. </p>

<p>Sources told the News that Foster may be demoted to lieutenant status as a result of being a no-show. </p>
