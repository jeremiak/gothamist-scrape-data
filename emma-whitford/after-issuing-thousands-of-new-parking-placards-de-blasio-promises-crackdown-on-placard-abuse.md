<p>On the heels of his decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/05/11/reversing-bloomberg-reforms-city-will-reissue-tens-of-thousands-of-teacher-parking-placards/">issue thousands of new parking permits</a> to Department of Education employees, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday announced a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/342-17/city-hall-your-borough-mayor-de-blasio-new-plan-crack-down-parking-placard">plan</a> to crack down on so-called placard abuse, i.e. when city employees park illegally and rely on city-issued or counterfeit permits to avoid tickets. </p>

<p>&quot;We are going to be adding a number of new enforcement measures and new personnel,&quot; the mayor said. &quot;There will be real consequences for anyone who abuses the placard.&quot; </p>

<p>Placard abuse has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/https://twitter.com/placardabuse">thoroughly documented</a> and decried for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/https://twitter.com/Bahij/status/595237563503349762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2F2015%2F05%2F07%2Fcyclist_tweets_fixjaystreet_at_the.php">years</a>, particularly along municipal corridors like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/07/cyclist_tweets_fixjaystreet_at_the.php">Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn</a>, which is lined with courthouses, as well as a police station and borough jail. Cyclists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bike_lanes_brooklyn.php">have raised concerns</a> about police officers and other city employees double-parking in bike lanes without repercussions, forcing riders to swerve into traffic. Pledges from the Department of Transportation to address the problem have been met with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bike_lanes_brooklyn.php">derision</a>. </p>

<p>The DOT authorizes city placard holders to park at meters without charge, and in &quot;No Parking&quot; spaces, as well as truck loading zones, in most cases. Placards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/pppdinfo.shtml">do not authorize</a> parking in front of fire hydrants, in bus stops or taxi loading zones, in front of driveways, or double parking generally. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio said Wednesday that his decision to award new permits inspired him to &quot;revamp the whole approach&quot; to enforcement. Addressing reporters in the Bronx, he announced the creation of a Placard Fraud Enforcement Unit within the NYPD. Sixteen new officers will focus on identifying counterfeit placards and illegal parking in to-be-announced hot spots, while 100 new traffic agents will be trained to seek out abuses city-wide, he said. </p>

<p>Consequences will also be clarified. A new $100 fine will be instated for placard misuse, on top of existing parking violations. City employees will also be subject to &quot;permanent ineligibility&quot; for placards, which will now be reissued on an annual basis. Additional towing capacity is being added, and a new &quot;DOE Placard Unit&quot; will field complaints and met out discipline for DOE placards, specifically. </p>

<p>New DOE placards will also be issued for a limited stock of parking spaces&#x2014;a measure de Blasio said will prevent road congestion and dangerous parking. &quot;We think it will, in the end, level off,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>There are currently 44,496 NYPD placards, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/https://twitter.com/jdavidgoodman/status/867433845930565632">62,000 DOE placards</a>, and 54,020 DOT placards, according to the Mayor&apos;s Office. </p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s clear, regardless of the number of permits, is they have to be used the right way, and we have plenty of ability to crack down when they&apos;re not used the right way,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;I think what&apos;s happened in the past too often is there weren&apos;t clear consequences.&quot; </p>

<p>Throughout the conference, Mayor de Blasio described the issuance of new DOE permits as a &quot;compromise&quot; measure. </p>

<p>In 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/05/11/reversing-bloomberg-reforms-city-will-reissue-tens-of-thousands-of-teacher-parking-placards/">Streetsblog reports</a>, then-mayor Bloomberg slashed the number of DOE permits from 63,000 to 11,000. The Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, a principals union, sued in 2009 to have said permits reinstated. Earlier this month, the CSA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/https://www.csa-nyc.org/news/view/2637/the-sun-will-shine-on-your-parking-space-once-more">stated</a> that, &quot;CSA litigated and won the permits but the city decided on its own to grant permits to teachers as well.&quot; </p>

<p>Critics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/https://twitter.com/BrooklynSpoke/status/867432011757219840">remain skeptical</a> that new enforcement measures will have teeth, considering the NYPD&apos;s track record of lax enforcement and this latest influx of thousands of new permits. </p>

<p>&quot;I think the NYPD has, over the last few decades, done an extraordinary job addressing internal challenges,&quot; de Blasio said in response to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/https://twitter.com/brigidbergin/status/867431228714233856">one reporter&apos;s skepticism</a>. </p>

<p>New Yorkers also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/https://twitter.com/DanielCFletcher/status/867431052075257857">balked</a> at de Blasio&apos;s apparent framing of placard abuse as a problem primarily faced by drivers. &quot;People need every minute they can for the good things in life and end up spending a huge amount of time looking for a parking space,&quot; the mayor said. </p>

<p>&quot;Parking is one of the biggest quality of life concerns for all New Yorkers,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>Following Mayor de Blasio at the podium Wednesday, City Council Transportation Committee Chair Ydnais Rodrgiuez noted that only 1.2 million New York City households own cars. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://blog.tstc.org/2017/04/21/car-free-new-york-city/">new fact sheet</a> from the Tri-State Transportation Campaign shows that 54.5 percent of NYC households are car free, though car ownership is on the rise overall. </p>

<p>&quot;I hope we won&apos;t see as many cars on our roads, because as New Yorkers, public employees know public transit is the best way to get around,&quot; Rodriguez said. </p>

<p>DOE Chancellor Carmen Fari&#xF1;a said Wednesday that she plans to encourage teachers not to drive, new permits notwithstanding. &quot;We will be sending a letter to all staff saying that public transportation is still the best option,&quot; she said. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710012428/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/22/subway_is_bad.php">Heh</a>.</p>
