<p>Love it or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/10/love_or_hate_th.php">NIMBY it</a>, the Queens Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City has been prioritized for landmark status, and could be officially protected in all of its corporate, neon glory before the end of the year. </p>

<p>Installed in 1936 on top of the long-since-demolished Queens Pepsi bottling plant, the sign has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/9/dtg-greenwood-cemetery-landmarks-backlog-2016-02-26-bk.html?utm_source=20160224&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=storylink&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter">dismantled and shifted</a> along the Queens waterfront multiple times since the late 1990s. In 2013, a 25-story apartment tower on the Queens waterfront was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/nyregion/as-a-queens-tower-rises-a-spot-is-saved-for-pepsi-cola.html">partially recessed</a> to give the sign a respectful amount of breathing room. </p>

<p>The 147-foot-long sign and 29 other properties and sites across the city survived a Landmarks Preservation Commission gauntlet on Tuesday afternoon. Of the 95 NYC buildings, structures, and plots of land up for consideration&#x2014;some of which had been trapped in the Commission&apos;s backlog for five decades&#x2014;35 were nixed. Once a site or piece of property is rejected by the LPC, it&apos;s owner is free to alter or demolish it. Those still under consideration will receive a final vote by December. </p>

<p>Also on track for preservation as of this week is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/24/photos_holiday_windows_are_here_to.php">Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue</a> in Manhattan, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/https://www.facebook.com/harlemy">Harlem YMCA</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20151023/hells-kitchen-clinton/do-or-die-moment-for-preservation-of-west-side-irt-powerhouse-activists">IRT Powerhouse</a> at 12th Avenue and 59th Street, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/nyregion/landmark-status-is-urged-for-30-new-york-city-properties.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion">the NY Times points out</a> is still an active Con Ed facility (the Commission apparently has plans to work closely with the company on a LPC-complaint maintenance plan.) Green-Wood Cemetery will be considered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/9/dtg-greenwood-cemetery-landmarks-backlog-2016-02-26-bk.html?utm_source=20160224&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=storylink&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter">only in part</a>, because a full designation would make it extremely difficult to &quot;alter&quot; the active burial site. (&quot;You don&apos;t want to have to check with a government agency when you put in a new headstone,&quot; NY Mag architecture critic Justin Davidson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://www.wnyc.org/story/city-landmarks-commission-tackles-backlog/">told WNYC this week</a>.) </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/coney_island_pumping_station.pdf">Coney Island pumping station</a>, which has fallen into disrepair since it went out of commission in the 1970s, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/9/bn-no-landmark-for-pumping-station-2016-02-26-bk.html?utm_source=20160224&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=storylink&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter">not so lucky</a>. According to the NY Times, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233228/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur_Home">123 Lexington Avenue</a>, the one-time home of President Chester Arthur, also didn&apos;t make the cut&#x2014;in part because the lower floors had been converted into storefronts. </p>

<p>Davidson argued on Monday that there&apos;s certain risk to cutting down such a big backlog in just a few hours. &quot;If you decide that you&apos;re not going to landmark something, and then later you decide that that was a mistake, that&apos;s too bad,&quot; he said. </p>
