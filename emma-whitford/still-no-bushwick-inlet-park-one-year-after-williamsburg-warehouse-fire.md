<p>One year ago on Sunday, a 7-alarm fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/31/4-alarm_fire_raging_in_williamsburg.php#photo-8">ripped through the CitiStorage warehouse</a> on the Williamsburg waterfront, spewing heavy smoke over Brooklyn. The fire also raised fears among locals that the now-charred site would be sold to a wealthy developer, solidifying the pipe-dream status of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/07/photos_video_protestors_stage_proje.php#photo-1">long-awaited</a> Bushwick Inlet Park. </p>

<p>Back in 2005, then-Mayor Bloomberg promised a 28-acre park encompassing the CitiStorage site as part of a major Williamsburg waterfront rezoning initiative. The fate of CitiStorage is still unclear, and yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/02/how-many-ways-can-you-say-wheres-my-williamsburg-waterfront-park/">neighbors and local politicians gathered</a> at the site, urging Mayor de Blasio to make good on a Bloomberg-era promise. </p>

<p>&quot;What is there to say other than, &apos;Where&apos;s our park?&apos; The promise was made, and do it. I mean how many different ways can we say that?&quot; said Senator Daniel Squadron on Sunday. </p>

<p>In 2011, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/oops_no_money_for_promised_bushwick.php#photo-1">Bloomberg admitted</a> that he didn&apos;t have the money to buy the 11-acre CitiStorage site, which sits between North 10th and North 11th Streets. At the time, he estimated that the site would cost between $60 and $90 million. By last June, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/arts/design/price-tag-on-a-brooklyn-park-reaches-225-million-and-thats-only-the-beginning.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">the NY Times reports</a>, the city had spent $225 million buying up just nine acres of the proposed 28. For context, Bushwick Inlet has already exceeded the Highline in taxpayer costs.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20151229/REAL_ESTATE/151229962/related-cos-in-talks-for-11-acre-williamsburg-waterfront-site">According to Crain&apos;s</a>, CitiStorage owner Norman Brodsky has valued the site at $500 million. The news outlet reported a possible $250 million deal in December&#x2014;Hudson Yards developer Related Companies would purchase the site with partners Midtown Equities and East End Capital, and convert it into a residential development with some compromise parkland. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/2/dtg-bushwick-inlet-park-rezoning-deal-2016-01-08-bk.html">reportedly</a> shot down the rumored deal, to the relief of local advocates. &quot;The administration would never accept a rezoning here that did not have the support of the councilman and community,&#x201D; he said in a statement. </p>

<p>Brodsky has since stated that a deal with Related Companies would not go through without the Mayor&apos;s approval. &quot;Most of the people who came to me thought that they could get it rezoned into some sort of housing, and obviously the mayor has taken a position that, without the community&#x2019;s approval, he&#x2019;s never going to do that,&quot; Brodsky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/01/year-after-citistorage-fire-park-conversion-is-still-a-hot-topic/">told Bedford + Bowery</a>. </p>

<p>However, he also told the outlet that he gets bids on the property &quot;every day,&quot; and will have to act &quot;sooner rather than latter.&quot; </p>

<p>As it now stands, members of the advocacy group Friends of Bushwick Inlet Park would like to see the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/01/year-after-citistorage-fire-park-conversion-is-still-a-hot-topic/">invoke eminent domain</a> to acquire the property.</p>

<p>Over the summer, the Parks Department stated that it was &quot;taking substantive steps&quot; to complete Bushwick Inlet Park. However, asked at a City Council meeting if he was committed to buying CitiStorage, Parks Commissioner Mitchell Silver replied, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021105054/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/is_bushwick_inlet_park_worth_all_th.php">Ah, I did not say that.</a>&quot; </p>
