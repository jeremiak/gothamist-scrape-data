<p>A JetBlue flight en route to Bermuda out of JFK Airport made an emergency landing in Boston this morning, to address a &quot;non-critical equipment issue.&quot; The airline confirmed that flight 1731 may have been struck by lightning this morning, but said that the lightning strike didn&apos;t precipitate the landing. </p>

<p>&quot;Maintenance crews will inspect the aircraft following reports of an unrelated lightning strike that may have occurred while en-route to Boston,&quot; said JetBlue spokesman Morgan Johnston in a statement. &quot;Customers will be accommodated on another flight on to Bermuda.&quot; </p>

<p>Asked for more information on what part of the plane was impacted, Johnston declined to comment. </p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed Monday that JetBlue 1731, an Airbus A320, landed safely on Runway 4R at Boston Logan International Airport at 9:44 a.m. The Administration was less definitive on the role the lightning strike might have played in the incident, saying that the plane landed &quot;after reporting a possible lightning strike.&quot;</p>

<p>The FAA is investigating. </p>
