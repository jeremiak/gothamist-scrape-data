<p>When the NYPD got tired of Staten Island Ferry riders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104456/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/15/no_juice_for_you.php">fighting over power outlets</a> for their phones and laptops&#x2014;one ferry worker even got punched to the ground while attempting to break up a power outlet dispute&#x2014;the Department of Transportation responded by cutting off the juice to most of the charging ports (the ones &quot;linked with violence,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104456/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/staten_island_ferry_usb_ports.html#incart_river_home_pop">according to the NYPD</a>). Now, in a happy reversal, the city has confirmed that it plans to install USB chargers throughout the Manhattan and Staten Island terminals this fall, and on the ferries soon after. </p>

<p>When new boats join the fleet in 2019, the city promises they&apos;ll also be outfitted with the latest in charging technology. (By then, most of us will be fully charged from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104456/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/ferrari_bus_identical.php">bus</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104456/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/18/no_escape_poop_car.php">train or the subway platform</a>, anyway.)  </p>

<p>&quot;DOT wants to strike a balance by embracing ever-evolving phone charging technology, but also address public safety,&quot; DOT spokesman Scott Gastel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104456/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/staten_island_ferry_usb_ports.html#incart_river_home_pop">told the Staten Island Advance</a>. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve asked the city to clarify its logic&#x2014;will there be so many USB chargers on each boat that commuters won&apos;t have to compete?&#x2014;and will update if we get more details.</p>

<p>The DOT has retained the right to cut off power on Staten Island Ferry boats for several years, pre-dating the de Blasio administration. The decision was apparently born of a request for assistance from the NYPD, after cops decided that the outlets posed a safety threat.</p>
