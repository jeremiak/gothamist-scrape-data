										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2017_04_pitbull2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504131308im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_04_pitbull2.jpg" width="300" height="320"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Lola</i></div> A police officer shot a pit bull five times inside a Prospect Heights apartment building early Sunday morning, killing her, according to the NYPD and media reports. <p></p>

<p>A spokesman for the NYPD said that the incident took place around 4:20 a.m. on Sunday, on the tenth floor of 36 Plaza Street East, near Grand Army Plaza. He could not confirm what prompted two officers to enter the building, nor what prompted one officer to shoot. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504131308/http://nypost.com/2017/04/23/police-shoot-pit-bull-to-death/">The NY Post reports</a> that a taxi driver called the police after a passenger skipped out on his fare. The passenger left his wallet in the cab, according to the tabloid, saying he would return with cash. Cops allegedly responded to the address on the passenger&apos;s ID, which led them to the Plaza Street East apartment.</p>

<p>The pit bull allegedly &quot;charged&quot; officers when her owner, Diego Azurdia, opened the door. The officers were uninjured. </p>

<p>Azurdia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His Facebook is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504131308/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102935773273623&amp;set=a.728078198293.2307185.214831&amp;type=3&amp;theater">full of pictures</a> of his late dog, Lola. </p>

<p>&quot;It just seems wildly disproportionate, to shoot five times like that,&#x201D; a 32-year-old neighbor <a href="nypost.com/2017/04/24/neighbors-outraged-over-cop-who-shot-sweet-pit-bull-to-death/">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve shared many an elevator ride with Lola, and she was always very sweet. I never felt unsafe.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Last month, Bed-Stuy residents were outraged when a police officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504131308/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/20/bed_stuy_dog_shooting.php">fatally shot an off-leash pit bull mix</a> named Ziggy in Saratoga Park. Police said the dog lunged at the officer, though the owner disputed that account. </p>
