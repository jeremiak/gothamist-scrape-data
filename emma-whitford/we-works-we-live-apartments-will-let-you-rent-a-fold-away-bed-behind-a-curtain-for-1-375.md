(WeLive)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/https://www.wework.com/locations/new-york-city?utm_source=ads-google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=%2Bwework&amp;utm_campaign=l-nyc-geo&amp;utm_content=c&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwxI24BRDqqN3f-97N6egBEiQAGv37hNCBkNixbRVxW-eE7tiNb3rAt0owH8iuP3-6jCcZnEYaApPq8P8HAQ">WeWork</a>, the international co-working startup recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/http://www.fastcompany.com/3057670/wework-valuation-soars-to-16-billion">valued at $16 billion</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/11/we_l_i_v_i_n.php">announced in January</a> that 20 floors at its 110 Wall Street location had been converted into fully-furnished apartments for the app creators to whom they cater. At the time, the company dropped juicy hints about the amenities that lubricate a life probably spent full-time disrupting: on-site yoga studio and movie theater; laundry, cleaning and utilities included; a &quot;community manager&quot; to organize building-wide karaoke. The cost of living this way was demurely withheld. </p>

<p>Now the apartments are officially on the market, and WeWork has confirmed that all of this can be yours for as little as $1,375&#x2014;if you&apos;re willing to sleep in a fold-out Murphy bed, behind a curtain, in the living room. Or, if you&apos;d rather not lift your bed into the wall every morning, an alcove bed niched into the living room with a privacy curtain. </p>

<p>Studios, and by extension privacy, cost from $2,000, not including the $125 monthly amenities fee that lumps in cleaning and laundry, but also all of the things that WeLive doesn&apos;t expect you to acquire for yourself: coffee, San Pellegrino, Smart Water, bitters, cups, spoons, forks, toiletries, furniture, sheets, clothes hangers, cable, and internet. There&apos;s also an inter-building app for requesting a babysitter or a PR logo from your upstairs neighbor, a la this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/17/sign_now_slack_included.php">dope building-wide Slack channel</a>. Here&apos;s a taste, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/04/04/inside-wework-coliving-space-welive/#12b6a5956f00">courtesy of Forbes</a>: </p>

<blockquote>A walk through WeLive feels like a stroll through a millennial office worker Narnia, from the lounge spaces with bar areas (providing all the bitters and shakers a wannabe mixologist would need) to the laundry room that looks more like a game room with ping pong and billiards, to the roof deck complete with jacuzzi that&#x2019;s opening soon. There&#x2019;s a wellness room for yoga and Barre classes and an &#x201C;honesty bar&#x201D; stocked with basic toiletries.</blockquote>

<p>And the apartments are small&#x2014;450 square feet on average&#x2014;apparently to encourage people to spend minimal time away from the daily grind of networking in the communal kitchen-dining rooms (one for every three floors, which are clustered together in so-called &quot;neighborhoods,&quot; each with their own laundry-game room and barre-yoga studio). </p>

<p>&quot;WeLive replicates the security and comfort of a suburban neighborhood but with the energy and vigor of a major city,&quot; said the company in a statement. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for the company confirmed that you don&apos;t have to belong to WeWork (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/https://www.wework.com/pricing?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=ads-google&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink-pricing&amp;gclid=CLuetM-i-MsCFYwkhgodjWwLWQ">$325/month</a> for dedicated desk space and benefits) to live at WeLive, although if you do, that&apos;s a plus. Leases are available month-to-month, as well as in six, 12, and 24 month contracts. Background checks, yes, but no brokers fees or credit checks. </p>

<p>As for the neighbors, &quot;We are happy if there are some bros here having a good time,&quot; WeWork cofounder Miguel McKelvey told Forbes this week. &quot;But there will also be people here eating wine and nice cheese and watching The Bachelor, too. It&apos;ll be diverse, and if we do our job, it will stay that way.&quot;</p>

<p>WeWork was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/02/janitors_at_wework_office_spaces.php">hammered with bad press</a> last year when about 150 of its non-union office cleaners protested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045246/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/05/wework_janitors.php">making as little as $10/hr</a> and were subsequently fired. The startup has since established a living wage of $18/hr for its cleaners, hired some of the old workers back, and pledged to work with union subcontractors.</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong> An earlier version of this piece incorrectly stated the price for desk space at WeWork. </p>
