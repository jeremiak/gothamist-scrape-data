<p>NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed on Monday afternoon that police have arrested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135832/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/nypd_ids_man_chelsea_explosion.php#photo-1">Ahmad Khan Rahami</a>, 28, the man sought for questioning in relation to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135832/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/chelsea_explosion.php">Saturday night explosion in Chelsea</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135832/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/pipe_bomb_explodes_on_route_of_seas.php">Saturday morning explosion in Seaside Park</a>, New Jersey. Rahami is currently in custody, and is expected to be interviewed today. He has yet to be charged. </p>

<p>&quot;We have directly linked him to devices in New York and New Jersey,&quot; said FBI New York Special Agent William Sweeney. Sweeney would not discuss his bureau&apos;s investigative &quot;methods,&quot; citing an ongoing investigation into Rahami&apos;s &quot;social network.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m a lot happier today than I was yesterday,&quot; said Commissioner O&apos;Neill, who had just stepped away from his swearing-in ceremony. Stressing that the investigation is ongoing, he added, &quot;Now we can focus on whether this individual acted alone, and what his motives might have been.&quot; According to the NYPD, police are not currently following any specific tips regarding an accomplice, or any additional bombs.  </p>

<p>Rahami was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135832/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/ahmad_khan_rahami.php#photo-1">apprehended during a shootout</a> in Linden, New Jersey this morning, four miles from Elizabeth, his last known address. Police confirmed that two officers were injured during the encounter. Rahami himself was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135832/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/NYC-Possible-Lead-Man-Seen-Surveillance-Video-Chelsea-Bomb-Blast--393911431.html">hospitalized</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Based on the info we have now, we have every reason to believe this was an act of terror,&quot;  de Blasio said. </p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Chelsea explosion, the mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135832/https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiroc-_jZzPAhUDbz4KHZsZB_0QqQIIHDAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2F2016%2F09%2F17%2Fchelsea_explosion.php&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeZ0R89Ua9bpW2gOZCQDkAABUlVw&amp;sig2=bsu4IlyNkaDxEkqDg1uQTQ&amp;bvm=bv.133178914,d.cWw">stated</a> that it &quot;did not seem that the blast was related to terrorism.&quot; Asked what had changed, de Blasio deferred to Counterterrorism Assistant Commissioner John Miller. </p>

<p>&quot;A bomb going off in an NYC street is a terrifying act,&quot; Miller said. &quot;Whether it&apos;s an act of terrorism is determined by who did it, and why they did it. The basic definition of terrorism on the Federal Law side is, the use or threat of fear, violence or intimidation to achieve political or social change. From the outset of this case, our first priority was to find out who was behind it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The broadening understanding about the suspect who is in custody right now for the shooting of police officers will bring forth the charge,&quot; he added.  </p>

<p>Police did not elaborate on Rahami&apos;s personal life on Monday. &quot;There&apos;s no information to show what his path of radicalization was,&quot; O&apos;Neill said, alluding that more information will be available once Rahami has been interviewed. &quot;We have nothing to indicate that he was on our radar,&quot; he added. &quot;We have allegations of a domestic incident [committed by Rahami] that were recanted.&quot; </p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara told reporters Monday that, &quot;I believe there is going to be a charge based on the shooting of officers.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The U.S. Attorney&apos; office is working to put together as comprehensive and thorough a collection of allegations as make sense,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>Agent Sweeney said that five people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135832/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/federal-agents-arrest-people-linked-chelsea-bombing-article-1.2797378">stopped and apprehended on the Belt Parkway last night</a>, near the Verrazano Narrows, have been questioned and released. According to Sweeney, the same car had been seen at a location &quot;associated with&quot; Rahami. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner O&apos;Neill said the decision to send a push notification to New Yorkers&apos; cellphones regarding Rahami this morning had an &quot;extraordinary&quot; impact on the investigation, though they could not confirm if a civilian responding to said alert ultimately led New Jersey police to Rahami. </p>

<p>&quot;We think it&apos;s a very valuable tool. That it created a lot of focus and urgency,&quot; de Blasio said, adding, &quot;It was very appropriate and something they will use in the future.&quot; </p>

<p>Some countered on Monday that the push notification unnecessarily stoked prejudice. </p>
