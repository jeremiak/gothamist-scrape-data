<p>Private and religiously-affiliated schools in New York City will receive $20 million in funding to hire full-time security guards, thanks to legislation passed by the City Council on Monday.</p>

<p>According to the new law, private schools with at least 300 students will be eligible for at least one full-time, unarmed security guard starting in April 2016. The City would fund hiring and training, as well as wages. </p>

<p>Councilmember David Greenfield, who represents Borough Park and Midwood&#x2014;where many Jewish schools are concentrated&#x2014;sponsored the bill. </p>

<p>&quot;I introduced this legislation originally post-Sandy Hook, when it was clear that nonpublic schools do not have the protections that the public schools had,&quot; the councilmember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427024949/http://www.wnyc.org/story/city-council-approve-security-guards-private-schools/">told WNYC this morning</a>. As for the recent mass-shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, &quot;It&apos;s another benefit of having security, but that was not the impetus.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427024949/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/city-council-set-approve-security-nyc-private-schools-article-1.2447020">According to the News</a>, about 250,000 students attend 800 nonpublic schools in NYC. Almost half of these students, more than 110,00 of them, attend Jewish yeshivas. Greenfield said that yeshivas are susceptible to anti-semitic hate crimes, but that Muslim and Catholic schools could benefit from protection against bias crimes as well. </p>

<p>WNYC reports that 267 hate crimes have been reported to the NYPD through November 22, compared to 288 during the same period last year. Two women in hijab were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427024949/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/25/mailman_hate_crime.php">allegedly spit on</a> late last month, and a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427024949/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/uws_hate_crime_assault.php">shouting anti-Semitic slurs and violent threats</a> assaulted the owner of an Upper West Side Jewish supply store on December 1st. </p>

<p>Greenfield initially called for $50 million in funding for the initiative, but scaled back when the City objected. Mayor de Blasio has since voiced his support of the bill, under the condition that the guards are private, rather than NYPD-affiliated. </p>

<p>The Mayor said in a statement Monday that the new law &quot;recognizes community needs, while addressing administration concerns about diverting critical police resources.&quot; </p>

<p>The New York Civil Liberties Union is strongly opposed to diverting public funding to schools that already charge students for tuition. </p>

<p>&quot;To suggest that these private, sectarian institutions that receive monetary support from their students and private donors should be financially supported by the city as well is not only bad policy, it is an example of unconstitutional government support for religious institutions,&quot; said  NYCLU&apos;s advocacy director Johanna Miller in a statement. </p>

<p>Danny Dromm, the Council&apos;s Education Committee chair, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427024949/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gonzalez-nyc-taxpayers-fund-guards-private-schools-article-1.2454780">also balked</a>, arguing that some of the eligible schools are already quite expensive, charging students up to $25,000 a year in tuition. &quot;We&apos;re giving away $20 million to these private and religious schools when that money is desperately need for our own public school pupils,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Many elite private schools, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427024949/http://www.horacemann.org/page.cfm?p=140">Horace Mann</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427024949/http://open.avenues.org/en/tag/security">Avenues: The World School</a>, already have established private security teams.</p>
