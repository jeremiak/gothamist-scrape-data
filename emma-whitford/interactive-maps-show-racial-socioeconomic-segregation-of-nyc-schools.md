					<p>Tens of thousands of low-income elementary school students in New York City attend public schools that exist as socioeconomic and racial islands within diverse neighborhoods, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://www.centernyc.org/schoolsegregation">new study</a> conducted by the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School. </p>

<p>&quot;Segregation is not always the result of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/07/is_new_york_as_racially_segregated.php">housing patterns</a>,&quot; write the study&apos;s authors. &quot;The city&apos;s schools are even more economically and racially segregated than the neighborhoods, and for economically disadvantaged students, that usually translates to inferior education.&quot; </p>

<p>There are 734 neighborhood elementary schools in New York City, and at roughly 17% of them the median enrolled family earns 20% less than the median income in the surrounding neighborhood. </p>

<p>This discrepancy is stark on the study&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://www.centernyc.org/segregatedschools">income map</a>&#x2014;light green dots representing schools where the median family income hovers between $30,000 and $41,000 are set off by dark green neighborhoods like DUMBO, Downtown Brooklyn, Red Hook and the Upper East Side, where the median income rangers from $60-95,000. At PS 125 in Harlem, the average family makes less than half of the zone&apos;s median income. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="121516_Schools1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/121516_Schools1.jpeg" width="640" height="329"> <br> <i> (The New School&apos;s Center for New York City Affairs)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>More than half of the public schools in the city, 332 of them, are more than 90% black and Latino, according to the study&apos;s findings. While the vast majority of these schools are in majority-black and Latino neighborhoods&#x2014;Hunts Point, Harlem, East New York&#x2014;59 of them are in neighborhoods that have larger white populations, like Sunnyside, Williamsburg, and Boerum Hill.  </p>

<p>At PS 287 in Downtown Brooklyn, an extreme, the school enrollment is 89% minority, compared to 43% minority in the zone. </p>

<p>The study&apos;s authors attribute this segregation to a tendency among wealthier parents to &quot;vote with their feet.&quot; Rather than send their children to the neighborhood school with, say, low state test scores, they&apos;ll opt for a private or charter school. </p>

<p>Two of the most segregated school districts on the map, District 13 in Downtown Brooklyn and District 3 on the Upper West Side, have been embroiled in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/schools_brooklyn_race_class.php">contentious rezoning battles</a> this fall&#x2014;proof of the conflicts that arise when parents dig their heels into their assigned districts, and vie for precious spots at higher performing neighborhood schools. </p>

<p>In both neighborhoods, NYCHA-run housing complexes (purple on the maps) share the skyline with an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/realestate/an-upper-west-side-boomlet.html">increasing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/realestate/transforming-a-brooklyn-neighborhood-with-new-condos.html?_r=1">number </a>of new high-rises. Real estate developers push these new rentals on the merits of local high-performing public schools&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/22/dumbo_school_rezoning_fight.php">PS 8 in Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/29/uws_school_zoning_fight.php">PS 199 in Manhattan</a>. As a result, two predominantly white and upper-middle-class public schools have grappled with some of the longest waiting lists in the city, while two lower-income, predominantly black and Latino schools struggle with smaller enrollments. </p>

<p>The solution to city-wide racial and socioeconomic disparity in public schools, the study posits, is to &quot;improve&quot; struggling public schools and, in doing so, attract more affluent families. </p>

<p>But in DUMBO and upper Manhattan, the prospect of &quot;improvement&quot; has proven to be a chicken-and-egg problem. Many parents are drawn to already-flourishing schools with powerhouse Parent Teacher Associations and the funding and programming they generate for their children. </p>

<p>As a result, the very same parents with the time and resources to invest in their children&apos;s schools continue to balk at the very schools that could benefit from their interest.  </p>

<p>&quot;Families don&apos;t want to gamble with their kids,&quot; Andrea Steinkamp, co-PTA president of PS 199, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034209/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/29/uws_school_zoning_fight.php">told us this fall</a>. Thanks in large part to 140 parent volunteers, her group&apos;s annual October walkathon raised about $50,000. </p>

<p>&quot;When you look online and see that a school with only 10% of its students passing exams,&quot; Steinkamp said of neighboring PS 191, &quot;that&apos;s a big risk.&quot; </p>
