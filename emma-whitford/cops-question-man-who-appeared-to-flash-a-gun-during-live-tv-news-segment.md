										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="021116_Interruption.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712005216im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/021116_Interruption.jpeg" width="300" height="395"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> (via DCPI)</i></div> The NYPD is questioning a man they believe may have jumped into the frame of an NBC live broadcast outside of Brooklyn Supreme Court on Wednesday, smiling and waving what looked like a small silver gun. <p></p>

<p>NBC correspondant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712005216/https://twitter.com/mgeorge4NY?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Michael George</a> was reporting live outside of the Brooklyn courthouse shortly after noon on Wednesday, for a segment about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712005216/http://gothamist.com/tags/akaigurley">ongoing trial of NYPD Officer Peter Liang</a>, charged with manslaughter and reckless endangerment in the killing of Akai Gurley in a darkened Brooklyn stairwell.  </p>

<p>&quot;Officer Liang was a rookie cop with little training,&quot; George told his viewers at home, just as the suspect popped into the frame, brushed the anchor&apos;s shoulder, and waved what appeared to be a gun for a few seconds, smiling gleefully. </p>

<p>The News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712005216/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-man-nabbed-waving-gun-tv-broadcast-article-1.2528306?utm_content=buffere638f&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">cites NYPD sources</a> who believe the &quot;pistol&quot; might have actually been a gag lighter shaped like a gun, although a spokesman for the department could not immediately confirm this. Regardless, probably not the best idea, at least for anyone hoping to avoid being arrested.  </p>

<p>The suspect is clearly visible in NBC&apos;s footage&#x2014;the clip below was edited by the NYPD&#x2014;wearing a brown jacket and a beige baseball hat. </p>

<p>The NYPD confirmed that no charges have been filed against the suspect in custody, and that the investigation is ongoing. The man who did the deed is believed to be about 35 years old, and about 5&apos;7&quot;. </p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
