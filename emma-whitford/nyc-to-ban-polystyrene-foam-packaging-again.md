title: NYC To Ban Polystyrene Foam Packaging (Again)

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/08/plastic_foam_ban.php">Polystyrene foam</a>: that stubborn, squeaky takeout container substance keeps floating to the surface. Literally, in our waterways, and figuratively, in our politics. </p>

<p>In this latest installment, we have warring City Council bills. One would ban the substance permanently, the other see it enshrined in NYC take-out restaurants. </p>

<p>But for now, at least, a new ban is in effect&#x2014;a Department of Sanitation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/docs/2017-05-12FoamDetermination_FINAL.pdf">report issued Friday</a> found the stuff non-recyclable, and stated that &quot;no food service establishment, mobile food commissary, or store shall possess, sell, or offer for use single service articles that consist of expanded polystyrene&quot; starting on November 13, 2017. </p>

<p>To recap the foamy saga: the City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/08/plastic_foam_ban.php">banned polystyrene take-out containers</a> in 2013. But the law didn&apos;t go into effect until mid-2015&#x2014;following a Department of Sanitation study that deemed the containers non-recyclable&#x2014;and was almost immediately overturned. A coalition including groups with a vested interest in styrofoam containers (a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://www.restaurantactionalliancenyc.com/">restaurant trade group</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/https://www.dartcontainer.com/home/">major manufacturer of said containers</a>) sued the city, arguing that the clam shells are indeed recyclable. A judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/22/nyc_styrofoam_ban_overturned_by_jud.php">sided with them</a>, and the ban was lifted, on the condition that the city produce another report on the recycling potential of the foam (really). </p>

<p>Fast-forward to spring 2017, and a case of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu: the Sanitation Department issued its promised follow-up report, just as two new bills draw the same battle lines. Bronx Councilman Fernando Cabrera&apos;s bill would see polystyrene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2972218&amp;GUID=99CDCC68-B2EB-4FA1-B03D-CD6D9DCA7559&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">added to the city&apos;s official list of recyclable materials</a>, while Park Slope Councilman Brad Lander&apos;s bill would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3042790&amp;GUID=E29EC95F-E99F-43F6-B677-44B95197510B&amp;Options=ID|Text|&amp;Search=polystyrene">enshrine the Department of Sanitation&apos;s position</a> (again, but for real this time?). </p>

<p>&quot;Clamshell containers and cups are a staple in ethnic restaurants in my community,&quot; Cabrera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://www.wnyc.org/story/styrofoam-ban-surfaces-nyc-council-again/?hootPostID=1d0a9434c36f17588d951c1a1f391cbf">told WNYC</a> ahead of a city council hearing on his bill Friday. &quot;We hear from minority business owners all the time about increasing costs for them to do business here.&quot; </p>

<p>(Cabrera, WNYC reports, is one of a dozen City Council members who has received $39,095 in campaign contributions from Ariane Dart, wife of Dart Container CEO Robert Dart.) </p>

<p>Councilman Lander did not immediately comment on his bill, which would allow non-profits and non-chain restaurants with gross incomes under $500,000 to apply for financial hardship waivers. </p>

<p>Testifying in opposition to Cabrera&apos;s bill on Friday, Sanitation Department Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated that, &quot;The municipalities and programs that the Department researched tell a very clear story: Food-Service Foam is not capable of being recycled in an environmentally effective or an economically feasible manner.&quot; </p>

<p>Dart, meanwhile, has dug in its heels. Michael Westerfield, Dart&apos;s corporate director of recycling programs, told WNYC on Friday that the company will challenge the city&apos;s non-recyclable determination in court. &quot;It&#x2019;s wrong for struggling small businesses, restaurants and taxpayers,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203717/http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-york-city-reinstates-styrofoam-ban/">said</a>. </p>
