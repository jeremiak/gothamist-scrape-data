<p>Police are looking for a man who grabbed a woman from behind in Park Slope last week and made &quot;lewd&quot; motions with his pants down, according to a spokesperson for the department. The NYPD has yet to make any arrests one week after the alleged assault. </p>

<p>The victim, a 24-year-old woman from New Jersey, was stepping out of her car on 14th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues last Friday morning, around 5:30 a.m., when the man allegedly approached her. She was on her way to work at Union Street Market on Seventh Avenue, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>The man, pants down, allegedly grabbed the woman from behind and put his hand on her neck, police said. She managed to free herself and get back into her car, driving up to the corner of Seventh Avenue and calling one of her coworkers for help. </p>

<p>The man fled the scene, according to the police. One of the woman&apos;s coworkers said she saw him running towards Sixth Avenue on the south side of 14th Street. </p>

<p>&quot;I leave for work at 6 o&apos;clock in the morning, and I&apos;ve never, ever thought twice about walking to my car at that hour,&quot; Jen Maloney, a Park Slope resident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081332/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/16/park-slope-sex-attack/">told CBS</a>. </p>

<p>Police say the suspect is six feet tall, and was last seen wearing all black. </p>
