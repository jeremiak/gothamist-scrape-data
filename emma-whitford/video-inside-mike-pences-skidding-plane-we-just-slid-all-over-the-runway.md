<p>There were 48 passengers and crew members on board Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Mike Pence&apos;s chartered plane when it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/27/mike_pence_lga.php">slid off of the runway at La Guardia airport on Thursday night</a>, including his family, staff, secret service, and reporters. NBC reporter Vaughn Hillyard had the wherewithal to capture the moment of impact and its immediate aftermath, including a fellow reporter jolted awake, and a man pronouncing, &quot;I smell rubber.&quot; </p>

<p>Another woman can be heard saying, &quot;We just, like, slid all over the runway. Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It looks like we took out a good chunk of runway here,&quot; Fox reporter Dan Gallo said while exiting. Moments after the plane careened to a halt, one of the pilots, presumably, can be heard announcing, &quot;Everything is, uh, good here.&quot;</p>

<p>No one was injured during the rough landing, which is surely not a metaphor for anything, and reporters on board said Pence walked to the back of the plane to check on the press as soon as they came to a stop, updating the group that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://nypost.com/2016/10/27/plane-carrying-vp-candidate-mike-pence-skids-off-laguardia-runway/">mud had splashed</a> over the front windows of the cockpit, making it hard for the pilots to see. </p>

<p>&quot;He was calm. He came back to check on the press,&quot; CBS reporter Alan He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-plane-skids-off-runway-at-nycs-laguardia-airport/">told his outlet</a>. &quot;We had no idea we had skidded off the runway until Gov. Pence came to the back of the plane and said we may have done that.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Pence plane, a Boeing 737 Eastern Airlines charter painted with Trump&apos;s &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; slogan, touched down around 7:40 p.m. on Thursday en route from Fort Dodge, Iowa. Wheels hit the rain-slicked tarmac, and the pilot reportedly hit the breaks. Passengers and witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/28/ntsb-mike-pence-plane-laguardia/">told CBS</a> that the plane then began sliding sideways, and &quot;fishtailed&quot; to a stop near the Grand Central Parkway. Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye told reporters that the plane traveled about 7,000 feet before striking arrestor beds&#x2014;thin concrete tracks alongside the runway designed to crack and buckle under the weight of a runaway plane. According to the Port Authority, 80 arrestor beds were destroyed. </p>

<p>&quot;Basically, it&apos;s a thin veneer of concrete. It&apos;s just like going into quicksand, if you will. It&#x2019;s a breakaway concrete that collapses under the weight of the aircraft, and stops it,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/27/mike-pence-plane-laguardia/">said</a> CNN aviation analyst Miles O&#x2019;Brien. According to O&apos;Brien, if not for the arrestor beds, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s very likely this aircraft would be in the East River.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&quot;The arrestor beds served their purpose tonight,&quot; Foye <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://nypost.com/2016/10/27/plane-carrying-vp-candidate-mike-pence-skids-off-laguardia-runway/">said</a>. </p>

According to the outlet, reporters have been joking cryptically about shaky landings for the past few months. Touching down earlier Thursday, in Iowa, was particularly rough: </p>

<blockquote>The landing there &#x201C;was especially bad,&#x201D; according to one passenger. The plane &#x201C;bounced off the runway and then touched down a second time.&#x201D;

<p>&quot;It was a hard landing, it&apos;s always hard, right? But Iowa was extra hard, like people gasped,&#x201D; another passenger said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Reports of bad weather at La Guardia delayed the Pence camp on the tarmac in Iowa, leaving time for the VP candidate to play pickup football, just like a regular all-American guy you&apos;d like to get a beer with while his running mate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/trump_groping_us_open.php">gropes your wife</a>. </p>

<p>The Port Authority said that crews worked through Thursday night to remove Pence&apos;s plane from the runway. While the skid incident shut down the entire airport around 8:07 p.m., one runway reopened shortly thereafter. The second runway, where Pence&apos;s plan landed, reopened around 7:40 a.m. on Friday. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/10/28/ntsb-mike-pence-plane-laguardia/">CBS reports</a> that National Transportation Safety Board advisors will be at La Guardia on Friday examining the plane. &quot;Per the request of the NTSB, we are not going to speculate on the cause of the incident,&quot; Foye told reporters. </p>

<p>Residual delays are expected Friday, and the Port Authority is urging passengers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073010/https://twitter.com/PANYNJ/status/791848673118412800">contact their airlines</a>. </p>
