<p>Transit police arrested a Sudanese diplomat on Monday afternoon after observing him rub his crotch against a woman on the 4 train near Grand Central, according to the NYPD. Initial charges of sexual assault and forceable touching were dropped, however, when police confirmed 49-year-old Mohammad Abdalla Ali&apos;s diplomat status. </p>

<p>Ali, a finance attach&#xE9; for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101134207/https://www.un.int/sudan/">Sudanese Mission to the United Nations</a>, benefited from diplomatic immunity&#x2014;a policy that has protected diplomats from fines as innocuous as parking tickets and charges serious as rape in their host countries. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, officers saw Ali &quot;acting in a suspicious manner&quot; behind a 38-year-old woman on a northbound 4 train, shortly after 2:00 p.m. on Monday. The train had just pulled out of Grand Central Terminal. Following Ali&apos;s arrest, charges of forceable touching and sexual assault were voided. The case was referred to the State Department. </p>

<p>&quot;We are aware of allegations of a criminal act by a Sudanese diplomat that led to the involvement of the NYPD,&quot; said State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner in a statement. &quot;We are in touch with the NYPD and the Mayor&apos;s office so that we are able to take appropriate steps, as needed, to address this matter.&quot; </p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment; the Sudanese Mission also did not immediately comment. </p>

<p>Since 1978, diplomats have been legally immune from both criminal prosecution and lawsuits pertaining to their activities both on and off the job, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101134207/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/150546.pdf">Diplomatic Relations Act</a>. Al Jazeera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101134207/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/29/how-diplomats-accused-of-crimes-abuse-immunity.html">reported on the policy in 2015</a>, which is intended to protect diplomats from unfair trial in hostile countries. It came under fire that fall, when Majed Hassan Ashoor, first secretary at Delhi&apos;s Saudi Embassy, invoked the privilege after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101134207/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/world/asia/saudi-diplomat-accused-of-rape-has-left-india-government-says.html">allegedly beating and raping</a> two Nepali women who worked for him. &quot;The provisions are plainly antiquated and not fit for purpose in a modern era,&quot; Schona Jolly, an international human rights lawyer, told the outlet at the time. </p>

<p>Last fall in New York City, a German UN attach&#xE9; reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101134207/http://nypost.com/2016/11/04/diplomat-accused-of-punching-wife-in-nyc-flees-to-germany/">invoked immunity</a> after allegedly punching his wife in the face. </p>

<p>City Councilmember Rory Lancman introduced legislation in 2014, known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101134207/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1687955&amp;GUID=4407743B-2DCF-4C41-BB28-F22A3896D8A7&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=206">Diplomatic Immunity Notification Act</a>, that would require the NYPD to notify the City Council and Mayor&apos;s office of any incident in which a diplomat benefits from immunity. The council has yet to hold a hearing on the bill. </p>
