<p>An on-duty state trooper who rammed into an Audi at a rest station on the Garden State Parkway in the middle of the afternoon last month&#x2014;with twice the legal blood alcohol content limit&#x2014;told a responding officer that he was &quot;not drunk&quot; according to dash cam video released this week by New Jersey police. </p>

<p>Granted, when a police officer approaches you on the side of the road with a &quot;How are we doing?&quot; and your immediate response, without provocation, is &quot;I am not drunk,&quot; logic would suggest otherwise. </p>

<p>Sgt. First Class Michael Roadside (really) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155527/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/11/im_not_drunk_trooper_charged_with_dwi_says_in_dash.html#incart_most-read_">crashed into Kimberly Wilson&apos;s vehicle</a> around 2:00 p.m. on October 26th. According to Wilson, who can be heard on the dash cam audio, Roadside approached her car after the crash with his uniform on inside out and offered her $1,000 not to report him. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155527/http://abc7ny.com/news/video-shows-trooper-charged-with-dwi-professing-sobriety-blaming-prostate-procedure/1091792/">Wilson told WABC 7</a> that Roadside &quot;looked like he just got out of bed,&quot; adding, &quot;I&apos;m like, &apos;Where&apos;s your weapon?&apos; And he lifted his shirt up, and I could see he had the gun on him, and then a magazine fell on the ground. And when that happened, I lost it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had prostate surgery,&quot; Roadside tells Officer Matthew Durak in the video. &quot;I gotta get home.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; says Durak. &quot;Fair enough.&quot; </p>

<p>When Durak breathalyzed Roadside and read off the BAC of .16, the trooper finally admitted that he was in fact drunk, but not <em>that</em> drunk. In fact, &quot;I&apos;ve been way more drunk than that.&quot; </p>

<p>Roadside has since admitted to drinking nine beers that day on an empty stomach and has been suspended without pay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155527/http://www.nj.com/news/2015/11/state_trooper_charged_with_drunken_driving_was_twi.html#incart_article_small">according to the Star Ledger</a>. A cardboard case of Coors Light and two open containers were also found in his car.</p>
