<p>Thousands of pages of documents that City Hall initially withheld from the Department of Investigation were released this week, and investigators say they&apos;re relevant to an ongoing investigation into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091438/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/45_rivington_press_conference.php">$16.15 million deal</a> that lifted deed restrictions on a Lower East Side nursing home. In the months since the deed restriction was lifted, the building has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091438/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/45_rivington_press_conference.php">sold to luxury developers</a> who intend to build condominiums on the site. </p>

<p>On Tuesday the city also agreed to hand over, as per the DOI&apos;s written request, &quot;all digital information stored on City-owned computer hard drives&quot; that are &quot;assigned to or otherwise used by&quot; Mayor de Blasio, Deputy Mayor Anthony Shorris, Shorris&apos;s Chief of Staff Dominic Williams, and director of intergovernmental affairs Emma Wolfe. </p>

<p>According to the City Charter, &quot;every officer or employee of the City shall cooperate fully with the [DOI] Commissioner,&quot; who is &quot;authorized and empowered to make any study or investigation which in his opinion may be in the best interests of the city.&quot; </p>

<p>One initially-redacted internal memo, dated July 2014, includes a table of pros and cons in lifting the deed restriction on Rivington House, then owned by the nursing provider VillageCare. According to the memo, representatives from the Mayor&apos;s office met with the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS), which is empowered to lift deed restrictions, &quot;to discuss the potential drawbacks, benefits, or alternative uses&quot; if 45 Rivington&apos;s deed were to be lifted. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091438/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-officials-covering-deed-restriction-memos-article-1.2727068">The Daily News reports</a> that Shorris was among those briefed on the possible deed change. </p>

<p>The memo predicts that lifting the deed would &quot;remove AIDS services from the LES&quot; and that, if VillageCare got its way, &quot;many non-profits would want to sell high-value deed restrictions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This memo provided vital information showing that City Hall was involved in the decision-making process on Rivington House and is therefore directly relevant to City Hall&apos;s involvement in the Rivington matter,&quot; wrote DOI Commissioner Mark G. Peters in a July 21 letter to Corporation Counsel Zachary Carter, demanding the redacted documents in full.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="070916rivingtonhouse.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091438im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/070916rivingtonhouse.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Rivington House (Emma Whitford / Gothamist) </i></div> <p></p>

<p>The Department of Investigation&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091438/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/14/doi_rivington_house_report.php">initial report on the Rivington deal</a>, released earlier this month, already revealed that Shorris, de Blasio&apos;s second-in-command, and other top City Hall officials were informed of the Rivington deal before it was made official. This, despite Mayor de Blasio&apos;s repeated assertions that he was in the dark. (In April, the mayor told reporters that, &quot;If [members of my administration] had informed me [of the agreement] I would&apos;ve said &apos;don&apos;t do it.&apos;&quot;)</p>

<p>Still, the latest data dump seems to contradict an earlier statement from City Hall spokesman Eric Phillips, after the DOI&apos;s initial Rivington report: that &quot;the Administration fully cooperated with the DOI, provided every single document and every single interview requested by the DOI.&quot; </p>

<p>Another initially-redacted memo discusses the deed restriction lift on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091438/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/13/harlem_lot_developers.php">property held by the Dance Theater of Harlem</a> at St. Nicholas Avenue and 152nd Street. DCAS accepted $875,000 to lift a 70s-era restriction on that lot, which was sold to a developer for  $3.1 million last May. </p>

<p>Peters, the DOI Commissioner, called the city&apos;s assumption that such a memo would not be relevant to the Rivington investigation &quot;inappropriate and incorrect.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I am pleased that the Law Department decided to comply with the law,&quot; Peters added in a statement Tuesday. &quot;And, I am proud of the DOI staff who doggedly pursued access to these records so DOI can fully investigate the matter at hand.&quot; </p>

<p>Peters, who served as de Blasio&#x2019;s campaign treasurer in 2013, recused himself from the Rivington investigation this spring over potential conflict of interest. The DOI stated this week that regardless, Peters &quot;is not recused from the broader issue regarding enforcement of DOI&#x2019;s statutory powers.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s office did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but Phillips <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091438/http://nypost.com/2016/07/26/nursing-home-probe-pits-city-agencies-against-each-other/">told the NY Post</a> this week that the additional document dump wasn&apos;t relevant to the investigation. </p>

<p>&quot;The Law Department has now provided access and information significantly above our legal obligation and far beyond any useful scope of DOI&apos;s review,&quot; he said. </p>
