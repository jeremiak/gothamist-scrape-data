<p>The NYPD confirmed early Monday morning that no shots were fired at JFK Terminals 1 and 8 on Sunday night, contrary to reports earlier in the evening that had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430051324/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/jfk_airport_evacuation.php">prompted the Port Authority to evacuate both terminals</a>. One police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430051324/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/no-confirmation-shots-fired-jfk-airport-new-york-authorities-say-n630666">told NBC news Monday</a> that the sound of people cheering and clapping for the Olympics may have been mistaken for gunshots, but Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo could not immediately confirm this. According to the news outlet, police said that the airport went into high alert when a woman exiting a plane said she had heard gunshots. </p>

<p>Both terminals reopened around 12:45 a.m. on Monday after a harrowing NYPD response: </p>

<p>Referencing the NBC report, the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430051324/http://nypost.com/2016/08/15/fans-cheering-for-usain-bolt-likely-caused-jfk-shooting-scare/">noted</a> that Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt won the 100-meter dash at 9:30 p.m., concurrent with the first reports of shots fired. In the video above, a loud bang is heard and people can be seen huddling on the ground as NYPD Emergency Services Unit officers pass through with weapons drawn, screaming at everyone to get down on the ground and stay there.</p>

<p>People waiting for flights out of Terminal 8 were evacuated from the airport shortly after 9:30 p.m., according to the Port Authority, and a separate report of gunshots prompted an evacuation of Terminal 1 around 10:15. Multiple flights scheduled to land at JFK were diverted to Buffalo. By 11:55 p.m., Special Ops had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430051324/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/jfk_airport_evacuation.php">tweeted</a> that &quot;It appears that no shots have been fired.&quot; </p>

<p>According to social media reports, airport staff and police did not clarify why the evacuation was necessary. One person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430051324/https://twitter.com/archcomix/status/765007379800915968">tweeted</a> that the NYPD simply told him: &quot;it&apos;s not safe to stay here,&quot; without giving further information.</p>

<p>&quot;If you&apos;re forgetting anything, it&apos;s not worth your life, everyone move now!&#x201D; one officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430051324/http://nypost.com/2016/08/14/shots-reportedly-fired-at-jfk-airport/">reportedly yelled</a> during the evacuation. </p>

<p>One video shows people evacuating Terminal 8 with their hands in the air, under direction of a woman speaking over the intercom. Everyone is directed to leave their bags behind, and not to touch their cellphones. At one point, the &apos;90s pop song &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170430051324/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHsip5xOenQ">Here&apos;s Where The Story Ends</a>&quot; by The Sundays can be heard playing faintly over the speaker system. </p>

<p>As of Monday morning, there are no reported injuries or arrests related to the evacuation. </p>
