<p>The <em>M. Butterfly</em> author, a Fort Greene resident, was walking home on South Portland Street between Lafayette and DeKalb Avenues with a load of groceries just before 9:00 p.m. on Sunday when an unknown assailant slashed him in the back of the neck. </p>

<p>Hwang did not catch sight of the attacker, but had the wherewithal to walk the three and a half blocks to Brooklyn Hospital&#x2014;leaving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032443/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/120315blood2.jpg">a gnarly trail of blood</a> that stretched, according to our tipster, about ten feet. </p>

<p>&quot;Thanks to the excellent work of the doctors at Brooklyn Hospital and Mount Sinai, I&apos;m now home and expected to make a full recovery,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032443/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/m-butterfly-playwright-slashed-neck-brooklyn-home-article-1.2453619">he said</a> earlier this week. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="12415_Stabbing.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032443im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/12415_Stabbing.jpeg" width="300" height="255"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> (via DCPI)</i></div> The NYPD has since confirmed that the suspect did not say anything to Hwang, much less take anything from his person. Surveillance footage shows a person with his or her back turned, wearing a backpack and white sneakers.<p></p>

<p>Hwang teaches at Columbia University, and is a three-time Tony nominee, a three-time OBIE Award winner, and a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist.</p>
