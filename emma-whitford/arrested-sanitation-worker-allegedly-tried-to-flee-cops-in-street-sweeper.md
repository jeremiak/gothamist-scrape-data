<p>Roman Protas, 38, was observed in front of Saint Frances de Chantal Parish in Borough Park shortly before 9:00 a.m., throwing &quot;unknown objects&quot; at a crucifix statue, an NYPD spokesman said. Responding officers caught up with Protas several blocks east on Avenue L. The worker allegedly fled when they flashed their lights. </p>
