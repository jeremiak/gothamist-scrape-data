<p>According to the NYPD, 20-year-old Nehoray Shabbot of Worcester, Massachusetts allegedly kicked and punched Offen inside of 770 Eastern Parkway, the headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitches, on Saturday September 12th, causing bruising to Offen&apos;s back, buttocks, and leg. Offen filed a report with the 71st Precinct after the incident, alleging that Shabbot called him a &quot;fag&quot; and a &quot;homo&quot; in Yiddish. It&apos;s unclear what Offen was doing at the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015035217/http://nypost.com/2015/12/14/you-homo-hasidic-man-charged-with-hate-crime-after-chase-of-cross-dressing-howard-stern-guest/">The Post reports</a> that Offen had a second interaction with Shabbot this past Saturday&#x2014;Shabbot allegedly chased Offen along Eastern Parkway around 11:00 p.m. yelling &quot;You homo, I&#x2019;m going to cut off your schmeckle!&#x201D; according to the Post (shmeckle being Yiddish for penis). </p>

<p>71st Precinct officers arrested Shabbot around 11:00 p.m. on Saturday December 12th, and charged him with assault as a hate crime and aggravated assault as a hate crime.</p>

<p>Offen, who has left many Stern fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015035217/https://twitter.com/kumerle/status/675017729284423684">asking after him</a> in recent years, was spotted this February demanding a return for a long-since-purchased item at the Kmart on Astor Place. </p>

<p>&quot;I love the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015035217/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wack_Pack">wack pack</a> though he [Offen] is a pretty horrifying person really,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015035217/http://slumgoddess.blogspot.com/2015/02/elegant-elliot-offen-sighting.html">wrote the uploader</a>. &quot;I wanted to get a pic with him but he was too busy calling them all names and wishing cancer on them to bother with me.&quot; </p>
