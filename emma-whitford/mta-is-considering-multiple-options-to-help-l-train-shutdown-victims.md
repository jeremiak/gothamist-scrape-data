title: MTA Is Considering Multiple Options To Help L Train Shutdown Victims
---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="060716ltrain.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/060716ltrain.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> A fun preview (Billy Devine). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Now that the MTA has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/25/talkin_l_train_shutdown_blues.php">confirmed its decision</a> to suspend L train service between Brooklyn and Manhattan for 18 months starting in January 2019, the authority says its shifting focus to the alternative service routes that will eventually serve the L&apos;s 225,000 weekday riders. </p>

<p>&quot;We have time,&quot; MTA President Ronnie Hakim assured her Board of Directors at a monthly meeting on Monday. &quot;We have time to put a thorough plan together and get it right.&quot; </p>

<p>To date, the MTA has confirmed that it will expand service on the J, G and M trains during the L shutdown, with additional subway cars and more frequent rush hour trains (keep in mind that expanded M service will require extensive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/18/f_the_m_to_the_l.php">M line closures</a> for repairs starting next summer). Other ideas that have been floated&#x2014;expanded ferry service, B39 bus service over the Williamsburg bridge, a bus-heavy or even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/07/car_free_14th_street.php">car-free 14th Street</a>&#x2014;will require coordination with state and city agencies, like the Department of Transportation. </p>

<p>According to an MTA spokeswoman, all of the above are being considered. However, the bus and ferry proposals will take longer to refine because they&apos;re not solely within the MTA&apos;s jurisdiction (the DOT has said it &quot;looks forward to working closely with the MTA regarding all options&quot;). </p>

<p>Hakim also said Monday that she anticipates that the application process for L train repair contracts will be competitive, and that the authority will use financial incentives to speed up the process&#x2014;a tactic that shaved more than a month off of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/15/r_train_back_subway_brooklyn.php#photo-1">repair work to the Montague Tunnel on the R line</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ll have the opportunity to challenge the teams that are negotiating on this project,&quot; Hakim said. &quot;We will be in a position to pay incentives for early completion. On the Montague tunnel... that [14 month] closure was closer to 13 months.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re hoping that the 18 month closure can also be brought [down],&quot; she added. &quot;If the contractor is late, there will be significant damages.&quot; </p>

<p>John Raskin of the Riders Alliance said Monday that while expanded service on the M, J and G lines is crucial, he&apos;d like the MTA to consider expanded service on additional intersecting lines.</p>

<p>&quot;A lot of the press coverage has focused on Williamsburg, but remember that people [who ride the L] <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/27/canarsie_l_train_mta.php">also live in Canarsie</a> and East New York, and can switch to the A or C at Broadway Junction,&quot; Raskin said. </p>

<p>He also emphasized the close proximity of the Livonia Avenue L and Junius Street 3 stations in Brownsville. There&apos;s currently no free transfer between the two, and while the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/28/subway_mta_second_ave.php">has agreed to build a connecting bridge</a>, advocates challenge that timeline. </p>

<p>&quot;We have pushed to begin allowing free transfers before [the L shutdown],&quot; Raskin said. &quot;That would be a small but noticeable difference for people who live in East New York and Canarsie.&quot; </p>

<p>Presented with the Livonia-Junius free transfer suggestion, an MTA spokeswoman said Monday that it was one of the proposals being considered. </p>

<p>&quot;MTA plans to work closely with the City and State to develop routes and determine service levels needed to accommodate projected ridership,&quot; the authority stated on Monday. </p>

<p>In the meantime, we can keep daydreaming about some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132007/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/boom_problem_solved.php#photo-1">more fanciful solutions</a>. </p>
