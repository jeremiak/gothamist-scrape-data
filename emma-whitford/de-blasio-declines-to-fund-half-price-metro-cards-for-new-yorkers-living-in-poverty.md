<p>After months of advocacy from transit riders and public defenders, Mayor Bill de Blasio declined this week to fund a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/25/half_price_metrocards.php">$50 million pilot program</a> for half-price MetroCards. De Blasio has consistently indicated his unwillingness to fund multiple versions of the proposal in this year&apos;s fiscal budget, despite advocates&apos; insistence that doing so would reduce fare beating arrests and help poor New Yorkers get to work and school. </p>

<p>&quot;I lament that we were not able to come to an agreement to support poverty-stricken New Yorkers struggling to pay for public transportation,&quot; stated City Council Transportation Committee Chair Ydanis Rodriguez on Tuesday. </p>

<p>&quot;For those that choose to jump the turnstile because they can&apos;t afford a ride, they put themselves at risk of entering the criminal justice system, or, if undocumented, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/25/nypd_turnstile_jumping_deportation.php">at risk of deportation</a>,&quot; he added, pledging to continue fighting for reduced fares. </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA is the responsibility of the state and they should consider funding the program,&quot; a spokeswoman for Mayor de Blasio told us ahead of the budget deadline. </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA already makes a substantial commitment to low-income City riders,&quot; countered MTA Spokeswoman Beth DeFalco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/metrocard_reduced_fare.php">in an email last fall</a>, referring to programs like Access-A-Ride and free fares for students. </p>

<p>A recent study [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/http://b.3cdn.net/nycss/7169ea001b71493ce9_lvm6b2ptw.pdf">PDF</a>] released by transit reform advocates found that more than a quarter of low-income working New Yorkers were unable to afford subway or bus fare at least once in 2015. The NYPD arrested 5,137 New Yorkers for fare evasion between January and mid-March this year, according to the Riders Alliance, 90 percent of whom are black or Latino. Last year, fare evasion was NYC&apos;s second most common arrest charge, resulting in nearly 26,000 arrests.</p>

<p>In order to hammer home the scale of arrests, Queens Councilman Rory Lancman today announced in-draft legislation that would require the NYPD to regularly report granular data on fare evasion arrests and summonses&#x2014;data it has thus far reportedly been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170522/financial-district/mta-subway-fair-fares-swipe-it-forward-police-nypd">reluctant to share with the MTA Board</a>. </p>

<p>Lancman would like the NYPD to report the number of arrests and summonses each month, with breakdowns by race and individual subway station. </p>

<p>&quot;I think it will paint a very unflattering picture,&quot; the councilman told Gothamist on Wednesday. &quot;Overwhelmingly fare evasion is a crime of poverty. People don&apos;t risk arrest for not paying a couple dollars [for] fare, unless that couple dollars really means a lot to them.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It begs the question of whether we should be prosecuting jumping turnstiles as a crime, whereas, when I don&apos;t pay the parking meter, I just get a ticket,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>Lancman has urged de Blasio to move all low-level, nonviolent quality of life offenses from the criminal code to the civil code, and hopes this latest legislation will help the case. Though the City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/25/nyc_decriminalized_low_level_offenses.php">passed legislation to this effect</a> last spring, beat cops still have discretion, and can choose to issue a criminal summons if they see fit. </p>

<p>NYPD Transit Chief Joseph Fox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/https://twitter.com/NYPDTransit/status/834084696166367233">tweeted this winter</a> that 73 percent of people stopped for fair evasion are issued a summons and not arrested. Cops are instructed to prioritize repeat offenders and individuals with open warrants for arrest, according to City Hall. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/27/sanctuary_city_nyc_trump.php">resistant</a> to decriminalizing turnstile jumping. As for Lancman&apos;s legislation, spokesman Austin Finan told Gothamist Wednesday that, &quot;The NYPD has taken real and meaningful steps to increase transparency through new tools and technology like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607233501/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/compstat_2_nypd_crime_map.php">CompStat 2.0.</a>,&quot; and, &quot;City Hall and the department will review this bill as part of that ongoing effort.&quot; </p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson said the department &quot;looks forward to reviewing the bill to determine if we are able capture and provide this data in the way the bill envisions.&quot;</p>
