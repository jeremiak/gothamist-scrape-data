<p>Two generations of tenants rallied in front of 80 New York Avenue in Crown Heights on Monday morning to protest what they say is an ongoing campaign of harassment by the building&apos;s management company. A small handful of long-term residents in the eight unit building are midway through their second winter without heat, having refused multiple buyout offers. Their neighbors, meanwhile, have heat, stainless steel fixtures, fresh paint and renovated kitchens and bathrooms. But the latter say they are being grossly, and illegally, overcharged.</p>

<p>Mary St.Angelo, 22, moved into a first floor apartment last fall. Like many of the tenants in the building&apos;s renovated units, she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228004814/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/15/crown_heights_landlord_battle.php">co-signed her apartment&apos;s lease with total strangers</a>. She and her four roommates pay between $750 and $875 each per month, or $4,100 combined. </p>

<p>More and more, landlords across gentrifying Brooklyn are renting out individual bedrooms as part of a strategy to fill vacancies quickly and increase profits. Luckily, St.Angelo said, her roommates get along. All are recent college graduates, and three work in the performing arts. </p>

<p>&quot;We found out that our problems were minuscule compared to our neighbors&apos;,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>When Gold Management bought 80 New York Avenue in December 2014 for $2.3 million, the eight unit building was entirely rent-stabilized. Most of the tenants had lived there for decades, and had seen their rents&#x2014;which ranged from about $575 to $1,200 per month&#x2014;increase incrementally. </p>

<p>Public Advocate Letitia James addressed the rampant tenant harassment in Crown Heights, spreading east from the coffee shops, bars and yoga studios of Franklin Avenue. &quot;We were focusing on the displacement [on Franklin Avenue]... about five years ago. And now here we are in front of this building,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;We are losing the diversity in Crown Heights. We are losing the diversity in central Brooklyn.&quot; </p>

<p>Gold Management ripped out 80 New York Avenue&apos;s central boiler during renovations. They then installed bulky, individual HVAC systems in the un-renovated units, which tenants say are inoperable. (Altering rent-stabilized tenants&apos; utilities requires state permission; the Division of Housing and Community Renewal is currently investigating). </p>

<p>Lisa Mathis, 55, lives across the hall from St.Angelo. &quot;As you can see we&apos;re an eclectic group of tenants,&quot; she told the crowd on Monday. &quot;We have young urban professionals, we have the students, we have civil service employees like myself, we have retirees. We have given to this community and continue to give to this community. So we&apos;re not asking for anything we&apos;re not entitled to.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s ridiculous that I leave my home and it&apos;s the same temperature outside as it is inside,&quot; she added. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228004814/http://www.mfy.org/">MFY Legal Services</a> is representing the tenants pro-bono in a lawsuit alleging illegal deregulation and rent overcharges. The Department of Buildings and Housing Preservation and Development are also aware of ongoing issues in the building. There are 26 open HPD violations on the property, according to that agency&apos;s website, including exposed electrical wires and improperly installed heating units. DOB issued an outstanding $1,600 fine for the un-permitted boiler removal in December 2015. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re really trying to put the pressure on these agencies,&quot; said tenant Max Cohen. &quot;All they do is say, &apos;There should be heat.&apos; Great. They did an inspection, but people still don&apos;t have heat.&quot; </p>

<p>HPD and DOB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the outstanding violations; DHCR did not immediately comment on the ongoing lawsuit. </p>

<p>Gold Management also did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Golds&apos; attorney, Arun Perinbasekar, has countered in court papers that 80 New York Avenue was &quot;severely&quot; run down when his clients purchased it, justifying extensive renovations and the subsequent rent increases. </p>

<p>The tenants of 80 New York Avenue have been organizing since last January, and, retained their attorney with help from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228004814/http://www.crownheightstenantunion.org/">Crown Heights Tenant Union</a>. They&apos;ve rallied outside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228004814/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/crown-heights-tenants-sue-landlords-unbearable-conditions-article-1.2664843">Brooklyn Supreme Court</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228004814/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/crown_heights_protest.php#photo-6">in front of their building</a>. Last June, they hung bright green and orange signs in most of the street-facing windows that broadcast an eye-catching message: &quot;S-L-U-M-L-O-R-D: D-O-N-&apos;T R-E-N-T H-E-R-E.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They don&apos;t care about anybody,&quot; 76-year-old Bessie Stanton said of Gold Management. Mathis&apos;s aunt, she also refused a buyout. &quot;It&apos;s not just [the old tenants], it&apos;s the whole building. They&apos;re in the business for money. They don&apos;t care who they cheat.&quot; </p>

<p>Alexis Garnett, 22, one of the newer tenants, said that the building-wide organizing has been a pleasant surprise. </p>

<p>&quot;My last apartment we had similar issues with the gas... and nobody in the building talked to each other,&quot; she said. &quot;We tried to reach out to other neighbors and it was all closed doors.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>[Update 4:45 p.m.]:</strong> Spokespeople for both HPD and DOB said that their agencies are monitoring the landlord&apos;s progress on fixing open violations. According to HPD, there is currently a court order to correct two open violations for lack of heat. </p>
