<p>Two men and two women were arrested Tuesday evening after police were tipped off to a Facebook Live video of them with BB guns inside a rented room at the boutique Gramercy Park Hotel, according to the NYPD and multiple media reports. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202101434/https://www.facebook.com/Queen.Maxxinee?hc_ref=NEWSFEED">Facebook Live video</a> posted Tuesday by 25-year-old Maxine Hansen, one of the women, appears to be the video that tipped cops off. In it, Hansen mugs in front of a hotel room mirror and shares footage of the mini bar, two of her companions, and what appear to be at least five BB guns strewn on the hotel bed. </p>

<p>At one point Hansen says, &quot;Gonna catch a body,&quot; (slang for murder) and then, panning over the BB guns, &quot;Those are play guns.&quot; She also addresses the BB guns in the comments, writing, &quot;Yeah I really have play guns in a penthouse.&quot; </p>

<p>When Hansen and one of the men in the room open the liquor-stocked mini-fridge, she declares, &quot;I don&apos;t even think Donald Trump be livin&apos; like this.&quot; </p>

<p>Police received a call about possible guns and a bomb inside the Gramercy Park Hotel at 2 Lexington Avenue around 4:20 p.m. on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for the department. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202101434/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161129/gramercy/facebook-live-of-group-with-guns-inside-hotel-leads-4-arrests-sources">DNAInfo reports</a> that police then called hotel security. Security guards responded to the 11th floor hallway and heard someone through the door say &quot;be careful with that, you can get shot,&quot; according to the outlet.</p>

Cops also recovered six BB guns and drug paraphernalia, but no actual guns, according to the NYPD.    <p></p>

<p>Along with Hansen, police arrested Firas Yousef, 32, Bassem Yousef, 30, and Ashley Mueller, 22. All four were preliminarily charged with criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of a controlled substance, criminal use of drug paraphernalia, and criminal possession of marijuana. Their arraignment is pending.  </p>

<p>Possession of an air pistol or rifle is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202101434/https://www.nysrpa.org/files/nyc-admincode.pdf">illegal under NYC administrative code</a> unless the owner has an annual license &quot;from the police commissioner of the city authorizing such sale and possession.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We are fully cooperating with the authorities and as this is an ongoing investigation are unable to provide additional information at this time,&quot; said Gramercy Park Hotel General Manager Daniel Entenberg. &quot;The safety and security of our guests remains our priority. Any inquiries should be directed to the NYPD.&quot; </p>

<p>Hansen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mueller and the Yousefs could not be reached. </p>
