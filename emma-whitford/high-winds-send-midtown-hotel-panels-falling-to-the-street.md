<p>Traffic was rerouted from Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street Monday morning, after three decorative exterior panels fell from the facade of a Sheraton Hotel in Midtown. No injuries were reported. </p>

<p>The panels fell from the hotel at 811 7th Avenue shortly before 10:45 p.m. on Sunday, according to the FDNY. The Department of Buildings confirmed that a section of curtain wall paneling dislodged, prompting a stability inspection at the site. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the hotel said that the panels were &quot;torn loose&quot; from the exterior of the 44th floor as a result of high winds.</p>

<p>The MTA has altered several Manhattan bus routes as a result. Since 8:00 this morning, M70, M20 and M10 buses have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030741/http://www.mta.info/status/bus/M1-M116/24208731">detoured</a> around 7th Avenue and 53rd Street. Riders are advised to expect extra travel time. </p>

<p>&quot;Fortunately no one was injured and the panels are not structural,&quot; said a W Hotels spokeswoman in a statement. &quot;The hotel will be immediately installing safety pedestrian walkways on 7th Avenue, conducting an inspection of the remaining panels and determining repair steps. In the meantime, the hotel is using its 53rd Street entrance.&quot; </p>

<p>We have reached out to the DOB for additional comment and will update accordingly. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A spokesman for the Department of Buildings confirmed that streets &quot;in the immediate vicinity&quot; of the hotel, including Seventh Avenue, &quot;will remain closed until our engineering investigation is complete and it is safe to restore the flow of traffic.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the DOB, two 5&apos; x 9&apos;  lightweight aluminum panels fell on Sunday night, as well as a 2&apos; x 2&apos; corner panel. DOB and private engineers will access the remaining panels via swing scaffold, and repair them &quot;if necessary.&quot; <br>
