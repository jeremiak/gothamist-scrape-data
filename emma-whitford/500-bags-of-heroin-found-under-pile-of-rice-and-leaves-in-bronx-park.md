<p>Parks Department employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312210019/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-probe-heroin-stash-ended-buried-bronx-park-article-1.2451130">came across</a> about 500 glassine bags of heroin in University Woods Park in University Heights on Sunday morning. The bags were conspicuous, only partially covered by leaves and branches and mixed with white rice&#x2014;likely in an effort to keep moisture out of the powder. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the discovery was made around 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, near the corner of Cedar and Sedgwick Avenues. In addition to the alleged drugs, workers also found a box cutter, and two cell phones. Officers have since taken control of the findings as evidence. </p>

<p>Geoffrey Croft of NYC Park Advocates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312210019/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2015/11/500-bags-of-heroin-found-in-bronx-park.html">referred to the three-acre park</a> as &quot;notorious,&quot; and a &quot;dumping ground&quot; due to lack of maintenance and short-staffing. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Parks said that the department is committed to keeping its parks safe and enjoyable across the city. <br>
