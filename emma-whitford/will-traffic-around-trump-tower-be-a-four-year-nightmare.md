<p>The ten Sanitation Department trucks that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/08/trump_tower_garbage_wall.php#photo-1">pulled up to Trump Tower</a> on election day, lining Fifth Avenue from 56th Street to 57th Street, didn&apos;t rev up and pull away when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/trump_president.php">shocking news</a> of Trump&apos;s victory came through early Tuesday morning. To the contrary, security around Trump&apos;s eponymous abode is doubling down. The trucks are part of a security mechanism that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/trump_protest_march_nyc.php#photo-1">tens of thousands of protesters</a> encountered on Wednesday night. Also yesterday, police and Secret Service agents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/nypd_trump_tower_security.php">barricaded 56th Street</a> between Fifth and Madison Avenues&#x2014;a blockade against any explosive-laden vehicles. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/faa-establishes-no-fly-zone-trump-tower-article-1.2867795">no-fly zone is in place</a> overhead until January 21st. </p>

<p>An anonymous source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/trump-tower-face-major-security-challenges-nyc-article-1.2866833">told the Daily News this week</a> that heightened security at Trump Tower is the new normal for &quot;as long Trump is in office.&quot; And while the NYPD declined to elaborate&#x2014;&quot;we do not discuss the specifics of security&quot;&#x2014;transit expert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://gothamist.com/tags/gridlocksam">Sam &quot;Gridlock&quot; Schwartz</a>, who served as the DOT&apos;s Chief Engineer in the 1990s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161110/midtown/trump-president-traffic-jam-gridlock">is predicting</a> that between barricades and protests, the impact on Midtown traffic will be significant. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;d say from now until Jan 21, 2021 Fifth Avenue will have one or more lanes closed for security reasons every day,&quot; Schwartz told Gothamist. &quot;Even when he&apos;s not in town there will always be a police detail there.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If you go to the Stock Exchange, at Broadway and Hall, there&apos;s been a permanent police detail there since 9/11,&quot; he added. &quot;You&apos;re going to see something similar here.&quot; </p>

<p>The closures will likely run between 55th and 59th Streets, according to Schwartz. &quot;56th, 57th, 58th and 59th Streets are all access roads to the Queensboro bridge, so you can see how overloaded the streets will get,&quot; he said. &quot;And that means more people will use the Queens Midtown Tunnel. All of the streets are now overloaded, so they&apos;ll be jammed even further.&quot; </p>

<p>The impact will extend beyond taxis, Ubers and private cars. &quot;Fifth Avenue is a major express bus street,&quot; Schwartz added. &quot;Lots of buses, particularly from the Bronx, come down. Plus local buses.&quot; The M1, M2, M3, and M4 and M5 buses run on Fifth Avenue, and the M31 and and M57 buses run crosstown on 57th Street. This morning, NYC got a dose of public transit woes in the area. </p>

<p>Finally, Schwartz predicts Trump Tower will remain a popular site for protests, like the one that shut down Fifth Avenue traffic last night. Already, a large one has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/trump_protest_nyc.php">been planned for Saturday</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s far more easily accessible than the White House is for protests, and from a media point of view it&apos;s just as visible,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be just as much tension. And you&apos;re likely to aggravate more people if you have your demonstration in Manhattan as opposed to Washington DC.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio also anticipated future protests during a Thursday press conference. &quot;The NYPD will come up with a plan, but there&apos;s a clear position in this country that we let people protest, so protestors shouldn&apos;t be moved too far away [from the tower],&quot; he said.</p>

<p>But the mayor predicted the gridlock will die down in a few months, post-inauguration. &quot;It&apos;s a challenge but not an overwhelming challenge,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;We&apos;re talking about the next few months.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Look at the bright side,&quot; he added. &quot;The holidays are coming up and Midtown will be all messed up anyway.&quot; </p>

<p>Last week, Secret Service sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://nypost.com/2016/11/07/trump-shouldnt-stay-in-penthouse-if-elected-secret-service/">told the NY Post</a> that they &quot;strongly recommend&quot; a President Trump spend little time in the middle of Manhattan, inside a building frequented by tourists and other residents. &quot;He&apos;s not liked,&quot; one source said. &quot;So there&apos;s the concern of someone taking a shot at him.&quot; </p>

<p>De Blasio said Thursday that the possibility of Trump living in Trump Tower as president would be &quot;untenable&#x201D; given the realities of how governing works today. </p>

<p>But Trump, who is <em>not</em> a man known for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trump-campaign-final-days.html">seeking or taking advice</a>, has a documented fondness for his gilded Trump Tower penthouse. This is the guy, after all, who spared no expense to fly home to NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044858/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-luxury-jet_us_57e6bc0ee4b08d73b8319f15"><em>every night</em></a> on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>The Department of Transportation deferred comment on any traffic pattern changes to the NYPD; the MTA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on alternate bus routes. </p>
