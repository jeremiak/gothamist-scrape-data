<p>To the ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://www.fobconeyisland.com/">dismay</a> of many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/https://savetheboardwalk.wordpress.com/">locals</a>, sections of the Coney Island Boardwalk, which was built beam by rainforest-wood beam in 1923, have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/17/concrete_and_plastic_coney_island_b.php">replaced over the years</a> with a mixture of recycled plastic and concrete.</p>

<p>This week, in an effort to block any future Parks Department plans to replace weathered wood with brute plastic (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/coney_island_boardwalk_to_become_co.php">concretewalk</a>, anyone?), the City Council passed a resolution urging the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/home/home.shtml">Landmarks Preservation Committee (LPC)</a> to impose scenic landmark status on the boardwalk. </p>

<p>&quot;I did not anticipate this becoming such an issue with the administration, because many people thought [the boardwalk] was already a landmark,&quot; said Councilmember Mark Treyger, who sponsored today&apos;s resolution and has been opposing alterations to the boardwalk for years. </p>

<p>&quot;My argument is bigger than concrete versus wood,&quot; he added. &quot;This is a historic structure.&quot;</p>

<p>The Parks Department has long argued that the alternate materials are more storm-resistant and environmentally friendly than hardwood, and a Parks spokesperson emphasized today that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/19/long_road_to_repair_for_hurricane_s.php">Hurricane Sandy</a> repairs were recently completed, and that no future alterations are planned. </p>

<p>&quot;The Coney Island Boardwalk is complete and open to the public, and is stronger and more resilient than ever before,&quot; said Parks Spokeswoman Maeri Ferguson in a statement. &quot;The city has a long-standing policy of reducing the use of tropical hardwoods. In fact, to reconstruct the entire boardwalk with tropical hardwoods would destroy 45,200 acres of tropical rainforest&#x2014;the equivalent of roughly 34,000 football fields&#x2014;and contribute to the very climate change that destroyed the boardwalk in the first place.&quot;</p>

<p>Local advocates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/https://www.change.org/p/keep-the-boards-in-the-coney-island-boardwalk-no-concrete-and-save-the-rainforests?recruiter=401906104&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share_twitter_responsive">have petitioned</a> for alternative &quot;sustainable domestic hardwoods&quot; like Black Locust or White Oak on the surface of the deck, supported by recycled lumber. </p>

<p>&quot;Basically what they&apos;ve tried to do is hide behind a non-existent sustainability issue,&quot; said Geoffrey Croft of NYC Parks Advocates, who helped file a futile lawsuit against boardwalk alterations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/17/concrete_and_plastic_coney_island_b.php">back in 2012</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;The concrete is chipping, and it gets hotter during the summer,&quot; he added. &quot;Wood doesn&apos;t freeze in the winter time, and it&apos;s cooler during the summer because it allows air to pass through. Plastic is plastic. It gets slippery when it&apos;s wet, it doesn&apos;t have the same feeling or smell. It&apos;s not wood, you know?&quot; </p>

<p>The LPC rejected Treyger&apos;s bid for landmark status last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-coney-island-20150427-story.html#page=1">reportedly arguing</a> that the two-mile stretch is already too altered from its original state to merit the designation. </p>

<p>This time around, it&apos;s worth noting that the City Council&apos;s vote is purely advisory. &quot;I understand that the Park&apos;s Department advisement will weigh heavily on the LPC&apos;s decision,&quot; Treyger admitted, adding that he thinks the council vote &quot;sent a very strong message.&quot;</p>

<p>The LPC could not immediately be reached for comment, but is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/05/4/new-battle-in-war-over-coney-island-boardwalk.html">reportedly</a> reviewing its previous decision regarding landmark status. In the meantime, a beloved piece of Coney Island&apos;s history will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027172032/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/03/coney_island_boardwalk_becomes_furn.php">set you back $7,200</a>. </p>
