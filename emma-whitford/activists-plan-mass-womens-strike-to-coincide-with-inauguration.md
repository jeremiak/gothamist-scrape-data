<p>As organizers across the country coordinate bus and carpool trips for the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/30/nyc_dc_guide_to_march_on_washington.php">Women&apos;s March on Washington</a>, a local feminist group is urging women to abstain from all labor&#x2014;physical, as well as emotional&#x2014;for two full days at the end of the month, starting on January 20th, Inauguration Day. The goal, organizers say, is to demand protections that the President-elect and GOP lawmakers openly oppose: full access <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/16/ny_abortion_trump_regime.php">to birth control and abortion</a>, as well as a $15 minimum wage, universal childcare, and paid parental leave. In response to Trump&apos;s degradation of women, immigrants, and the disabled, strikers will also demand an end to bigotry and harassment. </p>

<p>&quot;This is a way for women to express their disappointment and also show power,&quot; said Paulina Davis, a Women&apos;s Strike organizer with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://www.womensliberation.org/">National Women&apos;s Liberation</a>. &quot;We as women collectively have the power to disrupt workplace and home life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If you can&apos;t get on a bus to go to D.C., if you are not able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/21/womens_march_trump_nyc.php">march in NYC</a>, you can still, on inauguration weekend, show that you are going to fight back against Trump,&quot; she added. </p>

<p>Organizers say the &quot;strike&quot; can take many forms, depending on the striker&apos;s personal circumstances: abstaining from housework like laundry or food preparation; refusing to tidy up a conference room after a work meeting, or refusing to do other administrative tasks around the office; refusing to flirt, return a smile on the street, wear makeup, or shave. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m no longer going to accept one sexist remark, insinuation, action or verbalized thoughts without calling the person on it,&quot; one participant wrote on the strike&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://www.womenstrike.org/">website</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;I am not going to be at work, I will not be answering any emails, I&apos;ll be striking from wearing makeup, from smiling,&quot; another wrote. </p>

<p>Instead of laboring, organizers wrote, women are encouraged to &quot;be out in the streets demonstrating, and talking [to] our families, friends, and coworkers about what [we] need to make our lives fairer, happier, less hectic and more secure.&quot; </p>

<p>Davis clarified that the strike will not be made official until at least 20,000 people have pledged to participate. For comparison, she cited the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://time.com/4008060/women-strike-equality-1970/">August 1970 Women&apos;s Strike for Equality</a>&#x2014;about 50,000 marchers took to Fifth Avenue, while others pledged not to cook or clean for a day. &quot;We don&apos;t want this to be a small fringe thing,&quot; she said. So far, the strike has about 1,500 pledges. Steps to sign the online pledge are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://www.womenstrike.org/#pledge">here</a>. </p>

<p>Organizers of the concurrent Women&apos;s March on Washington have said explicitly that they are not organizing an anti-Trump protest. Instead, they&apos;re presenting their march as a push for fundamental human rights. Davis said that while she agrees that Trump is a symptom of a larger problem, the significance of the November election is undeniable. </p>

<p>&quot;The reality is this&#x2014;hundreds of women showed up at our November meeting because there was an awakening about how far we have <em>not</em> come,&quot; she said. &quot;Look at the election campaign and see not only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">statements made by the President-elect</a>, but also the ways in which Hillary Clinton was criticized in ways that were very engendered.&quot; </p>

<p>Strike organizers say they welcome trans and non-binary participants. Men, meanwhile, are encouraged to take a different tack. &quot;They should take on additional work at home to support women&#x2019;s full participation in the demonstrations,&quot; organizers wrote.  </p>

<p><em>National Women&apos;s Liberation is holding a public meeting ahead of the strike, on January 19th. The meeting will take place at 7:30 p.m., at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107175328/http://thecommonsbrooklyn.org/">The Commons</a> on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.</em> </p>
