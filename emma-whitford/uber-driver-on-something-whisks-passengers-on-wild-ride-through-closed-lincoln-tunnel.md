<p>Two co-workers at a Manhattan-based PR firm say their Uber driver sped them through a closed entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel early Thursday morning en route to Hoboken, narrowly missing a construction vehicle parked in his path. Port Authority officials waiting for the Uber on the far side of the tunnel allegedly determined that the driver was &quot;on something.&quot;  </p>

<p>Cori, 24, and Jeff, 23, say they had been out drinking at bars near Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night, and decided to call for an UberX home around 12:45 a.m. The ride was uneventful until their driver, identified on their receipt as a man named Forhad, passed by the New Jersey-bound entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel and on into a closed lane, speeding past construction workers to the New Jersey side. </p>

<p>&quot;He was heading towards the Lincoln Tunnel, and he drove past the entrance,&quot; said Cori, who spoke on condition that her last name be withheld. &quot;I think he realized that and tried to back up, but he obviously couldn&apos;t back up all the way because there were cars going into the correct entrance to the tunnel.&quot; </p>

<p>According to Cori and Jeff, the driver proceeded to drive over the divider separating the right and center tunnel entrances, past a &quot;huge&quot; Do Not Enter sign and beneath the red X&apos;s at the peak of the tunnel entrance that indicate a closed lane. They estimate that he was driving between 50 and 55 miles per hour.  </p>

<p>&quot;We kept saying &apos;Hey this is the wrong way, this is the wrong way, this is the wrong way,&quot; Jeff recalled. &quot;And he was just like, &apos;It&apos;s okay, it&apos;s okay this is the right way.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Before entering the tunnel, Cori says that she heard police sirens behind her. &quot;I guess [that officer] made a call, because when we got out of the tunnel there was ten to fifteen cop cars shining their lights, waiting,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Officers &quot;screamed&quot; at the driver to turn off the engine, and exit the vehicle with his hands up. They proceeded to do multiple DUI tests, including walking in a straight line, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054754/http://www.sobrietytest.org/duihorizontalgazenystagmustestpentest.html">the pen test</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;They were like, &apos;Look at the pen! Look at the pen! And screaming at him,&quot; Cori recalled. &quot;They decided that he wasn&apos;t drunk but he was &apos;on something.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="12315_Uberx.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054754im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/12315_Uberx.jpeg" width="640" height="542"> <br> <i> The receipt for the Lincoln Tunnel trip. </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Port Authority spokesman Joe Pantangelo confirmed that officials stopped the driver in New Jersey, and issued him six traffic summonses: three in New Jersey for reckless driving, disobeying pavement markers, and disobeying a red signal, and three in New York for disobeying a traffic control devise, failure to comply with police, and disobeying a steady red light. </p>

<p>Cori and Jeff say the officers ended up driving them the remaining fifteen minutes to Hoboken, but not before questioning them about the driver&apos;s condition, and even offering them some advice for the future. </p>

<p>&quot;The cops kind of scolded us for using Uber,&quot; Cori said. &quot;They were like, &apos;you know you guys shouldn&apos;t be using Uber. They&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054754/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/02/tlc_uber_driver_accused_of_assaulti.php">molesting</a> a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054754/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/28/uber_driver_rape.php">women</a> lately and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054754/http://fortune.com/2015/04/01/uber-driver-tried-to-rob-womans-home-after-taking-her-to-airport/">robbing houses</a>.&apos; They were like, you shouldn&apos;t use Uber anymore. You should use taxis.&quot; </p>

<p>The driver, meanwhile, expressed concern about his rating. &quot;He turned to us and was like, &apos;Hey please don&apos;t write a bad review for me.&apos; And we were just like, you have to be kidding,&quot; Jeff said. </p>

<p>Still, Jeff and Cori say that they&apos;re probably going to keep using Uber&#x2014;if not in Manhattan, at least in Hoboken. &quot;I&apos;m a little terrified after the experience,&quot; Cori said. &quot;I&apos;ll use it in Hoboken though. I rarely use it in Manhattan. I usually get a taxi.&quot; </p>

<p>Jeff ultimately received a $33.38 charge for a trip that ended ignominiously at the New Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>

<p>Reached for comment, Uber confirmed that the passengers had not filed a complaint about the incident. They said they would look into the incident, but did not have an immediate comment. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> An Uber spokesperson issued the following statement: </p>

<blockquote>Obviously this is disappointing to us and is not the type of experience we would want anyone to have with Uber. We have provided the rider with a full refund, and we will reeducate the driver on our expectations... before he is able to access Uber again. </blockquote>
