<p>Back in March, MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/24/bdb_monorail_ftw.php">admitted</a> that unless the state budget was finalized with funding for the MTA&apos;s 2015-2019 capital plan, his authority was on track to run out of money for new capital projects by June 30th. The MTA would have been reduced to a maintenance agency, keeping up with safety-critical track repairs but unable to award new contracts for major, arguably critical, projects like new subway cars and buses, and phase two of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/tags/secondavenuesubway">Second Avenue Subway</a>. </p>

<p>This week, that fate has been narrowly avoided. On Tuesday the MTA announced that the Capital Plan Review Board&#x2014;a group with final veto power over state-approved MTA funding plans&#x2014;has voted in the $27 billion 2015-19 Capital Plan, after nearly two years of debate and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/mta_budget.php">buck-passing</a> between city and state officials. </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA is the lifeblood of the New York metropolitan area&#x2019;s transportation network and we must ensure it has the capacity to meet the travel demands of the next generation and fuel one of the largest economies on the globe,&#x201D; stated Governor Cuomo, whose investment in NYC&apos;s crumbling infrastructure has historically been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/07/cuomo_relying_on_the_rich_for_his_c.php">disappointing</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Today marks a major step forward for the MTA, and the people of New York,&#x201D; added Prendergast in a statement. &quot;With historic levels of funding through the capital plan, we have the resources and support we need to fulfill the Governor&apos;s mandate to renew, enhance and expand our transportation infrastructure.&quot; </p>

<p>The state and city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/at_last_cuomo_and_de_blasio_have_ag.php">agreed to fund the MTA&apos;s 2015-19 capital plan</a> in October&#x2014;an announcement that turned out to be a small gesture in the midst of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://www.amny.com/transit/mta-capital-budget-at-27-billion-approved-after-nearly-two-years-of-negotiations-1.11836553">longest</a> capital plan approval <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/29/mta_de_blasio_money.php">process</a> in state history. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="030816_Cuomo3.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/030816_Cuomo3.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i>Cuomo and Prendergast announcing new high-tech buses earlier this year (via Governor&apos;s Office).</i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s definitely a relief,&quot; said William Henderson, director of the watchdog group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://www.pcac.org/">Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA</a>, of the plan&apos;s approval. &quot;The MTA has pretty much run out of tricks to shuffle money around.&quot; </p>

<p>The plan earmarks funding for Cuomo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/subway_facelift_shutdown.php">controversial renovations</a> to 31 subway stations in NYC, which will likely result in lengthy station shutdowns. $2.5 billion has been set aside for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/east_side_access_photos.php">East Side Access project</a> connecting the LIRR to Grand Central, and $695 million for four new Metro-North stations in the Bronx. Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway has been promised a $1 billion injection (we laid out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/21/money_in_money_out.php">asterisks to this promise</a> last month). </p>

<p>But while the MTA now has permission to award new contracts, the entirety of the $27 billion capital plan&#x2014;including the full $7.3 billion from Governor Cuomo and $2.5 billion from Mayor de Blasio&#x2014;has not been set aside in neat stacks for the authority&apos;s taking. (The Governor&apos;s office said on Tuesday that the state budget includes 2/5 of the remaining $7.3 billion.) </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA has an approved spending plan for new projects,&quot; Henderson clarified. &quot;But they don&apos;t necessarily have the money that funds that. The fear is what they are going to have to do to get all the money. If that means borrowing [from the city and/or state] that requires them to make some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/19/mta_fare_hike_get_it.php">changes in their fairs or tolls</a> to support that borrowing, that&apos;s a bad thing for riders.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re glad the MTA capital plan is finally approved. It&apos;s taken well over a year,&quot; said Nick Sifuentes of the straphangers advocacy group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM8Ie63fXMAhXK6YMKHQ9TAI4QFggdMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ridersny.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqm8fk1or7WG1QHrTueoKnZl55lw&amp;sig2=u_hkj8apAln21VDNyIcGZg">Riders Alliance</a>&#x2014;a group that has long been skeptical of the governor&apos;s monetary commitments. &quot;The question is where that money is going to come from.&quot; </p>

<p>Both the Mayor&apos;s and Governor&apos;s offices have been adamant in recent months that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020051310/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/report_cuomos_budget_punts_on_mta_c.php">concerns</a> about funding sources for the capital plan are unfounded, describing their commitments as &quot;ironclad.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Through the Enacted Budget, the State&apos;s commitment of $8.3 billion in new funding for the MTA is now law,&quot; said state budget spokesman Morris Peters in a statement. </p>
