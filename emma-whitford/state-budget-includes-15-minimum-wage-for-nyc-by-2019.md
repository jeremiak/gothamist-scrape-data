<p>The minimum wage for New York City will reach $15 per hour by the end of December 2018, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-and-legislative-leaders-announce-agreement-2016-2017-state-budget">State budget agreement</a> reached in Albany on the cusp of Thursday&apos;s midnight deadline. Governor Andrew Cuomo praised the decision, one he&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/15/cuomo_minimum_wage_albany.php">rigorously campaigning for</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/https://www.ny.gov/programs/mario-cuomo-campaign-economic-justice">under his late father&apos;s name</a> since September. &quot;Remember, the minimum wage law was passed by FDR,&quot; Cuomo stated on Thursday. &quot;He was a great Governor of New York.&quot; </p>

<p>The budget also secures paid family leave for workers who have been at a job for at least six months, starting in 2018 and eventually reaching 12 weeks. Compensation will start at 50% of the employee&apos;s average weekly income, and will max out at about $850 per week by 2021. Mayor de Blasio recently mandated six weeks of 100% paid parental leave starting in 2016, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/22/nyc_paid_parental_leave.php">for city workers</a>.  </p>

<p>The minimum wage in New York City is currently $9 per hour. As recently as last February, Cuomo dismissed the possibility of a $13 minimum wage, calling the proposal a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150204/gramercy/cuomo-calls-minimum-wage-plan-non-starter-latest-salvo-against-mayor">non-starter</a>.&quot; Since then, gradual increases to a $15 minimum wage have been secured for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/fast_food_workers_raise.php">fast food workers</a> in New York, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/de_blasio_city_minimum_wage.php">City</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/11/cuomo_announces_state-wide_15_minim.php">State</a> employees. </p>

<p>But while most workers in NYC can expect $15 within three years, on par with Cuomo&apos;s campaign promise (NYC businesses with fewer than 10 employees get an extra year to catch up), the new budget makes a more conditional promise to workers who live elsewhere in the state. Westchester County is scheduled to reach a $15 minimum wage in six years, by the end of 2021, and Upstate workers can expect a minimum of $12.50 per hour by the end of 2020. From there, Cuomo said on Thursday, the minimum wage will be &quot;indexed&quot; to $15. </p>

<p>&quot;At what index? At an index to be determined as the appropriate calibration at the time by the Division of Budget,&quot; he said. This too is conditional, since the budget also gives the state authority to &quot;suspend the scheduled increases&quot; starting in 2019, if the &quot;economic conditions warrant it.&quot; </p>

<p>Cuomo described these conditions as a &quot;safety valve&quot; on Thursday, adding that, &quot;You want to increase it at the right rate and, if the economy turns, you want to be able to pause it.&quot; State labor and budget analysts, both part of the executive branch, will have the final word. The concessions made for a speech with conflicting messages, as Cuomo argued that an increased minimum wage will stimulate the economy, while conceding that &quot;people have a fear that it could have a negative impact.&quot; </p>

<p>Indeed, the hike was vehemently opposed by business groups who argued that employers will cut hours and lay off employees to afford paying wages. &#x201C;This increase is still too much for many businesses,&#x201D; the Business Council of New York said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/01/ny-set-to-approve-15-minimum-wage-plan/">in a statement</a>. &#x201C;The last thing employers need is higher state-imposed costs.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Many economists have challenged this argument, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/14/minimum_wage_nyc_stringer.php">2015 report by NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer</a> noted that the hike could help small businesses attract and retain workers. </p>

<p>Setting the schedule for fast food worker wage increases last summer, the Cuomo-appointed Fast Food Wage Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/fast_food_workers_raise.php">made the case</a> for faster increases in NYC, where the cost of living is considerably higher than upstate. However, <a href="www.nelp.org/content/uploads/Fact-Sheet-How-Much-New-York-Workers-Need-15.pdf">according to</a> the National Employment Law Project, by 2021 Upstate workers in cities like Syracuse and Buffalo will need at least $15 per hour to cover basic living expenses. </p>

<p>The finalized budget is also notable for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/empire_state_corruption.php">what it lacks</a>, specifically any hint of the modest ethics reforms Cuomo introduced in his State of the State address: limiting legislators&#x2019; outside income, adopting a publicly funded campaign finance system, and closing a loophole that allows LLCs to donate lots of money to candidates. Cuomo called the reforms &quot;important&quot; at the time, acknowledging that last year both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/skelos_guilty.php">Senate</a> and Assembly heads were found guilty of corruption. He&apos;s since failed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-state-budget-set-to-omit-tighter-rules-on-ethics-1459127730">walk the walk</a>. </p>

<p>As predicted, the budget also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/cuomo_cuny_funding.php">backs off of proposals</a> that would have shifted millions in City University of New York and Medicaid spending to the City. </p>

<p>The State also authorized $1.5 billion for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/05/mta_says_it_will_fast-track_phase_t.php">Phase II of the Second Avenue Subway</a>, albeit gradually, over the course of the next eight years. As for the &quot;record $8.3 billion of State support&quot; for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://beta.gothamist.com/2016/03/24/bdb_monorail_ftw.php">MTA&apos;s 2015-19 Capital Plan</a> reiterated in the budget draft, William Henderson, director of the watchdog group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/http://www.pcac.org/">Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA</a>, said on Friday that the commitment is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020235/https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gothamist%20punting">still being punted</a>. &quot;They came through with the authorization to spend the money,&quot; he said. &quot;We still don&apos;t know where the money is coming from.&quot; </p>
