<p>Mets closer Jeurys Familia was arrested in New Jersey on Monday on a domestic violence charge, according to multiple reports and a complaint filed in Fort Lee Municipal Court. The All Star pitcher was recently featured in a video for #NotAFan, an anti-domestic violence campaign featuring pro athletes.  </p>

<p>In the video, Familia stretches and pounds his mitt over sound clips of 911 calls and blaring sirens. At the end, he says, in Spanish, &quot;I am not a fan of domestic violence.&quot; </p>

<p>The Bergen Record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104062118/http://www.northjersey.com/news/mets-reliever-jeurys-familia-arrested-on-domestic-violence-charge-1.1686047">published</a> the complaint [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104062118/http://media.nj.com/mets_main/other/Familia%20complaint.pdf">PDF</a>], which states that the victim, who has not been identified, sustained a bruised cheek and scratch to the chest. The complaint states that cops &quot;found probable cause to believe that domestic violence had occurred.&quot; </p>

<p>The alleged incident reportedly took place in a Fort Lee apartment around 2:22 a.m. on Monday. Familia, 27, and his wife, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104062118/https://www.facebook.com/bianca.rivas2?pnref=lhc">Bianca Rivas</a>, gave birth to their first son, Jeurys Jr., last June <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104062118/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/sports/baseball/new-york-mets-jeurys-familia-all-star-game.html">according to the NY Times</a>. The NJ Advance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104062118/http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2016/11/mets_closer_jeurys_familia_arrested_on_domestic_vi.html">reports</a> that the family lives in Fort Lee. </p>

<p>The complaint lists the charge against Familia as simple assault, a minor-injury misdemeanor charge. Bail was set at $1,500 on the condition that Familia not contact the victim upon release. The Bergen Record reports that bail has been posted. </p>

<p>The complaint identifies one Jeurys F. Mojica, but the Record notes that the date of birth on the complaint matches Familia&apos;s date of birth on the Mets website. A Facebook page that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104062118/https://www.facebook.com/jeurys.familiamojica">appears to belong</a> to the pro athlete is under the name Jeurys Familia Mojica. </p>
