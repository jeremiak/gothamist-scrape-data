<p>A Florida teenager was arrested at Port Authority Bus Terminal on Wednesday afternoon after he allegedly alluded to killing police officers and opened his bag to reveal a gun. Port Authority Police eventually searched the teen&apos;s bag and recovered a loaded revolver.  </p>

<p>The Port Authority says that the suspect, 18-year-old Hunter Taylor, did not confront or threaten officers directly. </p>

<p>A witness told Port Authority Police that Taylor was &quot;making statements in reference to killing police officers&quot; on Wednesday afternoon, specifically &quot;let&apos;s off some cops,&quot; according to Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo. Taylor also allegedly opened his bag to show the witness his revolver. </p>

He told me he wanted to shoot a cop,&quot; Pugh told the tabloid. &quot;I didn&apos;t believe him. Then he showed me the gun.&quot; </p>

<p>Accord to Pentangelo, Taylor and Pugh&#x2014;who reportedly lives in a Brooklyn homeless shelter&#x2014;did not know each other prior to yesterday&apos;s interaction. </p>

<p>Port Authority police arrested Taylor around 4:00 p.m., and obtained a search warrant for his bag. Around 8:30 p.m. they recovered a loaded Smith and Wesson .38 caliber revolver and a small bag of alleged marijuana. </p>

<p>Hunter, who lives in Groveland, Florida, has been charged with criminal possession of a weapon, making a terroristic threat, and unlawful possession of marijuana.</p>
