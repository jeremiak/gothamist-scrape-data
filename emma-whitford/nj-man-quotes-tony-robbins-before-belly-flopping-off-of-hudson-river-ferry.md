<p>A NJ man attempted to act out a motivational boardroom cliche on Sunday by paraphrasing a Tony Robbins quote on the top deck of a Hudson River commuter ferry and belly-flopping into the water, forcing the ferry to circle back and rescue him. </p>

<p>&quot;You wanna live your dreams? You wanna take the island? You gotta be willing to burn the boats,&quot; said 34-year old Alexander Vivanco in a video his buddy took. &quot;But my recommendation is this&#x2014;before you burn the boats, I suggest that you jump off them.&quot; </p>

<p>Careful not to leave any cliche, well, unturned, he followed up with a, &quot;Remember, you only live once!&quot; before flopping into the Hudson. </p>

<p>&quot;The goal was to do something outrageous and entertaining while at the same time trying to motivate people,&quot; Vivanco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605061059/http://nypost.com/2016/02/04/mohawked-loon-gives-self-help-speech-before-jumping-off-ferry/">told the NY Post</a> afterwards. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not telling everyone to go jump off boats, but just telling people to go after their dreams.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Vivanco flopped around 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, in front of an audience of about ten people, from a top-deck bench on a NY Waterway Manhattan-Weehawken ferry. NY Waterway was so upset, apparently, that a spokesperson for the company called Vivanco an &quot;asshole.&quot; The company is also planning to prosecute him, on top of disorderly conduct charges already leveraged by NJ police. </p>

<p>Maybe this all comes down to &quot;living in an extraordinary state&quot; and &quot;conditioning your nervous system,&quot; like Tony would. </p>
