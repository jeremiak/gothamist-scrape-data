<p>A 33-year-old NYPD officer was arrested in Sunset Park on Wednesday and charged with sexually assaulting a child. He was off-duty at the time of the arrest. </p>

<p>Court documents show that Officer Jacob Sabbagh was arraigned late Wednesday, and charged with sexual conduct against a child in the second degree, a D felony, as well as sexual abuse in the second degree, and endangering the welfare of a child. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091351/https://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/2-PenalLaw/130/130.80(1)(a).pdf">According to the top charge</a>, Sabbagh allegedly engaged in at least two sexual acts with a child 11 years old or younger over the course of at least three months. The indictment sites alleged encounters between June 1st, 2005 and March 30th, 2008. </p>

<p>Anonymous sources within the department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091351/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/nyregion/police-officer-accused-of-sexually-abusing-a-family-friends-daughter.html?ribbon-ad-idx=6&amp;rref=nyregion&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&amp;pgtype=article">told the NY Times</a> that the victim was the daughter of one of Sabbagh&apos;s family friends. She is believed to have slept at his home approximately twice a month between 2005, when she was 10, and 2008, when she turned 13. </p>

<p>Sabbagh joined the NYPD in 2009, but had been on modified assignment for the past year, working on building maintenance. His arrest concluded an investigation by the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau. </p>

<p>The victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091351/http://abc7ny.com/news/nypd-officer-charged-in-alleged-relationship-with-10-year-old-starting-in-2005/1126645/">reportedly filed a complaint</a> with the NYPD in 2010, when she was 16. </p>

<p>Court documents show that Sabbagh pled not guilty to all charges on Wednesday, and was released on his own recognizance. He has been stripped of his gun and badge, and suspended without pay. His next appearance is scheduled for February 24th. </p>

<p>Sabbagh is at least the third NYPD officer to be accused of sexual molestation in 2015. Bronx Officer  Vladimir Sosa, 38, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091351/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/cop_rape_bronx_teen.php">charged in March</a> for sexual encounters with a 16-year-old girl who attended his church. And in August, Brooklyn South Officer Joel Doseau, 43, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091351/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/06/cop_rape_williamsburg.php">charged with 40 counts of abuse</a> against a teenager. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091351/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/21/brooklyn_cop_accused_of_raping_girl.php">committed suicide</a> shortly thereafter. </p>
