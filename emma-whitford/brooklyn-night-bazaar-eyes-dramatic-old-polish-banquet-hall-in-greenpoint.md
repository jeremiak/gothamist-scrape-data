<p>When the Brooklyn Night Bazaar was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/11/brooklyn_night_bazaar_bmw.php">ousted</a> from its 23,000 square-foot warehouse on Banker Street last June with a firm kick from the world&apos;s largest luxury auto maker, co-owner Belvy Klein told us that he was on the lookout for a new venue for his massive, nocturnal food-court-flea-venue. By then, he had already secured a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/11/brooklyn_night_bazaar_riis.php">multi-year lease</a> with Jacob Riis Park, for a summer weekend project dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://riisparkbeachbazaar.com/">Riis Park Beach Bazaar</a>. Now, ten months later, Klein and his crew are seeking a liquor license for the Polonaise Terrace building, a towering, Polish banquet hall in Greenpoint. </p>

<p>The liquor license application, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160302/greenpoint/owners-of-brooklyn-night-bazaar-want-reopen-on-greenpoint-avenue">first reported</a> by DNAInfo, describes a possible 660-person venue with stages, ping pong tables, mini golf, a video arcade and a karaoke bar, plus a vending area. The requested hours of operation are 6:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. on weekdays, and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on the weekends.</p>

<p>Reached for comment today, Klein and Bazaar co-owner Aaron Broudo confirmed that the venue is one that he and his partners are &quot;looking into, among others.&quot; </p>

<p>Until it closed in 2013, Polonaise Terrace at 144 Greenpoint Avenue served as a venue for large-scale Polish weddings and banquets. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://www.longislandcateringhalls.com/li/polonaise-terrace.html">online listing from 2010</a> describes four halls&#x2014;the Empress, the Symphony, the Embassy and the Starlight Room&#x2014;plus a bridal suite, personal Maitre&apos;D, doorman and valets. <br>
 <br>
New York Shitty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/tag/polonaise-terrace">published</a> a translation from an article in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://www.dziennik.com/">Nowy Dziennik</a>, a daily Polish-language paper, when the venue&apos;s closure was imminent. &quot;We will 100% be closing the restaurant at the end of September [2013], however information regarding the sale is gossip,&quot; an anonymous manager told the news outlet. </p>

<p>City documents show that the building was purchased last June by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://www.cayugacapital.com/portfolio/">Cayuga Capital Management</a>, a Brooklyn real estate development and property manager. </p>

<p>We&apos;ll update with any additional information. In the meantime, join us in imaging some sweaty moshing and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/02/photos_brooklyn_night_bazaar_begins.php#photo-1">rice ball eating</a> against a backdrop of gilded gold chandeliers.   </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> An earlier version of this story described the Polonaise Terrace building as landmarked. It is in fact in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030202/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/GREENPOINT_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf">landmark district</a>. </p>
