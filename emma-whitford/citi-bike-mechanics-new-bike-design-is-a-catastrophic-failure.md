<p>A few days after Citi Bike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160331/new-york-city/1000-citi-bikes-yanked-from-docks-due-faulty-part">pulled 1,000 of its newer-model bikes</a> out of rotation because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://cyclingtips.com/2012/05/whats-in-a-fork/">forks</a> were &quot;wearing faster than expected,&quot; the company&apos;s unionized mechanics sent a letter to management, claiming that the new Citi Bike model was weak and faulty in its entirety, and &quot;put into question the integrity and safety of the new bikes.&quot; </p>

<p>While Citi Bike has attributed the need for repairs to the bikes&apos; heavy use on NYC streets, the mechanics have countered that the fault is in the design. Their e-mail to management, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sleek-new-citi-bikes-not-built-company-mechanics-article-1.2645240">first reported by the Daily News</a>, was acquired by Gothamist on Monday. </p>

<p>Citi Bike&apos;s 200 full-time and seasonal mechanics, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/09/citi_bike_workers_union.php">have been unionized since summer 2015</a> and are represented by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://www.twulocal100.org/">Transportation Workers Union Local 100</a>, say that they first raised their concerns about the new bike to management last September. </p>

<p>&quot;We tried to warn management many months ago about these safety issues with the new bikes but were completely ignored,&quot; wrote one mechanic and TWU representative in an e-mail to his coworkers last month (he asked that his name be withheld for fear of employer retaliation). &quot;We do not want to be blamed for the catastrophic failure that is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://www.motivateco.com/news/categories/citibike">Motivate</a> bike.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/07/citi_bikes_get_new_design.php">Citi Bike 2.0</a>, which debuted last June, is designed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/https://benserotta.com/">Ben Serotta</a>, an Olympic racing bike designer. Until recently, all of his bikes were manufactured and assembled overseas, in China. The company recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://www.fastcoexist.com/3059319/the-countrys-largest-bike-share-operator-is-now-making-its-bikes-in-detroit">opened an assembly operation in Detroit</a>, and a Motivate spokeswoman said bikes assembled domestically have been rotated into NYC&apos;s fleet in the last few weeks.  </p>

<p>The union alleges that the first version of Citi Bike, manufactured in Toronto, Canada <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://www.devinci.com/home.html">by the company DeVinci</a>, was much sturdier, and withstood three years of use with comparatively few issues. The mechanics would prefer manufacturing facilities much closer to NYC, which they say would enhance quality control. </p>

<p>&quot;They [Motivate] hired Ben, whose experience is Tour de France-type bicycles, not NYC,&quot; said TWU Local 100 organizer Nick Bedell. &quot;The China developer is very hard to communicate with. Motivate launched 1,000 of these bikes at once, and within a month problems started showing up.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to fork issues, the mechanics allege that the bikes&apos; seat tubes, which riders can adjust, are consistently &quot;dimpling and cracking,&quot; and that the kickstand mounts are &quot;cracking and giving way, leaving gaping holes at the bottom of the frame.&quot; </p>

<p>A section of the bike called the rear dropout, which cradles the back wheel inside the bike frame, allegedly becomes &quot;skewed and uneven to the extent that they place undue stress on the rear axle and hub resulting in catastrophic axle breaks and premature hub/wheel failure.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s worth noting that Citi Bike&apos;s functionality was far from seamless <em>before</em> the new bikes were introduced. The company&apos;s early software <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/30/citi_bike_turning_around.php">was glitchy</a>, and Motivate was faced with a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102504/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/citi_bike_instated_a_graveyard_shif.php"> backlog of 900 busted bikes</a>&#x2014;the original design&#x2014;last June. </p>

<p>&quot;The new line of Citi Bikes are very popular with riders with a sleeker, more comfortable design,&quot; said a Citi Bike spokeswoman in a statement Monday. &quot;Like with any innovation we&apos;ve learned lessons and are making improvements to durability, but all Citi Bikes on the road are extremely safe&#x2014;with nearly 28 million rides and no fatalities.&quot;</p>
