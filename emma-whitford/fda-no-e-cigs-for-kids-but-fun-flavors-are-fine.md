<p>In a move it&apos;s calling &quot;historic,&quot; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced the expansion of its regulatory authority to cover cigars, hookah and pipe tobacco, and most significantly for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/22/e-cigs_e-cigarettes_njoy_vaping_vap.php">time travelers from the year 2013</a>&#x2014;the e-cigarette. </p>

<p>While such regulations are already established in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/us-e-cigarette-regulations-50-state-review">some states</a> (including New York), now all Americans under the age of 18 will be barred from purchasing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/e-cig_explodes_like_a_firecracker_i.php">sometimes-explosive</a> but always ridiculous-looking e-cigs. Customers will have to display ID, as they would for a pack of analog cancer cylinders. </p>

<p>&quot;As cigarette smoking among those under 18 has fallen, the use of other nicotine products, including e-cigarettes, has taken a drastic leap,&quot; said Federal Health &amp; Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell in a statement Thursday. &quot;All of this is creating a new generation of Americans who are at risk of addiction. Today&apos;s announcement is an important step in the fight for a tobacco-free generation.&quot; </p>

<p>Yet the FDA&apos;s new rules do <em>not</em> prohibit or regulate the sale of flavored liquid nicotine, which has been credited as a key tool for pushing e-cigs on youths with flavor names like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://www.vapor4life.com/e-juice/dessert/">banana dessert, rainbow candy, and vanilla custard</a>. The FDA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm208085.htm">banned flavored combustable cigarettes in 2009</a>.</p>

<p>While the new rules leave open the possibility of banning flavors a few years down the road, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/science/fda-rules-electronic-cigarettes.html?action=Click&amp;contentCollection=BreakingNews&amp;contentID=63106555&amp;pgtype=article">the NY Times points out</a> that the language in the new regulatory text is not explicit about a future ban. </p>

<p>&quot;The concern is for at least three years, flavored e-cigarette products will remain on the market no matter how many kids are using them,&#x201D; Matthew Myers, president of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/">Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids</a>, told the paper.</p>

<p>A recent Center for Disease Control study found that 13.4% of kids surveyed had vaped in the past month, versus less than 10 percent who had smoked a cigarette. In 2013-14, 80% of kid smokers surveyed by the FDA and National Institutes of Health said that they&apos;d used flavored tobacco products in the last month.  </p>

<p>Science <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/harvard-study-confirms-dangers-of-vaping-b99631238z1-361343541.html">suggests</a> that e-cigs&#x2014;which some advocates consider a safer alternative to combustible cigs for smokers trying to quit&#x2014;contain chemicals that are harmful to human lungs. As for younger users, doctors say the nicotine in e-cigs is highly addictive and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://www.voanews.com/content/report-e-cigarettes-can-cause-permanent-brain-damage-for-teens/2744206.html">can lead to permanent brain damage</a>. </p>

<p>Today&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-10685.pdf">regulations</a> will also require e-cig and cigar producers to register with the FDA for the first time. </p>

<p>Previously flexing without government oversight&#x2014;and, in the case of e-cigs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://www.vox.com/2016/5/5/11595784/fda-rule-e-cigarettes-tobacco">reaping billions</a>&#x2014;these companies will now have to break down their ingredients and production processes in detail, and list warnings and ingredients on their packaging. </p>

<p>E-cigarette and cigar vending machines have been outlawed as well, and companies will no longer be allowed to give out free samples. The regulations, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214059/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/24/fdas_new_e-cig_rules_positive_for_i.php">were first drafted in 2014</a>, will go into effect in 90 days. </p>

<p>Naturally, the business community would have preferred that e-cigarettes remain relatively unregulated. </p>

<p>&quot;These final deeming regs could realistically stifle innovation, which could dramatically slow industry growth by dis-incentivizing consumer conversion from combustible cigs,&quot; Bonnie Herzog, a tobacco analyst for Wells Fargo Securities, said on Thursday in her newsletter.</p>

<p>&quot;This would ultimately have a net negative impact on public health, which is clearly in direct opposition to the FDA&apos;s goal.&quot; </p>
