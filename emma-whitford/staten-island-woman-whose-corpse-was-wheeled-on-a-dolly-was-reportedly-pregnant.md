<p>The father of late 26-year-old Obiamaka Aduba&#x2014;who was allegedly murdered by her husband on Staten Island last week, her body <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006121721/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/21/cops_still_searching_for_man_who_wh.php">rolled around the neighborhood on a metal dolly</a>&#x2014;told reporters that his daughter was about four months pregnant at the time of her death. </p>

<p>Adubah&apos;s father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006121721/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/05/23/father-of-slain-staten-island-woman-whose-corpse-was-wheeled-through-the-streets-says-she-was-pregnant.html">spoke off camera with NY1</a> on Monday, confirming that his daughter was married to the suspect, 31-year-old Anthony Lopez, for about three years, and that she was afraid of him. He added that he had encouraged her to leave Lopez, reminding her that she could always move back home. </p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006121721/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/22/police_arrest_man_accused_of_killin.php">arrested Lopez</a> over the weekend, concluding a manhunt for the suspect who abandoned his wife&apos;s body and fled on Friday. He was apprehended in Harlem with a shaved head&#x2014;apparently an attempt at disguise after police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006121721/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/20/staten_island_manhunt.php">released a photograph of him with longer hair</a>.</p>

<p>Lopez has since been charged with murder and concealment of a human corpse. He was reportedly pushing the body towards the Kill van Kull in the Mariners Harbor section of Staten Island, suggesting to investigators that he may have been attempting to dump the body in the water. </p>

<p>The Medical Examiner&apos;s office is determining Aduba&apos;s cause of death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006121721/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/career-criminal-pushing-dead-wife-metal-dolly-arrested-article-1.2645136">According to the Daily News</a>, Lopez and Abuda&apos;s relationship was mired with domestic violence&#x2014;he allegedly beat his wife regularly, enough to break her bones, and often confiscated her cell phone. </p>

<p>The Staten Island DA&apos;s office confirmed to NY1 that there have been eight domestic violence homicides in the borough this year to date. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006121721/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/04/domestic_violence_behind_the_c.html">The Advance reports</a> that five of the victims were stabbed to death, and four of them were children. </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s clearly a problem with intimate-partner violence happening repeatedly,&quot; Diane Arneth, CEO of Community Health Action of Staten Island, told the news outlet last month. &quot;It&apos;s not necessarily tied to socio-economic status. It crosses all lines.&quot;</p>
