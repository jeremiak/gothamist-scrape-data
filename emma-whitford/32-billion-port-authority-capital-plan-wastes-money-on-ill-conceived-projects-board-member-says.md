<p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey&#x2014;an entity founded in 1921 to serve the public transit needs of both states&#x2014;announced a $32 billion ten-year capital plan draft on Thursday that New Jersey lawmakers said shortchanged critical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/port_authority_bus_terminal.php">bus terminal renovations</a> in favor of governors&apos; pet infrastructure projects, including Governor Andrew Cuomo&apos;s New York-centric <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/laguardia_reboot_ferry.php">LaGuardia</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/cuomo_jfk_airport_overhaul.php">John F. Kennedy Airport</a> renovations. </p>

<p>The plan includes $3.5 billion for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/04/video_john_oliver_declares_port_aut.php">aging</a> bus terminal&#x2014;a project that&apos;s been estimated to cost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/port_authority_bus_terminal.php">about $10 billion</a>, with some funding expected from local air rights, and the federal government. </p>

<p>It also includes about $1.5 billion for Governor Cuomo&apos;s circuitous and eyebrow-raising <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/21/cuomos_laguardia_airtrain_will_be_g.php">LaGuardia-Willets Point AirTrain proposal</a>; an already-promised $600 million toward $4.2 billion renovations at LaGuardia Terminals C and D (the rest of the money is expected to come from Delta and other private partners); and $1.7 billion for a Governor Chris Christie-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130911/REAL_ESTATE/130919963/sources-christie-to-back-1b-path-extension-in-newark">endorsed</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=1913">PATH train extension</a> from Downtown Manhattan to Newark Airport. The draft plan also includes about $1 billion to renovate JFK airport&#x2014;a project Cuomo announced a day before the Port Authority meeting.</p>

<p>&quot;When the decisions are more concerned with satisfying the parochial interests of our governors than the region&apos;s needs, then this agency loses its direction, and in my opinion, its purpose,&quot; said New Jersey Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski. Chair of the Assembly&apos;s Transportation Committee, he supports larger investments in the bus terminal, which he and other New Jersey politicians argued fits more squarely into the Port Authority mission of serving both New York and New Jersey commuters. </p>

<p>An additional $2.7 billion will go towards debt service on the construction of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/12/hudson_river_tunnel_update.php">new Gateway rail tunnel under the Hudson River</a>, as the existing tunnel was severely damaged during Hurricane Sandy and has subjected hundreds of thousands of daily commuters to frequent delays. Despite state and federal commitments, the $24 billion project is far from fully funded. &quot;Obviously there&#x2019;s still a significant local commitment that has to be matched,&quot; Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/01/port-authority-moves-forward-with-capital-plan-delivering-27b-gateway-commitment-108502">told reporters</a>. </p>

<p>Referring to the entire capital plan as a &quot;grand compromise,&quot; Port Authority board member Ken Lipper, a Cuomo appointee, described the PATH extension and LaGuardia AirTrain in particular as &quot;amongst the most ill-conceived projects that I&apos;ve experienced in government.&quot; Citing what he deemed to be a lack of ridership interest in both projects, he proposed a resolution to have both struck from the plan. </p>

<p>&quot;These two projects in the &apos;grand compromise&apos; require that we raise tolls, fairs and fees on commuters in the other facilities,&quot; Lipper predicted, adding, &quot;These projects are not for free, and I posit that it&apos;s not reasonable to make commuters pay for railroads to the airports that there&apos;s no demand for.&quot; </p>

<p>Calling for larger Port Authority commitments on Thursday, New Jersey Senator Bob Gordon also cautioned that federal funding shouldn&apos;t be assumed under the incoming administration. &quot;What happens to the capital plan if the anticipated $1.6 billion in federal funds does not materialize?&quot; he wondered. &quot;What projects get canceled and how are those decisions made?&quot; </p>

<p>Jameson Doig, a Princeton professor and Port Authority historian, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502144834/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/nyregion/ny-nj-port-authority-new-bus-terminal.html">told the NY Times last month</a> that he believed Cuomo was flexing his authority in the lead-up to the release of the draft capital plan. (Governors Cuomo and Christie have veto-power over any Port Authority budgetary decision.) </p>

<p>&quot;We know that Governor Cuomo has been very interested in having substantial funds to carry out projects that he thinks are important,&quot; Doig said. &quot;From his point of view, the bus terminal is not one of them.&quot; </p>

<p>Last month, Port Authority Chairman John Degnan, a Christie appointee and vocal proponent of bus terminal funding, told the paper that he would not bow to gubernatorial pressures. &quot;The Port Authority needs to work with the governors, but it should not be submissive to either one of them,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>But Degnan struck a more conciliatory note on Thursday. &quot;As a member of the board, I need to work toward a capital plan that will be approved by the governors and help us move forward with critical projects like Gateway tunnels and the bus terminal and the rehab of LaGuardia and Newark,&quot; he said. &quot;And I don&apos;t believe compromise is a bad thing. Am I widely enthusiastic about every single component? No. Do I think it has enough money to erect a new bus terminal in a ten year period? No.&quot; </p>

<p>Governor Cuomo praised the draft plan on Thursday. &quot;This successful resolution was a direct result of all parties working together to fund important projects on both sides of the Hudson,&quot; he said in a statement. </p>

<p>The authority will vote on a final draft in February, following public hearings in both states in the coming weeks. </p>
