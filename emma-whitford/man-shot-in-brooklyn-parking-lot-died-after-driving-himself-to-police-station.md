<p>A 28-year-old man was shot in the chest in an AutoZone parking lot in East Flatbush on Thursday night, and drove himself to the 63rd Precinct stationhouse before succumbing to his injuries. </p>

<p>Police say that the victim, whose name has not been released, was shot at 7:52 p.m. on Thursday, after getting into an argument with the suspected shooter. The shooter fled, and the victim drove four blocks to the 63rd Precinct on Brooklyn Avenue where he told police, &quot;I&apos;ve been shot.&quot; EMS responded to the station and transported the victim to Kings County Hospital, where he died an hour later. </p>

<p>The victim was a dollar van driver, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163531/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-shot-to-death-in-autozone-parking-lot/1457998/">according to ABC</a>. The outlet also reported that four men fled the scene&#x2014;three in a Mazda Sedan and one on foot&#x2014;but the NYPD could not confirm this. </p>
