<p>A group of seven animal rights activists disrupted a moment of silence during Easter Mass at St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral in Midtown on Sunday, shouting, &#x201C;Easter is a time for love. No more shedding animal blood!&#x201D; as they were pulled from the hall by security guards. One member of the group, 23-year-old Jacob Martin, walked down the central isle with a bullhorn shouting that &quot;only the devil&quot; could create &#x201C;animals capable of love and joy just so humans can make them suffer and die.&#x201D; Martin wore a GoPro strapped to his chest, which some worshipers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082502/http://nypost.com/2016/03/27/protesters-disrupt-easter-mass-at-st-pats-frighten-worshipers/">suspected was a bomb</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;I think we&apos;ll put a tape where the camera blinks next time to make sure people aren&apos;t confused,&quot; said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082502/http://www.collectivelyfree.org/">Collectively Free</a> spokeswoman Raffaella Ciavatta. &quot;New York is such a police city that I can see how people would react that way.&quot; </p>

Saint Patrick&apos;s Cathedral - New York St. Patrick&apos;s CathedralWhy disrupt a church? Why on Easter?The church is a place for communities to come together and it&apos;s during this moment that people need to be reminded of their true values such as thou shalt not kill. And on Easter we gather with our family and friends to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus while holding on to the violent tradition of feasting on the bodies of animals. Don&apos;t you think that&apos;s rude, ineffective. Aren&apos;t you antagonizing people?We find important to provoke a discussion about this, by any means necessary. If you look at history you will find other examples of movements who have challenged both the church and the public. Such as the LGBTQ movement, feminists, and racial equality. Don&apos;t you think you could have tried to talk to them first?You don&apos;t ask nicely when violence is being encouraged. What do you expect to achieve?We are looking to provoke a discussion about the animals whose voices are not being heard. Animals who are no different from the cats and dogs we call family.  #AnimalRights #HolyWeek #Easter #EasterSunday #HeIsRisen</p>Posted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082502/https://www.facebook.com/collectivelyfree/">Collectively Free</a> on Sunday, March 27, 2016</blockquote></div></div></center>

<p>Ciavatta said that while Martin was the only Christian among the protesters, her group sees significance in Easter Sunday from an animal-rights perspective. &quot;Church is a place where community comes together, and people need to be reminded of their values like &apos;Thou shalt not kill,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;We [shouldn&apos;t] gather to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus while holding on to the violent tradition of feasting on the bodies of animals.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ham and lamb are big traditions at Easter,&quot; she added. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="032816_Easter.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082502im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/032816_Easter.jpeg" width="320" height="328"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> (via Collectively Free)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Martin was arrested and charged with interrupting a religious service about fifteen minutes into the noon mass, according to the NYPD. Ciavatta said on Monday that she and the other protesters were also handcuffed, until a person she believed to be associated with St. Patrick&apos;s asked that only Martin be arrested. &quot;They were definitely very violent with us,&quot; Ciavatta said of the St. Patrick&apos;s security officers. &quot;One of our activists lost her shoe when they were dragging her off.&quot; </p>

<p>A spokeswomen for St. Patrick&apos;s declined to comment on the service. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082502/http://nypost.com/2016/03/27/protesters-disrupt-easter-mass-at-st-pats-frighten-worshipers/">According to the Post</a>, Reverend Damian O&apos;Connell said a prayer for the protesters, reminding congregants that &#x201C;Pope Francis calls us to interact peacefully with those who oppose us.&quot;</p>

<p>Ciavatta added that while she was not expecting a positive response from the congregants, she is surprised by the number of &quot;hateful messages&quot; that have already been sent to the organization via Facebook. In one direct message shared with Gothamist, a commenter writes, &quot;You guys are all fucken [<em>sic</em>] idiots and i hope you all die and feel the flames of Hell.&quot; </p>
