										<p>The NYPD responded to a suspicious package call, one of hundreds they&apos;ve received citywide in recent days, around 8:30 this morning in Times Square. The FDNY stood on call to make any necessary emergency transports. Investigators shut down 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues, and witness updates chronicling the incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026030130/https://twitter.com/search?q=suspicious%20package%20times%20square&amp;src=typd">flew on Twitter</a>. Shortly before 10:00 a.m., the package was determined to be benign&#x2014;an empty suitcase. </p>

<p>Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have been adamant in recent days that New Yorkers should both go about their regular business, and remain vigilant. </p>

<p>&quot;They [terrorists] want to make you afraid,&quot; Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026030130/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/18/cuomo_calls_chelsea_explosion_an_ac.php">said</a> at a press conference on Sunday. &quot;They want to make you worry about going into New York City or New York State. They want to make you worry about going across a bridge or a subway. We&apos;re not going to let them instill fear, because then they would win.&quot;</p>

<p>There are nearly 1,000 extra NY State Police and National Guard soldiers deployed in the city this week, as well as extra cops on the streets and in subways. Suspicious package investigations have been observed even in typically uncrowded parts of the city. On Monday evening, NYPD officers were seen steering pedestrians away from a normally quiet block of Berry Street on Williamsburg&apos;s Southside while they investigated a black garbage bag on the sidewalk. After blocking off the street, cops determined that it was simply a garbage bag.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the FDNY said on Monday that their line has been getting &quot;tons&quot; of suspicious package calls since Saturday night. </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s been more calls than normal,&quot; he said. &quot;If they turned out to be anything, you would know.&quot; </p>
