<p>More than half of East New York&apos;s current residents won&apos;t be able to afford the &quot;affordable&quot; apartments proposed as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/05/a_first_look_at_de_blasios_affordab.php">Mayor de Blasio&apos;s $41 billion housing plan</a>, according to a report issued Thursday by Comptroller Scott Stringer&apos;s office. </p>

<p>The report echoes what many East New York residents and housing advocates have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/east_new_york_gentrification_afford.php">long</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/east_new_york_gentrification.php">argued</a>: proposed rezoning of the neighborhood would not generate enough housing at truly affordable rents for the neighborhood&apos;s long-term residents.</p>

<p>&quot;Instead of strengthening the affordability of this community, the proposed rezoning would serve as an engine for displacement,&quot; said the comptroller in a statement. </p>

<p>East New York is the first of fifteen low-income neighborhoods scheduled to be rezoned as part of de Blasio&apos;s plan. In February, the mayor released an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/02/city-planning-unveils-full-east-new-york-rezoning-details-7250-new-homes-expected-by-2030.html">initial blueprint</a> for rezoning in East New York&apos;s Cypress Hills neighborhood and adjacent Ocean Hill in Bed-Stuy, which calls for the construction of 7,000 new apartments by 2030, plus an additional one million new square feet of commercial space. </p>

<p>Of these 7,000 apartments, 3,447 would be designated as affordable. </p>

<p>Eighty percent of these units would be reserved for families making no more than $46,000, or 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI), and 27% for families making $31,000 or less, or 40% of the AMI. (The city defines a &quot;family&quot; as a household of three, with any number of earners.) Only half of those affordable units will be reserved specifically for current residents. </p>

<p>According to Stringer&apos;s report, the median income in East New York is just $32,815 per year. </p>

<p>The city defines an &quot;affordable&quot; apartment as one that rents for 30% of the household&apos;s annual income. By Stringer&apos;s count, these &quot;affordable&quot; units would be a stretch for 55% of local residents. </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s nothing affordable about a housing plan that is beyond the reach of half the community,&quot; wrote Stringer in a letter to City Planning Commission Chair Carl Weisbrod.</p>

<p>New affordable units would be constructed according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/housing/mandatory-inclusionary-housing-summary.shtml">Mandatory Inclusionary Zoning</a>, a proposed city-wide zoning change that would require 25-30% of apartments in new developments to be permanently affordable. </p>

<p>Community Boards across the city have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/manhattan_affordable_housing.php">recently voted against MIZ</a>, arguing that the benefit of a small number of affordable units will be outweighed by the influx of more affluent renters; Councilmember Inez Barron, whose district includes a small portion of East New York&apos;s rezoning area, has described it as &quot;totally unrealistic&quot; and a &quot;model for gentrification.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Stringer&apos;s report, almost 50,000 of East New York&apos;s current residents live in unregulated housing (apartments that are neither NYCHA-run nor rent stabilized) and would therefore be at risk of displacement with the predicted influx of higher-income residents. </p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s office has dismissed Stringer&apos;s analysis, arguing that the &quot;first wave&quot; of affordable housing in the neighborhood would generate 1,200 &quot;100% affordable&quot; apartments over the next two years. </p>

<p>Mayoral spokesman Wiley Norvell also pointed out that any developer receiving an additional HPD subsidy&#x2014;in his estimation, that means most developers coming to East New York in the first two years of the plan&#x2014;will be held to stricter affordability standards: at least 40% of the units would have to be set aside for renters who earn between $23,350 and $38,850 per year. </p>

<p>Norvell has also stressed that the displacement Stringer predicts in East New York is not a &quot;symptom of the rezoning,&quot; but, citing Bushwick and Crown Heights as case studies, rather a &quot;byproduct of a very hot housing market&quot; across the borough.</p>

<p>&quot;The comptroller has it completely backwards,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;These are families that are in danger today, because the market is already putting pressure on their rents. It&#x2019;ll take enormous preservation and new affordable housing efforts to turn that tide, which is precisely what the City is working for.&quot; </p>

<p>Maritza Silva-Farrell, a coordinator for the tenant advocacy group Real Affordability for All [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/https://www.facebook.com/RealAffordability/info/">RAFA</a>], remains unpersuaded by City Hall&apos;s assurances. &quot;If you think of the number of low-wage workers in our city, who are hoping to make $15 an hour, that gets you $25,000 a year,&quot; she told us this fall. &quot;That is not what this housing plan is going to be covering.&quot;</p>

<p>RAFA released an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404072539/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/21/affordable_housing_east_ny.php">alternative rezoning plan</a> in September, which calls for each of the 15 rezoned low-income neighborhoods to include a &quot;special purpose district.&quot; In that district, developers hoping to earn city subsidies would be required to build 50% affordable units&#x2014;not by citywide AMI standards, but by the standards of that particular neighborhood. </p>
