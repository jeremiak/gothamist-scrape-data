<p>A three-alarm fire ripped through a Times Square restaurant on Seventh Avenue early Tuesday morning, sending up billows of black smoke and eventually spreading to adjacent buildings. According to the FDNY, firefighters responded to the scene around 4:45 a.m. and fought the blaze for three hours. No serious injuries were reported, though one person was hospitalized and two firefighters were treated on the scene. </p>

<p>&quot;We believe the fire started in the duct work in one of the restaurants,&quot; FDNY Assistant Chief Joseph Pfeifer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223203820/http://abc7ny.com/news/fire-burning-at-midtown-diner-on-7th-ave/1764920/">told ABC7</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;When this fire came in there was a lot of smoke,&quot; he added. &quot;Actually a block away the entire street was full of smoke and we knew we had substantial fire.&quot; </p>

<p>A spokesman for the FDNY told Gothamist that the blaze started inside the duct work of 723 Seventh Avenue, which houses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223203820/https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsq-brasserie-new-york">TSQ Brasserie</a>, a combination sushi restaurant and steak house on the corner of 48th Street. TSQ is on the ground floor of an eleven-story high rise, and the spokesman said fire spread to the upper floors. </p>
