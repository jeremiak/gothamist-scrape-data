<p>An extension of larger protests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402221524/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/25/de_blasio_protesters.php">last winter</a>, People&apos;s Monday highlights specific victims of police brutality year-round.  </p>

<p>This week, protesters met at Grand Central around 7:00 p.m. to stage a call-and-response reading of several facts pertaining to the October 2014 death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, a Chicago teenager who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402221524/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/laquan-mcdonald-chicago-police-shooting.html">shot sixteen times</a> by Officer Jason Van Dyke. The shooting was captured on video, and Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder last month.</p>

<p>Following the Grand Central reading, the group staged a 16 minute die-in at Sacks Fifth Avenue before crossing the street to Rockefeller Plaza with the intention of marching and chanting through its center. </p>

<p>Kim Ortiz, 31, a lead organizer for NYC Shut It Down, was among the arrestees. She says that she and about a dozen other protesters were pushed out of Rockefeller Plaza around 8:30 p.m. The group had already been split at the plaza&apos;s east entrance, where NYPD officers speedily erected metal barricades, barring half of the protesters.</p>

<p>The arrests took place when the protesters inside the plaza attempted to exit, and continue their march. </p>

<p>Activist Keegan Stephan, who documented the incident on Twitter, says that the arrests were simultaneous. &quot;We were leaving the plaza and they put up barricades blocking off the entrance,&quot; he recalled. &quot;They grabbed all five people at once and took them to the ground.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I got thrown like a rag doll,&quot; Ortiz said this morning. She was on her way to the emergency room, concerned about swelling to her right wrist, and soreness and bruising to her arm. &quot;They grabbed me and twisted my right arm like it was Play-Doh.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It was mostly women who got arrested,&quot; she added. &quot;M.J. [Williams, the attorney] had blood on the side of her cheek.&quot; </p>

<p>Cleo Jeffryes, 22, was among the group of protesters barred from the plaza, and met the barricaded group at the north entrance. &quot;I saw MJ getting thrown to the floor and next thing you know I was thrown to the floor,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I remember my arms being pulled and yanked. The officers didn&apos;t say a word to me.&quot; </p>

<p>Stariyon Ambroiss-Smith, 17, was also thrown to the ground. &quot;It was like a scene out of WWF,&quot; Stephan said. &quot;There was one cop who was exclusively restraining her legs so she couldn&apos;t get up.&quot; </p>

<p>According to an NYPD spokeswoman, the five arrestees were observed pushing through metal barriers at Rockefeller Center and prohibiting pedestrian trespass. They were subsequently charged with a combination of obstructing governmental administration, criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest. </p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the arrests, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402221524/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/5-busted-climb-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-article-1.2466165">multiple</a> news outlets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402221524/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Rockefeller-Center-Christmas-Tree-Protesters-Laquan-McDonalds-NYC-Manhattan-NYPD-362323031.html">reported</a> that three of the arrestees had attempted to climb the Rockefeller Christmas tree.

<p>&quot;It&apos;s ironic that the NYPD has not learned from the Laquan McDonald case,&quot; said Williams this morning. She was transported to the emergency room at Mount Sinai Hospital following her arrest last night, and treated for the scrape on her cheek. </p>

<p>&quot;The NYPD went berserk and violently arrested demonstrators who were standing on a sidewalk outside of Rockefeller Plaza,&quot; Williams added. &quot;There are consequences for the police when they attempt to cover up their outrageous actions... that are clearly contradicted by video evidence.&quot; </p>
