<p>Cooper Union, the historically-free college of art, architecture and engineering in Cooper Square, will continue to charge tuition in the short term but will transition back to a tuition-free model &quot;as soon as practical,&quot; following a supreme court judge&apos;s decision on Wednesday. </p>

<p>&quot;[The trustees] may have lost sight of Peter Cooper&apos;s ideals, including that of free education,&quot;  Justice Nancy Bannon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222111/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/nyregion/judge-lets-cooper-union-levy-tuition-in-short-term.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">wrote</a> in her 25-page opinion. </p>

<p>However, &quot;If the Cooper Union is unable to charge tuition in the short term, the school&apos;s viability would be significantly jeopardized.&quot; </p>

<p>Peter Cooper, a self-taught industrialist, inventor, and philanthropist, founded Cooper Union in 1859. He never had formal schooling, and believed that education should be &quot;as free as air and water.&quot; Since the fall of last year, new students matriculating at Cooper Union have paid $20,000 per year&#x2014;the equivalent of a 50% scholarship. This fall, according to the school, about 25% of the freshman class got full scholarships because of financial need.</p>

<p>Bannon&apos;s opinion solidifies a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222111/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/15/cooper_union_tuition_battle.php">September settlement</a> between Cooper Union&apos;s Board of Trustees and the Committee To Save Cooper Union (CSCU), a group of alumni and faculty that sued the historically-free school last fall over alleged mismanagement and its decision to charge. </p>

<p>Cooper Union&apos;s tuition decision also prompted Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222111/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/cooper_union_investigation.php">investigate the school&apos;s finances</a>. </p>

<p>In 1999, Cooper Union had a $10 million deficit, exacerbated by the construction of $100 million 41 Cooper Square and alleged mismanagement of the land underneath the Chrysler building, the school&apos;s largest asset. By 2011, the deficit had ballooned 60% to $16 million&#x2014;a development that former-president Jamshed Bharucha disclosed three months after his arrival that summer. </p>

<p>This spring, as details of the school&apos;s financial trouble spread, Bharucha and five board members who had long been his vocal supporters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222111/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/11/cooper_union_president_resigns_amid.php">stepped down</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;The view is that the board is changing,&quot; Scott Lerman, &apos;81, a strategic advisor for CSCU said in September. &quot;Some of the most vocal anti-free-tuition people are gone. Others don&apos;t really believe it&apos;s possible to be free, but they&apos;ve agreed to something that we never thought they would agree to.&quot;</p>

<p>A new Free Education Committee of students and alumni was established last month, and two voting students and two voting alumni were added to the board. Following yesterday&apos;s decision, an independent financial monitor will be instated to oversee the board&apos;s spending. Schneiderman will reassess the school&apos;s finances in the spring of 2018.</p>

<p>Cooper Union spokesman Justin Harmon told us this fall that the board supports returning to a tuition free model. However, the financial &quot;hurdles&quot; are still &quot;large.&quot; </p>

<p>In a statement issued on Wednesday, Board Chair Richard Lincer wrote, &quot;We are pleased to have the court&#x2019;s formal approval on an agreement that... establishes a formal mechanism to evaluate the feasibility of returning The Cooper Union to a full-tuition scholarship model.&quot; </p>
