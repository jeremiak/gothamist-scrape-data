<p>Police have released images of the man they believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161015093914/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/west_village_anti_gay_attack.php">yelled homophobic slurs at another man</a> in the West Village earlier this month before shoving him from behind into the window frame of a West 4th Street tapas bar. The NYPD is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, a 32-year-old man was walking on West 4th Street between Jones and Cornelia streets just after 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, October 2nd, when a man in his mid-20s approached him and began yelling homophobic slurs. The younger man then allegedly pushed the 32-year-old from behind, causing him to fall and hit his head on the window frame of Las Ramblas, a tapas bar at 170 West 4th Street.</p>

<p>Police have acquired surveillance footage of the incident. A spokesman for the department could not say what prompted the attack. </p>

<p>As for the slurs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161015093914/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-hunt-brutish-bigot-pushed-man-west-village-attack-article-1.2819914">the Daily News reports</a> that they were racial as well as homophobic: the suspect allegedly shouted &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;nigger&quot; before pushing the victim from behind. </p>

<p>The suspect is believed to be about 6&apos;0&quot; tall and 240 pounds. He was last seen wearing a black t-shirt, black pants, and black sneakers.</p>
