<p>A 31-year-old man grabbed onto the passenger side of an SUV in Soho on Wednesday night and was briefly dragged as the driver sped away, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>The incident took place around 11:30 p.m., outside 347 West Broadway between Spring and Broome Streets. A witness told police that the man approached the vehicle, a Chevy, on the driver&apos;s side and reached inside. The driver then allegedly &quot;sped away&quot; northbound on West Broadway with the victim holding onto the vehicle, according to the NYPD. It wasn&apos;t immediately clear how long the man held onto the vehicle before falling to the street.</p>

<p>A 57-year-old Soho woman said that she was on the east side of West Broadway that night, walking north, and witnessed the incident. &quot;I heard the screaming and the vehicle before it was past me. It was screaming, screaming, screaming,&quot; the woman said, on the condition of anonymity. &quot;Then the car passed and I saw something coming from the vehicle that I thought was a garbage bag being tossed from the vehicle.&quot; </p>

<p>The woman said that the driver appeared to be speeding, and that the car tires were squealing. She said she turned back and saw a body lying in the street. &quot;There was a guy in a suit who helped him and he was covered in blood,&quot; she added. &quot;I saw the [victim&apos;s] bloody jacket.&quot; </p>

<p>It was not immediately clear why the victim approached the driver, or if the two people knew each other. The NYPD also could not confirm if the driver was driving in excess of the speed limit. </p>

<p>The victim sustained a laceration to the back of his head and pain throughout his body, according to the NYPD. He was transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>Police have the vehicle&apos;s license plate number and an investigation is ongoing, according to the NYPD. No arrests have been made as of Friday morning. <br>
