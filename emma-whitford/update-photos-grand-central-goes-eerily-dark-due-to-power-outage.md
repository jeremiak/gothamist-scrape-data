<p>The authority added that some ticket machines &quot;may be affected,&quot; and that trains schedule to arrive on the station&apos;s lower level are being rerouted to the upper level. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801212909/http://pix11.com/2016/02/15/power-outage-at-grand-central-terminal/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">According to PIX11</a>, only the terminal&apos;s main entrance is open. All trains are running on time, albeit on a holiday schedule for Presidents Day. </p>

<p>For commuters likely already sad to be working on a government holiday, passing through the darkened halls has been decidedly spooky.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A spokesman for the MTA confirmed that today&apos;s power outage was caused by a broken water pipe in a &quot;non-public&quot; area of the terminal. According to Grand Central&apos;s official twitter, all terminal stores are closed until further notice, as well as the terminal entrances on Lexington Avenue. Trains are still running on a normal holiday schedule without delays, but The Darkness has not yet been lifted. </p>
