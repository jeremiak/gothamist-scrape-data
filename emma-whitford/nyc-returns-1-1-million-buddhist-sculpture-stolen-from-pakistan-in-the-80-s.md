<p>A Japanese art dealer was arrested at an Upper East Side hotel last month for a highly-specific crime&#x2014;back in 1982, he purchased a stolen second-century Buddhist sculpture with a market value of $1.1 million. Manhattan D.A. Cy Vance&apos;s office and Homeland Security teamed up to seize the carved 440-pound artifact, and today Vance announced its return to Pakistan&#x2014;where it had been lifted from an archeological dig site&#x2014;under the approving gaze of Pakistani ambassador Rizwan Saeed Sheikh. </p>

<p>&quot;This sculpture and others like it are so much more than commercial property&#x2014;they represent ancient pieces of history and culture that should be celebrated and vigorously protected,&quot; said Vance in a statement. </p>

<p>Tatsuzo Kaku, a 70-year-old art and ancient artifacts dealer from Tokyo, was arrested on March 14th at the Mark Hotel on East 77th Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912053335/http://nypost.com/2016/03/22/antique-dealer-arrested-for-smuggling-ancient-sculpture/">according to the Post</a>. He had apparently just agreed to ship the sculpture to the States to be sold at the Maitreya Inc. Gallery on East 75th Street, as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912053335/http://www.asiaweekny.com/">Asia Week New York</a>. </p>

<p>According to the DA&apos;s office, objects like the Buddhapada sculpture are protected under Pakistani law as &quot;cultural property.&quot; This particular piece is from the Swat region of Pakistan, and depicts &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912053335/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_footprint">footprints of the Buddha</a>&quot;&#x2014;symbolic reminders that Buddha once walked the earth. </p>

<p>Kaku pleaded guilty to criminal possession of stolen property on March 24th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912053335/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/arts/design/law-enforcement-focuses-on-asia-week-in-inquiry-of-antiquities-smuggling.html?_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, Asia Week New York is actually a gold mine for stolen artifacts&#x2014;daily raids at this year&apos;s event turned up a handful of artifacts, all of which were looted from overseas. And <em>those</em> were just a drop in the bucket for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912053335/https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-recovers-stolen-indian-artifacts-major-auction-house-ahead-asia-week-new-york">Operation Hidden Idol</a>, which has recovered more than 2,600 items over the last nine years. </p>
