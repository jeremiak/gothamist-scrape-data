					<p>Angel Bunting, 33, stood inside a teal-colored &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/09/dazd_confused_times_square.php#photo-1">Designated Activity Zone</a>&apos; on the corner of Broadway and 45th Street on Thursday afternoon, bare chest painted red, white and blue, talking to a reporter about the NYPD. For two weeks now, beat cops have enforced the eight 10&apos; x 50&apos; painted boxes where Bunting and her fellow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/tags/desnudas">desnudas</a>, as well as costumed characters, dance teams, CD hawkers and mimes, are now confined to solicit tips. &quot;They&apos;re being pretty lenient at first,&quot; she said.  </p>

<p>As Bunting spoke, a middle-aged woman stepped up from behind, technically outside the zone, and crouched beside the desnuda&apos;s thonged butt. &quot;Excuse me!&quot; Bunting said, realizing that the tourist was snapping a free picture. &quot;Excuse me! <em>Excuse</em> me! Rude!&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;You can&apos;t do that sweetheart,&quot; said Bunting&apos;s friend and fellow-desnuda Amanda Roman, 24, as the tourist stepped sheepishly away. </p>

<p>It&apos;s more difficult for the desnudas to shun freeloaders now that they&apos;re confined to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/times_square_disney_crackdown.php">Times Square Alliance&apos;s</a> zones, the women said. &quot;If you&apos;re taking pictures of me [from outside the zone], if you&apos;re taking video of me, I can&apos;t be like, &apos;Hi can I get a tip for what you&apos;re doing?&apos;&quot; Bunting explained. &quot;Like, I do anyway obviously... but if the cops see me they&apos;re like, &apos;No, no, no you can&apos;t do that.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Before the zones, if one of the women caught someone photographing them from across the plaza, they could try to negotiate. &quot;If I&apos;m not in a box and I see someone taking a picture over there,&quot; Bunting explained, pointing, &quot;I can walk over and say, &apos;Well, just take a selfie with me.&apos; Now I have to be like, &apos;Come to my box.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Last summer, Bunting, Roman, 24, and Saira Nicole, 30, were at the center of a tabloid-fueled quality of life crisis. Beyond the bare breasts, complaints about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/18/de_blasio_fears_elmo_nipples.php">aggressive tip solicitation</a> proliferated. Mayor Bill de Blasio moralized that as &quot;a human being and a parent&quot; he didn&apos;t think women should &quot;display themselves this way,&quot; and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/20/deblasio_pedestrian_plazas.php#photo-1">entertained</a> NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton&apos;s suggestion to &quot;dig the whole damn [plaza] up.&quot; Ultimately, the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/times_square_desnudas.php">launched a task force</a> to address complaints about aggressive tip solicitation, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/26/law_order_desnudas.php">reinforcement cops</a> were assigned to Times Square. In August, when Roman&apos;s boyfriend and self-described assistant Chris Olivieri was arrested on the plaza, the women say cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/24/nypd_officers_took_painted_womens_c.php">confiscated their street clothes and interrogated them in their robes</a>.</p>

<p>Undeterred, they painted their bodies with words like FREEDOM and EQUALITY.</p>

<p>&quot;A woman&apos;s body is always going to be commercialized,&quot; Nicole told us at the time. &quot;But as soon as a woman takes control and says I&apos;m going to commercialize myself, that&apos;s a problem.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="063016Desnudas4.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/063016Desnudas4.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Roman in the DAZ (Scott Heins / Gothamist). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>The group said Thursday that their daily earnings haven&apos;t taken a dip compared to last year. In the first two weeks of the enforcement, they haven&apos;t been fined, or even seen any tickets administered. Cops don&apos;t mind if they wander from the zones, as long as they&apos;re not making transactions. (Earlier this month, when a reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/09/dazd_confused_times_square.php#photo-1">asked</a> NYPD Times Square Commanding Officer Captain Robert O&#x2019;Hare if a desnuda could walk outside a DAZ if she wasn&apos;t asking for money, O&apos;Hare nodded.) </p>

<p>Still, the zones feel tense. There are several small groups of desnudas on the square, and Nicole accuses some of them of making &quot;improper or not as classy poses.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Everyone sees red, white and blue and feathers, and it&apos;s like we&apos;re all together,&quot; she said. &quot;So if one girl from a set we don&apos;t really participate with is doing things, it&apos;s like we all do it. Whereas before we could say, &apos;Okay, we&apos;ll stay on this side of the block, you&apos;ll stay on that side.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Then there are the costume characters they say dive into their pictures and demand tips&#x2014;some characters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/times_square_freedom_cage.php#photo-1">had similar grievances</a> last week&#x2014;and the mimes and magicians who take up most of the zone when they&apos;re putting on a show. &quot;If anything it makes it even more hostile [than] last year,&quot; Bunting said. &quot;The emotions are running high.&quot;  </p>

<p>A new Desnuda in Bunting&apos;s group, who gave her name as C., worked at a pharmacy until earlier this summer, when she met Roman and the others on the square. (&quot;I was just chilling, and Angel was like, &apos;You want to come work with us?,&quot; she recalled.) </p>

<p>C. said on Thursday that being confined makes her feel nervous. &quot;It puts us on the map,&quot; she said. &quot;A lot of people don&apos;t like seeing us like this. That&apos;s their prerogative. But when people come and threaten us, you can just Google Map us and see exactly where we are at any time.&quot; </p>

<p>C. said she hasn&apos;t been threatened personally, but that last week someone told Olivieri that he had a gun. &quot;If someone was to leave a suitcase here unattended&#x2026;&quot; she trailed off. &quot;You know what I mean?&quot; </p>

<p>For Bunting, the placement of the zones adds insult to injury. </p>

<p>&quot;The ideal spot is where they won&apos;t let us be now,&quot; she said, pointing across 45th Street towards the army recruitment station. &quot;You get the good views there, and you know that&apos;s where people are going to congregate. That&apos;s where the most money is. Here it&apos;s just passersby.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They [the Times Square Alliance] knew exactly what they were doing,&quot; she added. </p>

<p>This week, the Department of Transportation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070015/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/30/how_much_daz_is_too_much_daz.php">widened the zones by two feet</a>, to provide performers with a bit more space. </p>

<p>&quot;We have always wanted these rules to be a system that works for everyone, including New Yorkers who commute to work in Times Square each day, as well as the people trying to make a living on the plazas,&quot; said a Times Square Alliance spokesperson.  </p>
