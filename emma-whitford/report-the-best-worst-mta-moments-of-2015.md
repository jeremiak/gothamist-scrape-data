<p>It has been a year of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/29/mta_de_blasio_money.php">dire warnings</a> from the MTA&#x2014;letters penned by MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/24/mta_money_cuomo.php">City and the State</a> repeatedly reminded politicians that the public transit system is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/mta_subway_report_card.php">crumbling</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/20/obvious_confirmed.php">bursting</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/03/mta_2nd_ave_subway.php">unable to extend itself</a>, much less <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/l_train_pain_same.php">maintain itself</a>. Also in 2015: Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/de_blasio_2nd_ave_subay.php">pointed fingers</a> at each other; a capital plan was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/at_last_cuomo_and_de_blasio_have_ag.php">finally funded</a>, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/mta_capital_plan.php">delayed</a>; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/14/7_line_hudson_yards_open.php">new station opened</a>, and the groundbreaking date on several others was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/east_side_access_photos.php#photo-1">pushed back</a> indefinitely. Ultimately, de Blasio committed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/04/city_matches_mtas_funding_request_m.php">more city money</a> to the ailing system than any mayor before him. </p>

<p>On the roads, express select buses proliferated. City bus drivers killed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/03/mta_bus_driver_arrested_in_fatal_hi.php">multiple</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/26/mother-of-six_fatally_struck_by_mta.php">pedestrians</a>, while the bus drivers&apos; union, TWU Local 100, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/24/bus_drivers_right_way.php">successfully challenged the Right of Way law</a>. Nevertheless, at least two MTA bus drivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/21/mta_bus_driver_arrested_for_killing.php">have been arrested</a> since the union&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/bus_drivers_right_of_way.php">settlement with the city</a>. Underground, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/02/classic_l_train_such_a_cut_up.php">L train was late</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/12/mta_blames_g_train_derailment_on_la.php">G train derailed</a>, and a rat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/21/pizza_rat.php">dragged a slice of pizza</a>. We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/25/secret_g_train_portal_whoa.php">explored a mysterious G train portal</a>, and, just in time for the new year, dreams of a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/02/mta_freedom_ticket_plan.php">Freedom Ticket</a>&quot; whispered through the city&apos;s transit deserts. </p>

<p>There&apos;s a lot of nail biting, mourning, and dashed hopes to sift through here, but luckily the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://www.straphangers.org/">Straphangers Campaign</a> has issued its annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://www.straphangers.org/bestworst2015/bestworst2015.pdf">Top Ten Worst and Best List for NYC Subways and Buses in 2015</a>&#x2014;a ranking that&apos;s like a delayed rush hour C train down memory lane. </p>

<p>Straphangers Campaign attorney Gene Russianoff said, &quot;On truly bad days, a subway and bus ride can feel like surviving the ten plagues. On good days, navigating the system is thankfully less daunting, but always challenging.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ll start with the good news. </p>

<p><strong>Top Ten Best NYC Transit Events In 2015</strong></p>

<p>1. The best transit moment of 2015 was reaching an agreement on a 5-year, $26 billion capital program to invest in the future of New York transit, backed by Governor Cuomo&apos;s pledge.</p>

<p>2. As part of the deal, the City of New York agrees to quadruple its support of MTA rebuilding to $2.5 billion, as this trillion-dollar asset is key to New York City&apos;s economy and quality of life.</p>

<p>3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://www.wsj.com/articles/mta-looks-to-n-j-to-fill-subway-bus-post-1446573340">Veronique &quot;Ronnie&quot; Hakim</a> is chosen president of New York City Transit, which operates the city&#x2019;s buses and subways. A respected 20-year MTA veteran, she&apos;s the first woman to hold this key post.<br>
 <br>
4. MTA starts new bus routes in Brooklyn and Queens like the non-stop Q70 Limited between LaGuardia Airport and the subway.<br>
 <br>
5. The City is on target to meet its pledge of 20 Select Bus Service routes by 2017. Recent additions: M86 SBS crosstown in Manhattan and Q44 SBS serving Jamaica, Flushing and the Bronx.<br>
 <br>
6. A record year: 6,217,621 riders enter subways on Thursday, October 29, 2015.<br>
 <br>
7. In encyclical, Pope Francis laments that transit riders must put up with &quot;undignified conditions due to crowding, inconvenience, infrequent service and lack of safety.&quot;<br>
 <br>
8. Developer SL Green agrees to spend $220 million improving an overcrowded Grand Central subway station in exchange for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/29/grand_central_air_rights_fight.php">zoning permitting greater density</a>.<br>
 <br>
9. The first new subway station since 1989 opens at 11th Avenue and West 34th Street on the 7.<br>
 <br>
10. MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast asks MTA staff to be more open to outside ideas. Recently, two riders groups have proposed: 1) the &quot;Freedom Ticket,&quot; which would be good for unlimited rail, subway, and bus trips within the city; and 2); and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/lga_shuttle_bus.php">free shuttle</a> between the subways and LaGuardia Airport (Riders Alliance). </p>

<p>And on with the bad. </p>

<p><strong>Top Ten Worst NYC Transit Events In 2015</strong></p>

<p>1. The subways are in a slump, say both riders and the MTA&apos;s own performance measures. The ability to respond is limited by the system&apos;s age and needed resources.<br>
 <br>
2. Chief among riders&apos; complaints: severe crowding. NYC Transit admits: &quot;We are seeing a system that is bursting at the seams in terms of increased ridership.&quot;<br>
 <br>
3. In March, the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/25/metrocard_math_fare_hike.php">raised fares</a> on subways and buses by a quarter, to $2.75, and the cost of a 30-day MetroCard by $4.50 to $116.50.<br>
 <br>
4. MTA proposes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/29/manhattan_mini_storage_ads_ok_tho.php">ban all &quot;political&quot; ads</a> from City&apos;s buses, trains and stations, continuing the agency&apos;s long hostility towards free speech in the subways.<br>
 <br>
5. In the past year, subway riders were less satisfied: 74% o.k. with service now, down from 78% in 2014. Lower marks on frequency and reliability, finds the MTA&apos;s survey.<br>
 <br>
6. The front car of a G-train carrying 150 passengers derailed south of the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station in downtown Brooklyn, resulting in minor injuries.<br>
 <br>
7. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">Viral sensation</a> &quot;Pizza Rat&quot; drags a slice on the subway, instantly capturing the darker imaginations of riders.<br>
 <br>
8. No new cars on the J/Z until 2022 following upstate manufacture Bombardier&apos;s announcement of design and financial problems. This delay will cost the MTA $50 million. <br>
 <br>
9. Labor unrest roils MTA&apos;s paratransit Call Center. Complaints by workers against private contractor range from bedbugs to wages, which run $9 to $11 an hour.<br>
 <br>
10. The tragedy of pedestrians being hit by buses continued in 2015. One response: new buses that further reduce conflicts by addressing a blind spot drivers have long bemoaned. Another: legislation clarifying who has the right of way. </p>

<p>As a notable mention in the Worst category&#x2014;since the list traditionally focuses on buses and subways&#x2014;the Campaign included the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/03/fatal_metro_north_crash.php">Metro-North train that struck a passenger vehicle at a railroad crossing</a> in Valhalla, Westchester County in February. Six people were killed in the crash, which Governor Cuomo later called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/04/fatal_metro-north_crash.php#photo-1">as gruesome as I have seen</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year, when all was said and done, Russianoff told us that the Campaign&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/29/nyc_mta_2014_review.php">#1 Hope for 2015</a> was a fully-funded five year MTA capital plan&#x2014;a massive goal that was achieved this year, with some asterisks.</p>

<p>Today, he expressed a degree of satisfaction. &quot;2015 was round one, and we&apos;re great,&quot; he told us this morning by phone. &quot;The capital plan was the MTA chairman&apos;s top priority for the year, and he did the best that he could do.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Round two is [finding the funding] in Albany, where I think we&apos;ll do well, but there&apos;s the thorny issue of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233225/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/mta_capital_plan.php">how to also fund</a> upstate road and bridge repair,&quot; he added. &quot;The thing I&apos;m sure of is that the governor made a pledge, and he has every political reason to keep it.&quot; </p>

<p>Presented with this year&apos;s list, the MTA declined comment. </p>
