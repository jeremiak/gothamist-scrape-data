<p>The NYPD blocked off a stretch of Fulton Street in Bed-Stuy between Bedford and Nostrand Avenues around 2:30 p.m. today, while a lone protestor stood on a narrow ledge over the marque of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/squatters_theater.php">the Slave Theater</a> for about two hours. </p>

<p>The protester has since been removed to the 79th precinct stationhouse for questioning, according to witnesses. </p>

<p>Omar Hardy, a Brooklyn resident, says that his father Clarence Hardy, 81, staged the protest this afternoon because he believes that he is the rightful owner of the building. </p>

<p>&quot;My father was inside of the theater... because they are trying to steal his building,&quot; he told us by phone from the scene. </p>

<p>Neighbor Karina Leung told us that Fulton Street was still blocked off in front of the theater shortly after 5:00 p.m. &quot;There is still police tape up, and the people who claim they own the building are arguing [with the police],&quot; she said. </p>

<p>Ownership of the property has been contested for years. In 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/nyregion/the-slave-theater-in-brooklyn-at-center-of-bitter-battle-over-ownership.html">the NY Times detailed</a> that Hardy, then 77 and the self-described &quot;chief of the Slave Theater,&quot; believed himself the rightful owner. </p>

<p>Hardy claims that ownership fell to him following the death of one Judge John L. Phillips Jr., a judge who was given court-order guardianship of the theater, and subsequently died without a will. </p>

<p>One Reverend Samuel Boykin, the administrator of the late Phillip&apos;s estate, has reportedly been attempting to evict Hardy from the space <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/squatters_theater.php">since 2010</a>, and has described the Hardy family as &quot;squatters.&quot; Until 2012, Hardy was known for a concession stand and DVD collection he sold out of the theater space. </p>

<p>The Slave Theater, recognizable for its bold &quot;SLAVE #1&quot; signage, has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/nyregion/the-slave-theater-in-brooklyn-at-center-of-bitter-battle-over-ownership.html">shuttered since 1998</a>, but had a lengthy history of civil rights organizing in the 1980s&#x2014;after a black man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/nyregion/black-man-dies-after-beating-by-whites-in-queens.html">was beaten to death</a> in Howard Beach in 1986, Reverend Al Sharpton started hosting weekly rallies there. </p>

<p>On November 4th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/11/24/developer-buys-iconic-slave-theater-site-in-bed-stuy/">the Real Deal reported</a> that the theater, along with two adjacent lots, had been sold to developer Eli Hemway for $18.5 million.</p>

<p>Hardy&apos;s son believes that the deal was fraudulent. &quot;These so-called developers transferred the property from a dead man&apos;s name,&quot; he said, referring to Phillips. &quot;The building has never been for sale. A dead man cannot buy or sell property.&quot; </p>

<p>A group called The Children of Slaves and Patriots recently launched a Change.org petition to &#x201C;save&#x201D; the theater. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/https://www.change.org/p/kenneth-thompson-laurie-cumbo-robert-cornegy-tell-brooklyn-da-rescind-the-fraudulent-deed-on-slave-i-theater-and-save-historic-landmark?recruiter=20881450&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share_twitter_responsive&amp;rp_sharecordion_checklist=control">It details their stance</a> that the recent deed signed to Fulton Halsey Holdings is fraudulent.</p>

<p>Hardy says that he and his father were &quot;trying to check on our premises&quot; on November 13th, when they saw dumpsters and construction work underway. As Hardy put it, &quot;A whole bunch of unauthorized work.&quot; Hardy said it was the construction that prompted today&apos;s protest. </p>

<p>Over the last two weeks, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185641/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ComplaintsByAddressServlet?requestid=1&amp;allbin=3052948">number of Department of Buildings complaints</a> have cropped up on the lot, including construction work and excavation without a permit. </p>

<p>One complaint filed on November 23rd reads: &quot;Construction is being done without a permit, and this is unsafe to the community and taking away a historic landmark.&quot; </p>

<p>The NYPD did not have any preliminary information on the incident. Hardy was still on the scene at 5:30, but said that he would be leaving soon to go check on his elderly father at the 79th Precinct. We will update with any additional information. </p>
