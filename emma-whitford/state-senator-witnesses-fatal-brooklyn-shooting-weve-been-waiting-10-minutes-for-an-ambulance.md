<p>A 28-year-old man was fatally shot on a plaza in front of the Howard Houses in Brownsville on Wednesday afternoon, about a half hour before Senator Jesse Hamilton was scheduled to host a meeting at a nearby community center. The senator witnessed the shooting, and reacted to the scene on Facebook Live.</p>

<p>&quot;A young man was shot right in front of the building where we were having the stakeholders meeting,&quot; Hamilton said. A woman&apos;s cries can be heard in the background, and the camera pans to a cluster of police officers standing around a body on the ground. </p>

<p>&quot;This is unreal,&quot; Hamilton added. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen a young man actually shot and die before my eyes. We&apos;ve been here ten minutes already and there&apos;s no ambulance. And somebody&apos;s dead.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim, Rysheen Ervin, was shot multiple times in the torso, according to police. Cops responded to 80 Osborn Street at the Howard Houses at about 3:11 p.m., and transported Ervin to Brookdale Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s somebody&#x2019;s brother, father,&quot; one witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104842/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-28-shot-dead-brooklyn-housing-project-article-1.2801157">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;Even if you don&#x2019;t know the person, that&#x2019;s a life form.&quot; </p>

<p>No arrests have been made, and an investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>Hamilton went ahead with his scheduled meeting after Ervin was taken to the hospital. He and representatives from about thirty community-based organizations sat to discuss The Campus, a project Hamilton announced back in March, which calls for app development and coding classes in the neighborhood, as well as &quot;health and wellness&quot; classes. </p>

<p>&quot;The goal is to provide a safe haven for kids after school where they can learn about technology, career development, entrepreneurship and wellness,&quot; Hamilton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104842/https://www.facebook.com/jessehamilt3rd/posts/10205593812763008?pnref=story">wrote on Facebook</a> this morning, adding, &quot;We will honor the legacy of this young man.&quot; </p>
