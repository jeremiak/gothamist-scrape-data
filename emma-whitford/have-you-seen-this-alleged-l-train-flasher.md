										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="042216_Flasher.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145447im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/042216_Flasher.jpeg" width="250" height="334"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> (DCPI)</i></div>  The NYPD is hoping the public can help them identify a man who allegedly pulled down his pants and exposed himself to L train riders at the Grand Street station in Williamsburg this week. <p></p>

<p>According to the police, a 30-year-old woman boarded the L train at Grand Street around 12:15 a.m. on Tuesday morning. As she stepped onto the train, she noticed a man in the car wearing black boots and a blue shirt, with his hands inside his green shorts. The man then allegedly pulled down his shorts and exposed himself to the female witness, as well as several other passengers on the train. The police say he exited the train at Union Square. </p>

<p>The suspect is believed to be about 35 years old, and about 5&apos;8&quot; tall. </p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS or for Spanish 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145447/http://a056-crimestoppers.nyc.gov/crimestoppers/public/index.html">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
