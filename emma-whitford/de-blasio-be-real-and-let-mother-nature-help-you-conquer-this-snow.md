<p>Following his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170202033943/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/25/queens_snow_tomb.php">second visit</a> in two days to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170202033943/https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23plowqueens&amp;src=tyah">snow-locked residential streets</a> in Queens, Mayor de Blasio issued an update on snow clearance across the city on Monday, stressing that New Yorkers should exercise patience. </p>

<p>&quot;New Yorkers and impatience go together,&quot; he said. &quot;I will tell people the facts: 27 inches is a lot of snow. We have to be real about the fact that that doesn&apos;t go away overnight.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the City, as of Monday morning the Sanitation Department had plowed &quot;up to&quot; 97% of all NYC streets, including all primary and secondary streets, at least once. DSNY has plowed 96% of all Queens streets&#x2014;a 26% increase since 8:30 p.m. on Sunday. Workers are spread across two 12-hour shifts for 24-hour clearing, with 2,300 workers per shift. </p>

<p>The Parks Department has also deployed 50 plows and more than 60 salt operation vehicles to Queens, and 250 emergency volunteers have been deployed by the city to shovel and dig out hydrants. </p>

<p>De Blasio went on to suggest this morning that some New Yorkers may have contributed to their own snowed-in circumstances by attempting to dig out their cars. &quot;Everyone should hold the city to a high standard, but every resident of the city has a job, too,&quot; he said. &quot;Some people in Queens had very good reasons to use their cars, others could have found a better way.... So much snow accumulated, that a front end loader comes through, the residents go to clear the cars, and they literally reblock their streets inadvertently.&quot; </p>

<p>The City&apos;s stance is that car owners should let the sun do the melting. Alternate side parking has been suspended through Monday, February 1st to encourage this. &quot;Let Mother Nature help you,&quot; the Mayor said. &quot;This is a common sense matter.&quot; </p>

<p>Standing alongside the Mayor, Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stressed that some of the residential streets in Queens are too narrow for plows, and conceded that, as of this morning, some of them had not been touched since an initial pass on Saturday afternoon. </p>

<p>Many Queens streets&#x2014;primarily in the neighborhoods of Woodside, Sunnyside, Ridgewood, Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst and Corona&#x2014;accumulated 20 inches without a plow pass. Today, DSNY will have more than 170 front end loaders in the borough, which push snow forward rather than onto the side of the road. Front end loaders are used to dig up and pile the snow into dump trucks, which then haul the snow away to be melted. </p>

<p>&quot;Our first priority is to begin piling and hauling operations, to put the snow in dump trucks and take it away,&quot; Garcia said. &quot;Our focus is on those [unplowed] streets.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio later balked at a reporter&apos;s question about whether, considering the situation in Queens, praise for city workers might be a bit premature. &quot;They barely get a chance to rest,&quot; he said. &quot;I have tons of praise.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, he stressed that there&apos;s more clearing work to be done. &quot;No one is saying mission accomplished around here,&quot; he said. &quot;What we&apos;re saying is, you can get around this city by and large today.&quot; </p>

<p>As of this afternoon, Queens residents are still documenting impassable roadways. </p>
