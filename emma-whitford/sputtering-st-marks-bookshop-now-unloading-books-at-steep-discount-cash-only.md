<p>Years of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/new_petition_circulates_to_save_st.php">fighting the good fight</a> against soulless East Village landlords and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/the_new_urban_blight.php">depressing empty storefronts</a> has finally caught up with St. Mark&apos;s Bookshop, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/01/st-marks-bookshop-now-facing-eviction-by-the-city/">reportedly facing eviction</a> thanks to $62,000 in unpaid rent as of last December 15th and more than $30,000 in unpaid taxes, among other monetary woes.</p>

<p>The unpaid rent is owed to the New York City Housing Authority, St. Mark&apos;s new landlord at the First Houses at 138 East 3rd Street. The debt reportedly stretches back ten months at St. Mark&apos;s current location (the shop was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/http://ny.racked.com/2014/6/19/7591317/st-marks-bookshop-moving">finally priced out</a> of its Third Avenue home in 2014). </p>

<p>It&apos;s been clear for months that the shop wasn&apos;t in the right financial straights to manage a massive move. In December, the shop launched a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/https://www.gofundme.com/savestmarks">$150,000 gofundme page</a> in the hopes of staying afloat. </p>

<p>Now, St. Mark&apos;s is strapped with a tax lien that must be paid in full&#x2014;the only alternative is bankruptcy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/02/st-marks-bookshop-receives-execution-notice-down-to-final-hours/">Bedford + Bowery reports</a> that a tentative Marshal&apos;s Auction is scheduled for Wednesday, with proceeds on all remaining books going towards the shop&apos;s debt. </p>

<p>In order to keep a bit of cash flowing until the bitter end, the bookshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/https://www.facebook.com/stmarksbooks/">has announced</a> a 50% cash-only sale on all of its books. Cash only, because the shop&apos;s accounts have apparently been frozen&#x2014;on top of rent and tax issues, shop co-owners Bob Contant and Terry McCoy have fallen behind on payments to large-scale book wholesaler Baker &amp; Taylor. </p>

<p>McCoy told Bedford + Bowery this month that he had accrued more than $30,000 in debt with the distributor, after more than 25 years on good terms. Only half of that debt has been paid off, and Baker &amp; Taylor filed suit against St. Mark&apos;s in August. The distributor won, and the account freeze was a condition of the settlement. </p>

<p>&quot;We only have $900-and-some in our bank account,&quot; McCoy said, neatly summing up the depressing situation. </p>

<p>There seems to be one last thread of hope for St. Mark&apos;s, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017160210/http://www.theawl.com/2016/02/the-mystery-money-keeping-st-marks-bookshop-alive">a report from The Awl</a>. A few investors who share the East 3rd Street lease with St. Mark&apos;s are dreaming of reaching an agreement with the City, under which the shop would pay higher rent in exchange for debt relief. Granted, this would mean a new name for the shop, under new ownership, reportedly with McCoy and Contant as employees. </p>

<p>In any case, the St. Mark&apos;s as we know it is open until 10:00 tonight. And since online sales have been suspended, we suggest you walk over there to thumb the pages while you still can. <br>
