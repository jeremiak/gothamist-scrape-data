<p>Seven days after dermatologist and marketing genius Dr. Jonathan Zizmor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/zizmor_no_more.php">confirmed his retirement</a> from the blemish-clearing trade&#x2014;transforming his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/08/dr_z.php">signature subway ads</a> into historical relics&#x2014;the Real Deal is reporting that the notorious physician is being sued for more than $56,000 in unpaid rent on his Midtown medical offices. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="011116_133Zizmor.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/011116_133Zizmor.jpeg" width="300" height="416"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> The entrance to 133 East 58th Street (via Jack Resnick &amp; Sons). </i></div> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://therealdeal.com/2016/01/11/freshly-retired-dr-zizmor-sued-for-unpaid-rent/">According to the Real Deal</a> Jack Resnick &amp; Sons, Zizmor&apos;s former landlord at 133 East 58th Street, filed suit claiming that the dermatologist owed $56,613.66 in unpaid rent on his recently-shuttered office space. <p></p>

<p>Zizmor&apos;s offices were located in suite 811 in the fifteen-story building, which primarily rents to medical offices. Jack Resnick &amp; Sons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://www.resnicknyc.com/commercial/property/133-east-58th-street/663905/overview">describes the property</a> as &quot;newly renovated,&quot; featuring travertine walls, slate flooring, and a concierge. Zillow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/133-E-58th-St-STE-502-New-York-NY-10022/2117547361_zpid/">estimates</a> the rent for a 5th floor suite in the same building to be $10,500/month. </p>

<p>Financial troubles run deep for the doctor with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/11/dr_zizmor.php">fallible face</a>. Zizmor put his Fieldston mansion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/14/dr_zizmors_palace.php#photo-1">on the market</a> in 2012, where it sat for years; currently, Streeteasy indicates that it&apos;s in contract for $3,075,000, significantly less than the original $4.3 million asking price. </p>

<p>Zizmor has also been in the news for shady financial dealings in the past. Back in 2000, he paid a $100,000 fine to the State Department of Insurance after investigators confirmed that he had been collecting from insurance companies on acne surgeries he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/100g-blemish-skin-doc-insurance-fraud-case-settled-article-1.884325">never actually performed</a>. And in 2004, Zizmor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/100g-blemish-skin-doc-insurance-fraud-case-settled-article-1.884325">paid a $40,000 fine</a> to the state Health Department for failure to adequately treat nine of his patients. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for Zizmor was not immediately reachable for comment. However, Zizmor&apos;s realtor Sandra Waibel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/dr-jonathan-zizmor-70-retires-closes-nyc-office-article-1.2484218">spoke to the News</a> last week, making comments that suggest financial security on Zizmor&apos;s part. </p>

<p>&quot;The Zizmors love to travel and have many social interests, hobbies, and friends,&quot; she said. Adding, &quot;Because they are very giving people, I am sure it is only a matter of time before they are involved in their next charitable project.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear what Zizmor&apos;s rent was on the Midtown offices, nor how long he allegedly withheld payments. Jack Resnick &amp; Sons declined to comment. </p>

<p>In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207003038/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/nyregion/dr-zizmor-a-familiar-face-in-new-yorks-subways-has-retired.html">interview with the NY Times</a> last week, Zimor&apos;s wife Alexandra demurred when it came to her husband&apos;s reasons for retiring. He had a &quot;long, long beautiful career,&#x201D; she said, &quot;but everybody retires at some point.&#x201D;</p>
