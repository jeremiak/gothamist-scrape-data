<p>The Port Authority&apos;s board of directors voted unanimously this afternoon to approve its multi-billion contribution to one of Governor Cuomo&apos;s massive infrastructural pet projects&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030131521/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/laguardia_reboot_ferry.php">complete overhaul</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030131521/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/biden_says_laguardias_like_a_third.php">LaGuardia Airport</a>, including a brand-new Terminal B shifted 600 feet closer to Grand Central Parkway, and a central hall that will eventually connect the other three terminals into one continuous structure. </p>

<p>The new airport is also scheduled to connect to Andrew Cuomo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030131521/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/21/cuomos_laguardia_airtrain_will_be_g.php">controversial</a> AirTrain connection from Willets Point, and a ferry terminal. </p>

<p>Thursday&apos;s vote followed hours of heated debate between board members over the exact cost of the project. Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030131521/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/21/yes_only_5_billion.php">reported</a> that the renovation costs had spiked to $5.3 billion&#x2014;a calculation defended today by Port Authority Chairman John Degnan, a Chris Christie appointee. According to Degnan, the original $4 billion price tag is dishonest and misleading to the public, since it doesn&apos;t account for the nearly $600 million that the board already committed to the airport as far back as 2004.</p>

<p>&quot;The news reports are exactly correct,&quot; said Degnan on Thursday. &quot;All of the money was spent in contemplation and support of the [eventual renovation of] Terminal B.&quot; </p>

<p>Port Authority&apos;s executive director, Pat Foye (he&apos;s Cuomo-appointed) argued on Thursday that Degnan was the one misleading the public, insisting that the $600 million shouldn&apos;t be factored into the cost for the <em>very reason</em> that it had been awarded to the airport in years previous. </p>

<p>&quot;The projects that were built at LGA in the past have their own utility,&quot; added Port Authority Chairman Scott Rechler. &quot;For the whole airport I would agree [on the $5.3 billion], but for Terminal B I would disagree. To say it&apos;s a billion dollars more [is comparing] apples and oranges.&quot;</p>

<p>A slide pulled up at the meeting shows the spending breakdown of the project as a whole, designating new and prior authorizations. The board&apos;s direct contribution to Terminal B is $2.9 billion. </p>

<p>Governor Cuomo has heralded the LaGuardia overhaul as a public-private partnership with the private entity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030131521/http://laguardiagatewaypartners.com/">LaGuardia Gateway Partners</a> (LGP), whose lease was approved today as part of the Port Authority vote. LGP is covering two thirds of the cost of development. But Degnan countered that there &quot;is no free money,&quot; and &quot;we&apos;re paying for it all,&quot; pointing out that LGP will reap operating revenues from the new airport that, if the Port Authority had undertaken the project alone, would have gone back into public coffers. </p>

<p>Board Member Ken Lipper also expressed concern about the fine print of the agreement, which authorizes the executive director of the Port Authority to okay any future material changes to the LaGuardia plan, without deferring to the full board for approval. Lipper pushed back so vehemently that the final vote was considerably delayed. &quot;This is public money at a time when we are having incredible problems with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030131521/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/l_train_tunnel_closure_years.php">trust</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030131521/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/03/mta_2nd_ave_subway.php">ability</a> to build public infrastructure,&quot; he said. &quot;[I can&apos;t agree to something] that doesn&apos;t put the board on the hook to protect the public. If we&apos;re not going to take that responsibility, we should resign.&quot; </p>

<p>The board ultimately agreed to amend its process so that the most expensive projects (a specific amount has yet to be set) will not undergo considerable changes without board approval. </p>

<p>Governor Cuomo stated on Thursday that construction of the new airport will begin &quot;shortly.&quot;  Renovations are projected for completion by 2021, with some new sections accessible by 2019. </p>

<p>&quot;This represents a major milestone for the project&#x2014;the first of many&#x2014;and I look forward to seeing construction begin later this year,&quot; he said. </p>
