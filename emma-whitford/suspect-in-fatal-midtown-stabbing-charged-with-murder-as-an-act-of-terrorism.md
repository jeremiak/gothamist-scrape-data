<p>The top charge against James Jackson, the 28-year-old Maryland man suspected of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021151/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/midtown_stabbing_arrest.php">fatally stabbing 66-year-old Timothy Caughman</a> with a sword last week, has been upgraded to first degree murder as an act of terrorism, over second degree murder as a hate crime. He now faces a mandatory life sentence without parole. </p>

<p>Jackson has also been charged with murder in the second degree as an act of terrorism, murder in the second degree as a hate crime, and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. </p>

<p>&quot;James Jackson prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate,&quot; said Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance in a statement Monday. &quot;Last week, with total presence of mind, he acted on his plan, randomly selecting a beloved New Yorker solely on the basis of his skin color, and stabbing him repeatedly and publicly on a Midtown street corner.&quot; </p>

<p>The news comes less than a week after Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021151/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/24/rally_against_hate_crimes_tonight_i.php">called on the DA&apos;s office</a> to upgrade Jackson&apos;s charges. </p>

<p>&quot;This case should establish a new standard,&quot; Adams told Gothamist last week. &quot;Terrorism is not only when someone comes from overseas. It is also domestic born, and we can&apos;t ignore it.&quot;</p>

<p>Jackson took a Bolt bus to New York City last Friday, with the express purpose of targeting black men in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021151/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/22/midtown_stabbing_hate_crime.php">major media capital</a>, according to the NYPD. An army veteran who served for three years in the early aughts, including a tour in Afghanistan, Jackson had allegedly harbored a hatred of black men for nearly a decade. </p>

<p>He allegedly killed Caughman on a Hell&apos;s Kitchen sidewalk shortly before 11:30 p.m. last Monday, stabbing him multiple times with a mini-sword that he later dumped in a Washington Square Park trashcan.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021151/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/23/midtown_hate_crime_stabbing.php">criminal complaint released Thursday</a> includes the substance of an interview conducted by detectives last week. In it, Jackson admitted to killing Caughman as &quot;practice&quot; en route to Times Square to kill more black men.</p>

<p>Jackson also told detectives that he was &quot;angered by black men mixing with white women,&quot; according to the complaint. He doubled down on the sentiment in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021151/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/james-jackson-twisted-regrets-killing-timothy-caughman-article-1.3009736">interview from Rikers Island with the Daily News</a>. Jackson told the tabloid he imagined his killings would deter white women from being in relationships with black men: &quot;&apos;Well, if that guy feels so strongly about it, maybe I shouldn&apos;t do it,&apos;&quot; he extrapolated. </p>

<p>Jackson also told the Daily News that he regretted killing an older man, following up with an explanation steeped in racism. </p>

<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know he was elderly,&quot; Jackson told the tabloid, adding that he would have preferred to kill &quot;a young thug&quot; or &quot;a successful older black man with blonds ... people you see in Midtown. These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path.&quot; </p>

<p>Jackson was charged last Thursday with murder in the second degree as a hate crime. Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon described the act as &quot;most likely an act of terrorism&quot; at the time, though the top charge did not initially reflect this. </p>

<p>In the days since Caughman&apos;s death, activists and politicians have criticized the New York Post and Daily News for including Caughman&apos;s arrest record in its early coverage of the murder. The Daily News later removed Caughman&apos;s arrest history, though the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021151/http://nypost.com/2017/03/21/cops-searching-for-well-dressed-man-in-fatal-midtown-stabbing/">left it up</a>, alongside descriptions of the &quot;dapper&quot; killer.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021151/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/nyregion/james-harris-jackson-timothy-caughman.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;_r=0">moving New York Times profile</a> describes Caughman as a kind man with wide-ranging interests: from religion and philosophy, to celebrity selfies. </p>

<p>Attorney Sam Talkin, who is representing Jackson, declined to comment on the new charges. </p>

<p>&quot;If the facts are anything near what the allegations are, then we are going to address the obvious psychological issues that are present in this case,&quot; Talkin told reporters after the initial charges were announced. </p>
