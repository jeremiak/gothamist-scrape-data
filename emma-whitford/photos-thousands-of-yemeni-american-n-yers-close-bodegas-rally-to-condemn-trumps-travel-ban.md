					<p>Over one thousand Yemeni-American bodega and grocery owners from across the city were scheduled to rally outside Brooklyn Borough Hall at 5:00 on Thursday night, several hours after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/02/nyc_deli_strike_yemen_trump.php#photo-1">rolling down the gates</a> outside their businesses, launching an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/01/yemeni_bodegas_nyc_protest.php">eight hour strike</a> in protest of President Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/no_ban_no_wall_rally.php#photo-1">travel ban</a>. But by mid-afternoon the crowd in Downtown Brooklyn had already swelled. </p>

<p>&quot;By 3:00 there were already about 1,000 people there,&quot; Debbie Almontaser, board president of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://mcnny.org/">Muslim Community Network</a> and a lead organizer of the event, told Gothamist. &quot;When we told them to meet at 4:30, that it was cold and that it was going to be a long program, they said, &apos;There&apos;s nowhere else we want to go.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The crowd doubled and tripled over the next few hours, ultimately reaching between 6,000 and 7,000 people, according to organizers. Before dusk, cold wind whipping, crowds packed the stone steps of Borough Hall, waving large American and Yemeni flags and chanting &quot;No ban! No wall! USA for all!&quot; and, &quot;USA! USA! USA!&quot; </p>

<p>Hassan Daylan, 30, stood in the crowd with his two sons, cousin, and nephews. A Bay Ridge resident of 17 years, he owns two bodegas: one in Greenpoint and another in Washington Heights. &quot;I&apos;m an American Citizen but I have family who are not,&quot; he said. &quot;They left the country to visit father and mother and now they want to come back, but they&apos;re stuck. So it&apos;s a big issue. I&apos;m safe, but other people are not.&quot; </p>

<p>Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">executive order</a>, passed last Friday, barred refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days, and most non-citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days. Syrian refugees are barred indefinitely. Pitched as a national security precaution, the ban was swiftly condemned by many as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/giuliani_trump_muslim_ban.php">blatant anti-Muslim measure</a>, prompting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/refugee_advocates_hold_rally_agains.php#photo-1">mass protests</a> at airports and in cities across the country. </p>

<p>Ali, from the Bronx, said that he was held at JFK for eight hours on Wednesday, without food or water, following a flight from Malaysia (he also asked that we withhold his last name for safety reasons). &quot;I&apos;m a US citizen,&quot; Ali said. &quot;I didn&apos;t expect anything. I showed them my passport, but they didn&apos;t care about me. They looked at me like I was an immigrant. I was the only Yemeni person on the flight.&quot; </p>

<p>While green card holders and US citizens are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/https://www.wsj.com/articles/green-card-holders-are-exempt-from-travel-restrictions-white-house-says-1485710137">exempt</a> from the ban, there have been reports in the past week of legal US residents being held for lengthy questioning, according to attorneys stationed at JFK.</p>

<p>Aside from Bay Ridge, thousands of Yemeni-Americans in New York City live in Flatbush, and Downtown Brooklyn. Opening a bodega or grocery has a been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://citylimits.org/2013/01/07/at-the-corner-deli-a-yemeni-immigrant-saga/">popular choice</a> for recent Yemeni immigrants for more than 50 years, as the work requires no college degree and little overhead. </p>

<p>&quot;Yemenis are nice people, hard-working people,&quot; Daylan, the bodega owner from Bay Ridge, said. &quot;They support their families, they don&apos;t bother nobody, and they&apos;ve been here for a long time.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There is always good and bad, everywhere,&quot; Daylan added, addressing the anti-Muslim messaging in the executive order, and its direct reference to the September 11th, 2011 attacks. &quot;I&apos;m a good Muslim, there is a bad Muslim. There is a good Christian, there is a bad Christian. Whatever happened on 9/11 is so sad&#x2014;same thing that&apos;s happening in my country now.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="020317_Strike.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/020317_Strike.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Gretchen Robinette / Gothamist) </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yemen has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://www.npr.org/2016/12/30/507597705/amid-brutal-civil-war-a-rare-glimpse-at-life-in-yemen">embroiled in civil war</a> since 2015, the same year the United States closed its embassy in the capital city, Sana. That Obama administration decision made it impossible for Yemeni refugees to acquire U.S. visas in their own country, prompting many to travel to Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan and Sudan. Simultaneously, the U.S. has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/14/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia-us-airstrikes.html">increased its involvement</a> in the war, supporting Saudi Arabian airstrikes in Yemen that have destroyed residential neighborhoods and schools. President Trump ordered a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/middleeast/donald-trump-yemen-commando-raid-questions.html">bungled raid</a> in Yemen last week, which left an American commando dead and killed an unverified number of civilians. </p>

<p>&quot;I have my family members back home. They are trying to get here, and some of them went through Djibouti to get their visa,&quot; said Liby Almansourr, 26. &quot;Now they are stuck there waiting to see what will happen after the 90 days.&quot; </p>

<p>A recent Hunter College graduate, Almansourr was among a small group of Yemeni women at the rally. (&quot;It&apos;s no secret that the bodega and grocery store owners are men,&quot; Almontaser, the organizer, said.) </p>

<p>Sarah Newman, 42, saw pictures from the rally on Twitter and hopped on the train from Tribeca to join. She stood out in her pink <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://dcist.com/2017/01/knitters_are_making_pink_pussyhats.php">pussy hat</a>. &quot;I&apos;m going to be wearing my pink hat for four years straight now,&quot; she said, laughing. &quot;I&apos;m a Jewish woman wearing a pink hat at a rally with probably a thousand Yemenite men, with Yemenite flags and American flags and I have goose bumps. I think it&apos;s awesome.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="020317prayer.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/020317prayer.jpg" width="640" height="407"> <br> <i> (Gretchen Robinette / Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Shortly after 5:00 p.m., the crowd broke into long rows across the plaza, facing Northeast towards Mecca, to pray&#x2014;standing, kneeling and bowing in unison. </p>

<p>Afterwards a slew of politicians addressed the crowd&#x2014;borough presidents, city councilmembers, and state assembleymembers. &quot;Those who don&apos;t like Trump put a fist in the air!&quot; shouted Brooklyn Councilmember Jumaane Williams. </p>

<p>The massive rally, Almontaser said, came together extremely quickly. About 20 Yemeni business owners convened an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss the executive order, and decided to figure out some way to demonstrate their power and numbers. &quot;Initially their thought was to do a town hall at a banquet hall,&quot; she explained. &quot;I said, &apos;If you want to make a statement you need to put together a press release and hold a rally.&quot; </p>

<p>Before the crowd dispersed for the night, speakers urged the bodega workers to carry the momentum of the day on into the coming weeks: to participate in know-your-rights trainings  and protest actions. Friday afternoon, another prayer event is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://newyork.carpediem.cd/events/2455481-interfaith-action-jummah-prayer-at-jfk-at-jfk-intl-terminal-4-arrivals/">planned outside JFK&apos;s Terminal 4</a>, where volunteer attorneys are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/https://twitter.com/nobanjfk">still supporting travelers</a> from the banned countries. </p>

<p>&quot;Today is just the beginning,&quot; said Linda Sarsour, executive director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://www.arabamericanny.org/">Arab American Association of New York</a> and a lead organizer of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320085718/http://dcist.com/2017/01/photos_womens_march_is_packed_and_t.php#photo-1">Women&apos;s March on Washington</a>. &quot;You have proven your power. Elected officials would not be here today if they did not recognize your power.&quot; </p>

<p>Makke Dakhlaoui, a 24-year-old hotel manager from the Lower East Side, stood in the crowd while politicians and organizers traded the mic. A Tunisian-American Muslim, he said he had come out in solidarity. &quot;We can&apos;t allow it to get to the point where more Muslim countries are banned, or other countries that just have a little tension with America are just banned,&quot; he said.  </p>

<p>Dakhlaoui added that Trump&apos;s rhetoric has fueled a level of racism and discrimination that he hasn&apos;t experienced since the immediate aftermath of September 11th. </p>

<p>&quot;But the thing that is different now is that people of all communities have come together for Islam, and I&apos;ve never seen the community so strong, and that&apos;s uplifting,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s beautiful and it brings tears of joy to my eyes.&quot; </p>
