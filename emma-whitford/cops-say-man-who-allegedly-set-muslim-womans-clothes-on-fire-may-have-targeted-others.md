										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="091416_Blurry.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160929071012im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/091416_Blurry.jpg" width="320" height="337"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> (DCPI)</i></div> Police said on Wednesday that the man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160929071012/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/12/muslim_hate_crime_fifth_ave.php">allegedly set a Muslim woman&apos;s blouse on fire</a> over the weekend may have targeted three other women on the same night. The man appears to have approached all of the women with a handheld lighter and attempt to spark their clothing. <p></p>

<p>According to the latest information, the three additional female victims were not wearing hijab, unlike the first reported victim. The initial attack announced by the NYPD, against Scotland tourist 35-year-old Nemariq Alhinai, prompted a Hate Crimes Task Force investigation. &quot;Hate Crimes is still looking into it, but it looks like it may not be bias-related,&quot; an NYPD spokeswoman said. </p>

<p>A group of five people&#x2014;two women and three men, including the suspect&#x2014;allegedly approached a woman wearing shorts and long shirt outside of the Tiffany &amp; Co. store at 727 Fifth Avenue around 8:45 p.m. on Saturday. Cops said the suspect approached the victim, who was window-shopping, from behind and appeared to &quot;ignite a lighter next to her leg.&quot; The startled woman was not injured, but quickly headed north towards East 57th Street. The suspect headed south. About fifteen minutes later, 35-year-old Nemariq Alhinai <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160929071012/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/12/muslim_hate_crime_fifth_ave.php">realized that her blouse had been set on fire</a>. She was standing in front of the nearby Valentino store at 693 Fifth Avenue. </p>

<p>Then, around 10:00 p.m., two women on the D/F train platform at Bryant Park said they were approached by a man who &quot;placed&quot; a flame &quot;near their respective arms.&quot; The man, approximately 6&apos;0&quot; and wearing a white t-shirt, fit the description of the attacker in the other two incidents. Police said he was holding a lighter, and was with a group of people. </p>

<p>&quot;You shouldn&apos;t burn people,&quot; one of the women said, according to the police report. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t smoke, you can smell my breath,&quot; the man responded. He and his companions apparently fled when the women got on an arriving F train. </p>

<p>Police released additional surveillance footage of the suspect. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. </p>
