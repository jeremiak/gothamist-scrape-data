<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/04/state_senate_and_assembly_agree_on.php">predicted</a>, the New York State Assembly yesterday approved legislation that would prohibit New York City from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/05/plastic_bag_fee_ny_law.php">instituting a five cent fee</a> on most plastic bags distributed at bodegas and grocery stores. The vote, 122-15, is yet another blow to the fee&apos;s defenders on the City Council, who have argued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/20/bag_ban_photos.php#photo-1">for years</a> that charging for plastic could cut down on the nearly 10 billion non-recyclable bags that clog sewer drains and adorn trees each year, and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://bagitnyc.org/">according to advocates</a>, are hauled out of the city as trash for an estimated $12.5 million annually. </p>

<p>The City Council approved the bag fee last spring, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/05/plastic_bag_fee_ny_law.php">narrowly</a>. It was originally set to go into effect last October, but the Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/plastic_bag_valentines.php">voted to delay implementation</a> after South Brooklyn Senator Simcha Felder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/bag_tax_delay.php">introduced legislation</a> to prohibit an NYC bag fee indefinitely (fee supporters hoped to come up with some sort of compromise, rather than risk total obliteration of the fee). </p>

<p>Felder&apos;s bill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/plastic_bag_tax_senate.php">passed the Senate last month</a>; the Assembly-drafted legislation passed this week is less stringent, delaying further discussion of a fee until January 2018. Rather than automatically implementing the fee next winter, the City Council would have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/state-pols-expected-enact-moratorium-nyc-disposable-bag-tax-article-1.2963633">take it to another vote</a>. </p>

<p>Critics at the state and city level, on both sides of aisle, say the fee will negatively impact poor New Yorkers, for whom seemingly-insignificant charges add up. (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/nyregion/plastic-bags-new-york.html?_r=0">same argument has been made</a> by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://www.plasticsindustry.org/apba">American Progressive Bag Alliance</a>, a consortium of companies that manufacture plastic bags.) Testifying against the fee last month, Felder, a Democrat who caucuses with the Republicans, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/simcha-felder-speaks-for-the-plastic-bags-for-the-bags-have-no-voices-9623959">brought in a plastic bag as a prop</a>, warning against an impending &quot;crisis facing average New Yorkers.&quot; </p>

<p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, also referenced the potential financial burden of the legislation. &quot;It has the potential to negatively impact working poor households and senior citizens disproportionately,&quot; he said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://www.wnyc.org/story/state-lawmakers-oppose-plastic-bag-fee/">in a statement</a>. </p>

<p>The state legislation, which passed the Senate on Monday, is poised to block the fee a week before it was set to go into effect, on February 15th. </p>

<p>It&apos;s now left to Governor Andrew Cuomo to sign off or veto, and his office has yet to indicate a position. Spokesman Richard Azzopardi said Tuesday night that the bill is &quot;under review,&quot; and the Governor himself deflected on Wednesday morning. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At the station, Cuomo took questions from reporters. He said he will review NYC&apos;s bag fee and a bill to block it; he said it&apos;s &quot;complicated&quot;</p>&#x2014; Jimmy Vielkind (@JimmyVielkind) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/https://twitter.com/JimmyVielkind/status/829353093703856129">February 8, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>The current bag fee legislation is a less-stringent version of a bill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/20/bag_ban_photos.php#photo-1">first introduced back in 2013</a>, which would have charged 10 cents per plastic bag. Not to be confused with a government tax, profits from the fee would go directly back to shop owners. (An accompanying five-cent paper fee was included to discourage New Yorkers from simply switching over.) People who use food stamps would not have to pay the extra charge, and bags used to package medication and takeout from restaurants would be exempt, as well as grocery store bags used to wrap up meat and produce.</p>

<p>Bill sponsors Brad Lander and Margaret Chin have argued that the exception for those on public assistance makes the financial burden argument moot. </p>

<p>&quot;The data shows that low-income people are just as capable as middle-income or high-income people of bringing reusable bags,&quot; Lander <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/plastic_bag_tax_senate.php">added recently</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/02/with-albanys-block-of-council-law-some-begin-to-question-speakers-power-109430">A Politico piece published today</a> explores the possibility that City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito bears some responsibility for the bag fee&apos;s near-demise. Quoting a slew of anonymous City Council members critical of the speaker, the piece notes that Mark-Vierito chose not to travel to Albany to defend the bill while it hung in the balance. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not anything about Melissa,&quot; Speaker Heastie countered this week, according to the outlet. &quot;My relationship is as fine as it always is. Sometimes even with the best of friends you have differences of opinion.&quot; </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the City Council did not immediately comment on the anonymous allegations. </p>

<p>When the Senate passed Felder&apos;s legislation barring the bag fee last month, Council Member Lander put his faith the Democratic-majority Assembly, calling on the body to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423041458/https://twitter.com/bradlander/status/821486313689976832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">resist</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We are disappointed that the Assembly decision to ignore the unified voice of New York&apos;s environmental, climate justice and neighborhood groups&#x2014;at the very moment the federal government is rolling back environmental protections,&quot; Lander said in a joint statement with Council Member Chin on Tuesday. &quot;We appeal to Governor Cuomo to help us reach a compromise that would allow New York City to try out this effective, common-sense strategy.&quot; </p>
