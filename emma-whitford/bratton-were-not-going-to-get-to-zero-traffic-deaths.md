<p>Fielding questions from former New York Times executive editor and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/nyregion/how-being-hit-by-a-vehicle-changed-times-colleagues-lives.html?_r=0">traffic crash victim</a> Jill Abramson at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/https://www.transalt.org/getinvolved/vision-zero-now/visionzero2016">2016 Vision Zero Conference</a> on Thursday, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton defended his department&apos;s role in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/vision_zero_2015_de_blasio.php">reducing the number of traffic-related deaths</a> in NYC, while predicting that the initiative&apos;s goal of zero deaths by the year 2024 is unachievable. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re not going to get to zero,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a great goal, and we&apos;re still striving... but the reality of it is much like the reality of crime. As long as we have humans who are walking and riding, bicycles and cars&#x2014;as long as we have people, we will have crime.&quot; </p>

<p>Indeed, Bratton&apos;s opening remarks on Thursday morning were delivered somewhat like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/27/nyc_was_safer_in_2015_than_2014.php">crime statistics press conference</a> at One Police Plaza. Making liberal use of the word &quot;accident&quot; (a banner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/https://www.transalt.org/getinvolved/vision-zero-now/visionzero2016">on the conference website</a> reads &quot;let&apos;s stop saying accident today&quot;), Bratton ran through the numbers: 233 traffic fatalities in 2015, compared to 269 the year previous; 14 cyclist deaths in 2015, compared to 20 the year previous. </p>

<p>Pedestrian injuries are up this year to date&#x2014;38 in total compared to 33 this time last year. However, the Commissioner stressed that summonses are also up&#x2014;28% for speeding, 38% for red lights, 19% for improper turns, 47% for texting. Bratton also emphasized that 400 drivers have been summonsed, and 11 arrested, in 2016 for alleged violations of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/28/cops_to_stop_letting_drivers_get_aw.php">Right-of-Way Law</a>&#x2014;a 2014 law that made failing to yield to pedestrians and cyclists a misdemeanor offense. </p>

<p>Twelve drivers were arrested and charged with misdemeanors for failing to yield in the first four months of that law&apos;s implementation, according to City data. As of last December, a total of 24 had been charged. For comparison, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/https://www.transalt.org/news/releases/8378">report issued that month</a> by Transportation Alternatives found that about 4,000 hit-and-run crashes in 2015 resulted in injury or death. Only 1% of the drivers in those crashes were charged with a crime (advocates have also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/deadly_drivers_nyc.php">blamed the borough District Attorneys</a> for this statistic). </p>

<p>But while Bratton was quick to admit on Thursday that the NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Squad (CIS) is faced with more traffic incidents than it could possibly investigate, additional CIS officers are not part of his 2016 budget plans. &quot;We will not be increasing significantly the number of [CIS] investigators,&quot; he said. &quot;What we have expanded is [their] responsibility.&quot; Indeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/http://www.streetsblog.org/2014/11/12/vision-zero-year-one-an-early-assessment/">until two years ago</a>, CIS only had the jurisdiction to investigate crashes that resulted in death. Now the unit can investigate crashes involving serious injuries as well. </p>

<p>In the coming year, Bratton said that he <em>is</em> going to push for 400 to 500 additional traffic enforcement agents, to supplement the 3,000 currently on the street. With a larger force, the Commissioner says he&apos;ll be better able to mediate traffic congestion around construction sites, and deploy more officers to schools that are short on crossing guards. </p>

<p>Also in 2016, traffic enforcement agents will be able to pull up traffic incident reports on their department-issue tablets. Crash victims won&apos;t have to wait for paperwork processing before filing insurance claims. &quot;We&apos;re going to be much for focused on customer satisfaction,&quot; Bratton said. </p>

<p>Abramson kept pushing the subject of CIS ranks, citing a Transportation Alternatives statistic that out of 3,500 serious traffic injuries in 2015, only 10% were investigated. But Bratton insisted that his department has &quot;many priorities,&quot; including terrorism. </p>

<p>&quot;As crime goes down and it frees up officers from that, there is the potential to expand into other areas, including increased investigations of non-fatal accidents and injury collisions,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Reminding the audience that &quot;traditional crime&quot;&#x2014;encompassing murders, shootings, rapes&#x2014;has decreased 80% since 1990, Bratton stressed that his goal is no different when it comes to traffic incidents. &quot;A death is a death,&quot; he said. &quot;An injury is an injury.&quot; </p>

<p>But asked if he would consider replacing the word &quot;accident&quot; with the word &quot;crash&quot;&#x2014;doing so, advocates argue, would help reinforce the driver&apos;s culpability&#x2014;Bratton said that he would not. &quot;Crashes, accidents you can call them whatever you want. Right now we classify them as accidents,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>And yet, under Bratton&apos;s predecessor Ray Kelly, the NYPD unit that investigates crashes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010853/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/nypd_issues_sweeping_changes_to_cra.php">quite deliberately changed its name</a> from the Accident Investigation Squad to the Collision Investigation Squad in 2013. Maybe Bratton just needs a few more years to catch up.</p>
