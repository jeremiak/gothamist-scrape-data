<p>Officers from the 90th Precinct in Williamsburg have recovered the black Chevy Camaro involved in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010952/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/03/cyclist_killed_by_hit-and-run_drive.php">hit-and-run crash</a> that killed Queens cyclist Matthew von Ohlen early Saturday morning. The driver remains at large following the Wednesday morning discovery. </p>

<p>Police have identified a suspect based off of the vehicle&apos;s registration, and a spokesperson said they are withholding the location where the Camaro was recovered so as not to compromise the ongoing investigation. </p>

<p>Video surveillance recovered from the scene of the crash shows that 35-year-old von Ohlen was riding in a designated bike lane when he was struck shortly after 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, in front of 690 Grand Street in Williamsburg. Law enforcement sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010952/http://pix11.com/2016/07/03/victim-idd-photos-released-of-driver-wanted-in-fatal-williamsburg-hit-and-run/">told Pix11</a> earlier this week that the driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010952/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/04/cops_believe_driver_intentionally_f.php">may have struck von Ohlen intentionally</a>, slowing down and moving into the bike lane to strike the cyclist. </p>

<p>Von Ohlen, a bartender, musician, and co-founder of the bike-repair company Bikestock, was returning from a bar shift at Apotheke in Manhattan when he was killed. </p>

<p>Friends and family mourned the victim on Tuesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031010952/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/06/cyclist_deaths_nypd.php">dedicating a white-painted &quot;ghost&quot; bike memorial</a> at the crash site. </p>

<p>&quot;I lost one of these anchors in my world,&quot; said Logan Gilbert, 35, von Ohlen&apos;s longtime roommate in San Francisco. &quot;But what was so insanely beautiful is that there were so many people I didn&apos;t even recognize or know [at the ghost bike dedication]. He cast a wide net.&quot;</p>
