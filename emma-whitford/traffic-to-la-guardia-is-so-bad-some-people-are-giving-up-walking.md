										<p>Road detours related to the construction of Governor Cuomo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/laguardia_link.php#photo-1">slick new multi-billion vision</a> for LaGuardia Airport are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/https://twitter.com/NY_NJairports/status/767826314309042179">snarling traffic so badly</a> this week that some desperate travelers have chosen to abandon cars and taxis near the Grand Central Parkway off-ramp and roll their suitcases on down to Departures. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/https://twitter.com/katierosman">NY Times reporter Katie Rosman</a> was stuck in yesterday&apos;s mess for two hours, and told the Village Voice that a cop gave her a blunt explanation&#x2014;&quot;We&apos;re building you a new airport, that&apos;s what&#x2019;s going on,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/laguardia-traffic-was-so-bad-today-that-people-walked-to-their-flights-9013648">said</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;This is what the airlines were worried about in the first place, and this is just the first phase,&#x201D; an anonymous &quot;transportation official&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://www.wsj.com/articles/construction-project-snarls-la-guardia-airport-1471047412?mod=rss_newyork_news">told the Wall Street Journal</a> this week. </p>

<p>One Chicago woman&apos;s hope was double-crushed on Monday&#x2014;not only was <em>she</em> trapped on the Parkway en route to LGA, so was her pilot. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://laguardiagatewaypartners.com/project/">LaGuardia Gateway Partners</a> didn&apos;t immediately respond to a request for comment, but project spokeswoman Rebecca Catley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://www.wsj.com/articles/construction-project-snarls-la-guardia-airport-1471047412?mod=rss_newyork_news">assured WSJ</a> that, &quot;The Port Authority regularly and proactively updates their website, provides alerts and updates social media with information about flight and traffic delays.&quot; </p>

<p>Richard Smyth, Port Authority point person for the LGA renovations, also told the paper that Gateway Partners is planning to add temporary roads this fall to mitigate some of the congestion. The construction is likely to go on until 2024, but he is hopeful that new, permanent roads and a new parking garage will improve the flow significantly&#x2014;by 2018. </p>

<p>Until then, the Port Authority has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/https://twitter.com/NY_NJairports/status/768026328394240000">tweeted</a> numerous reminders this week to use public transportation to and from LaGuardia&#x2014;an option transportation advocates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/23/lga_shuttle_bus.php">consider to be severely lacking</a>. Starting this fall, the Q70 bus will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/laguardia_link.php#photo-1">become a select bus route</a>, re-branded as the &quot;LaGuardia Link.&quot; </p>

<p>The Port Authority didn&apos;t immediately comment on the traffic headaches this week, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/laguardia-traffic-was-so-bad-today-that-people-walked-to-their-flights-9013648">told the Village Voice</a> that taxi stands were recently moved away from the drop-off and pick-up areas, in an effort to improve traffic flow. Terminal B, which is used by Air Canada, American Airlines, Envoy Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, and Southwest, also has a new alternative pick-up spot&#x2014;travelers take a shuttle there, from arrivals. </p>

<p>Still, today is already looking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408050804/https://twitter.com/bcbtrek/status/768097140656709632">pretty rough</a>. </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE: 3:45]:</strong> A spokesperson for LaGuardia Gateway Partners issued the following statement: </p>

<blockquote>As construction on the new Central Terminal has gotten underway, a combination of factors have caused traffic delays getting into and out of LaGuardia Airport. We are aware of the stress this is causing, realize it is untenable, and apologize to passengers. We are working around the clock to address this issue as quickly as we can, together with the Port Authority.
 
LaGuardia&#x2019;s congestion issues are not new, and they underscore why the airport needs to be fixed. Our team is committed to improving the current situation and continuing to make the travel experience as seamless as possible while we develop a world-class facility. To help ensure travel plans are not interrupted, travelers should build in extra travel time as they head to LaGuardia Airport.</blockquote>
