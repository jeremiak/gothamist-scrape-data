<p>Sponsors including JetBlue and the New York Yankees joined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170522/civic-center/james-oneill-nypd-puerto-rican-day-parade-oscar-lpez-rivera">NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill Monday</a> in withdrawing participation from the 2017 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/puerto_rican_parade_2016.php#photo-3">Puerto Rican Day Parade</a>. </p>

<p>The collective step back is in response to organizers&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/puerto_rican_parade_2016.php#photo-3">decision</a> to appoint a controversial figure as parade leader. Oscar L&#xF3;pez Rivera, 74, served 35 years in prison for his involvement in the separatist FALN group, which was implicated in more than 100 bombings including the 1975 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170120/civic-center/oscar-lopez-rivera-clemency-fraunces-tavern-bombing-joseph-connor">Fraunces Tavern bombing</a> that killed four people in Downtown Manhattan. Another bombing, on New Year&apos;s Eve 1982, injured three police officers at NYPD headquarters. </p>

<p>President Barack Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170120/civic-center/oscar-lopez-rivera-clemency-fraunces-tavern-bombing-joseph-connor">commuted Rivera&apos;s sentence in January</a>; his house arrest in Puerto Rico reportedly concluded on May 17th. </p>

Last week, Rivera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/nyregion/puerto-rican-day-parade-plants-its-flag-in-disputed-territory.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a> that, &#x201C;I do not have blood on my hands, and that&#x2019;s why I cannot be a terrorist.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/https://www.britannica.com/topic/FALN">FALN</a>, an acronym for Armed Forces of National Liberation in Spanish, sought Puerto Rican independence from the United States. </p>

<p>&quot;As the leading airline in Puerto Rico, JetBlue is proud of its strong relationship with the Puerto Rican community and its long-time sponsorship of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade,&quot; a spokesperson for JetBlue stated Monday. The official statement of withdrawal continued: </p>

<blockquote>It became clear that the debate about this year&apos;s parade was dividing the community and overshadowing the celebration of Puerto Rican culture that we had set out to support. Out of respect for the many different points of view, we will be redirecting our funds to support scholarships for Puerto Rican students in both New York and Puerto Rico. We did not make this decision lightly and hope all sides will come together to engage in a dialogue about the parade&#x2019;s role in unifying the community at a time when Puerto Rico needs it most.</blockquote>

<p>The Yankees also emphasized their continued commitment to scholarships in an official statement. </p>

<p>&quot;The New York Yankees are not participating in this year&#x2019;s Puerto Rican Day parade,&quot; the team stated. &quot;However, for many years, the Yankees have supported a scholarship program that recognizes students selected by the parade organizers. To best protect the interests of those students, and avoid any undue harm to them, the Yankees will continue to provide financial support for the scholarships, and will give to the students directly.&quot; </p>

<p>On Monday afternoon, Commissioner O&apos;Neill reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170522/civic-center/james-oneill-nypd-puerto-rican-day-parade-oscar-lpez-rivera">referred to Rivera as a &quot;terrorist,&quot;</a> and said that he would join the parade. Instead, he plans to visit police officers stationed along the parade route.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot support a man who was a co-founder of an organization that engaged in over 120 bombings, six people killed and seriously injured four police officers,&quot; O&apos;Neill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/http://www.syracuse.com/state/index.ssf/2017/05/ny_yankees_jetblue_pull_support_for_new_york_city_puerto_rican_day_parade.html">said</a>. </p>

<p>Goya Foods, another sponsor, backed out last week, according to a spokesperson. &quot;It was a business decision to not participate in the 2017 Puerto Rican Day Parade,&quot; said Rafael Toro, director of Public Relations for the company. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523171152/https://twitter.com/latinojustice/status/866628337627693056">rallied Monday </a>in support of Rivera, alongside more than a dozen local union chapters and nonprofits. </p>

<p>&#x201C;We support the NY Puerto Rican Day Parade&apos;s decision to honor Oscar L&#xF3;pez Rivera at this year&apos;s parade,&quot; said 32BJ President Hector Figueroa in a statement. &quot;We call on our community to honor all the hard work so many people, including distinguished civic, religious and political leaders, put in for decades to secure Oscar&apos;s release.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;For many,&quot; Figueroa added, &quot;he has represented and continues to represent an unwavering commitment to the well-being of the Puerto Rican people, and it is for this reason, not for necessarily agreeing with or promoting his political views, that he is being honored.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Organizers with the Puerto Rican Day Parade did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>

<p>The New York City Sergeants Benevolent Association issued a press release Monday urging Mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to withdraw their support from the parade. &quot;Any elected or appointed public official who chooses to participate in this blood-soaked commemoration is, in essence, expressing tacit support for the type of deadly behavior that has the entire world on high alert,&quot; SBA President Ed Mullins stated.</p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s Office also did not immediately comment. However, de Blasio has indicated his intention to participate in the parade next month. </p>

<p>&quot;Two presidents, two attorney generals gave him a pardon because he had renounced violence,&quot; de Blasio told reporters at an unrelated press conference last week. &quot;I&apos;m comfortable that he served his time, has made his statement clear, and let&apos;s move on.&quot;</p>

<p>The 60th Annual Puerto Rican Day Parade is scheduled for June 11th. </p>
