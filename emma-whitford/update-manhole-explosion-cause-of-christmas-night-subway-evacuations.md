<p>Hundreds of straphangers were evacuated from the subway late Christmas night after an electrical fire broke out at a MTA power station in Midtown, according to the NYPD. No one was injured, though riders are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228185024/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/26/subway_service_issues_on_b_d_and_e.php">facing residual delays</a> this morning. </p>

<p>The fire broke out around 10:15 p.m. at 126 West 53rd Street, according to the FDNY. Flames spread underground, cutting off third rail power on 7th Avenue and prompting the MTA to shut down multiple train lines (the authority could not immediately be reached for comment). Police and fire fighters proceeded to evacuate three trains: a train near 53rd Street and 7th Avenue (the letter could not be confirmed), an E train near 59th Street and Lexington, and a D train at 34th Street and 7th Avenue.  </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, there 301 on the E train, 260 on the D train, and 60 passengers on the third train&#x2014;621 straphangers total. </p>

<p>FDNY could not confirm what caused the fire Monday morning, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228185024/http://abc7ny.com/news/underground-gas-line-fire-causes-subway-disruptions-in-midtown/1673143/">ABC reports</a> an underground gas line may have started the blaze. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228185024/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/26/nyregion/subways-hobbled-by-power-problem-in-midtown.html?smid=tw-share">NY Times reported</a> a concurrent gas leak in the area, though any connection between the two incidents was not immediately clear. </p>

<p>The E train evacuation took more than two hours, according to a Gothamist tipster who was on board when it stalled between Queens and 53rd Street, around 10:15 p.m. </p>

<p>&quot;We... waited for the FDNY to provide us with ladders to escape from the first car and walk about 400 feet to the platform around 12:15am,&quot; the tipster wrote. &quot;There were quite a few young children and babies, elderly, disabled and homeless folks onboard. Many tourists with luggage and people with holiday bags in tow as well.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Overall the FDNY and NYPD did as good a job as they could do given the circumstances, but the MTA could have done a better job of communicating with passengers and instructing us throughout the investigation,&quot; she added. &quot;Those who did not speak English were not provided with information and there were a few false starts in terms of when the evacuation would actually begin.&quot; </p>

<p>The FDNY extinguished the flames just before 1:40 a.m., corresponding with the final evacuations. </p>

<p>&quot;On the whole it was a crazy end to Christmas Day,&quot; the tipster said. &quot;But standard NYC fare.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[Update: 11:30 a.m.]:</strong> Power was knocked out on 7th Avenue &quot;following a manhole explosion adjacent to the 7 Av station and nearby sub-station forcing a shutdown of third rail power in the area,&quot; according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228185024/https://www.facebook.com/MTANewYorkCityTransit/posts/10154206558324607">a Facebook post from the MTA</a>. </p>

<p>The manhole fire &quot;severely damaged critical electrical components that provide power to several lines serving midtown Manhattan, includng the D, E and F,&quot; the authority continued. </p>

<p>Regular D and E train service has now resumed, following the restoration of F train service earlier this morning. For the latest updates, check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228185024/http://www.mta.info/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 12:30 p.m.]:</strong> A spokeswoman for the MTA said that the cause of the explosion and subsequent fire is still under investigation. </p>
