<p>A 19-year-old NJ woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720212847/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/24/nj_teen_arrested_for_drugging_men_s.php">accused of picking up at least five men in Midtown</a> and robbing them of watches and cash in 2015 has been arrested again on similar charges, having allegedly robbed a JP Morgan executive of luxury watches, gold necklaces, credit cards and at least a grand. </p>

<p>Alexandra Martinez has been accused of convincing 31-year-old financial planner Michael Briese to bring her back to his $1.8 million East Village condo last August, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720212847/http://nypost.com/2016/02/09/teen-temptress-busted-in-yet-another-rolex-heist/">according to the Post</a>. She allegedly waited for her unassuming date to fall asleep before making off with his valuables. </p>

<p>Martinez, who&apos;s got a recognizable &quot;Love yourself so no one has to&quot; tattoo down one arm, was previously arraigned for an incident on July 22nd, when she allegedly swiped a wallet from a man she met at West Village wine bar Gottino. On August 24th, she allegedly went to a victim&apos;s hotel room at the Ritz Carlton and left with his watch. On September 4th, she allegedly met a man at a bar, returned to his condo in Brooklyn Heights, and stole his jewelry box, which contained $40,000 in jewelry, including three Rolex watches and a Breitling. </p>

<p>On at least two occasions, Martinez is believed to have drugged her victims&apos; cocktails to knock them out (although that doesn&apos;t seem to have been the case with Briese). </p>

<p>Martinez was arrested last week, and charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in Manhattan Criminal Court. She&apos;s now out on $40,000 bail. </p>

<p>Prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720212847/http://nypost.com/2015/12/24/teen-allegedly-drugs-robs-older-men-of-their-pricey-watches/">said</a> in December that Martinez and an occasional unidentified accomplice tend to pick their victims based on the quality of their watches. Rolex is a favorite, with which this latest victim was flush. <br>
