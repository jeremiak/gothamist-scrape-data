---

	
										<p>Republican Assemblyman Bill Nojay, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/21/donald_trump_thinks_hes_the_most_po.php">adamant Trump supporter</a> and gun rights advocate representing parts of Rochester and the Finger Lakes region, defeated GOP challenger Rick Milne in Tuesday&apos;s primary election&#x2014;four days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2016/09/09/bill-nojay-dies-assemblyman-radio-show-host/90119840/">his body was discovered</a> in a Rochester cemetery in an apparent suicide. The dead politician handily beat his living challenger 60% to 39%. </p>

<p>This unusual outcome was, it turns out, exactly what local GOP leaders had hoped for. The Hornell Republican Committee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2016/09/gop-committee-urges-vote-for-nojay/">released a statement</a> Sunday urging constituents to vote for Nojay, freeing committee reps from three local counties to select a replacement candidate to run in the November election. &quot;Despite the unexpected and tragic loss of our Assemblyman, the endorsement still stands,&quot; the committee stated. &quot;The Hornell Republican Committee extends its deepest sympathies to Bill&apos;s wife and children in this difficult time.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/nyregion/gop-voters-urged-to-select-dead-assemblyman-in-new-york-race.html">As the NY Times pointed out yesterday</a>, whoever is selected to run will likely take office (a selection is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.rochesterfirst.com/election/ylehq-rochesterhomepage/late-assemblyman-bill-nojay-wins-133rd-district-primary">expected tonight</a>): </p>

<blockquote>The choice of a successor for Mr. Nojay lies with the chairmen of the Republican parties in each of the three counties, whose votes will be weighted according to the percentage of votes cast in each county the last time Mr. Nojay was elected. Given the district&#x2019;s deep Republican bent, whoever ends up with the nomination will most likely go on to Albany next year to join the Republican minority in the Assembly.</blockquote>

<p>Milne, the mayor of Honeoye Falls, has since accused local GOP leaders of flooding constituents with robocalls. &quot;They really did some things in the past few days that were in poor taste in my opinion to sway the vote,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/upstate-assemblyman-died-apparent-suicide-wins-gop-primary-article-1.2791629?utm_content=buffer996d5&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=gkuntzman+buffer">told reporters</a>. </p>

<p>Monroe County Republican Committee Chair Bill Reilich said after the election that the vote in favor of Nojay was in fact an ode to the late assemblyman. </p>

<p>&#x201C;I think voters sent two messages by voting for Nojay. One was to show respect for him and the work he did. The other message was that they wanted a conservative representative,&quot; Reilich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.rochesterfirst.com/election/ylehq-rochesterhomepage/late-assemblyman-bill-nojay-wins-133rd-district-primary">said</a>. &quot;Milne made it clear in interviews with GOP chairs that he was not as conservative as Nojay, but that won&#x2019;t keep his name out of the mix.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>This is not the first time a politician has been elected from the grave. Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/carnahan101700.htm">died in a plane clash</a> in October 2000, only to beat incumbent John Ashcroft for a Senate seat (Carnahan&apos;s widow, Jean Carnahan, ended up taking his place). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-GOP-Lawmaker-Bill-Nojay-Wins-Primary-Days-After-Killing-Himself-393351311.html">According to NBC</a>, four people who died close to election day since 1962 have been elected to the House of Representatives. </p>

<p>Nojay reportedly shot himself in the head on the same day he was slotted to appear in U.S. District Court to face fraud charges&#x2014;that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2016/09/09/bill-nojay-dies-assemblyman-radio-show-host/90119840/">he&apos;d allegedly embezzled</a> $1.8 million from a trust fund he managed as an attorney. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115333/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/nyregion/bill-nojay-rochester-assemblyman-dies.html">The NY Times reports</a> that the feds were also investigating fraud allegations related to the politician&apos;s Cambodia-based &quot;agricultural marketing business.&quot; </p>
