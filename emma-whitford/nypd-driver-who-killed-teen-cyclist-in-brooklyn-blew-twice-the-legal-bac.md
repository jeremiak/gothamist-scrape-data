<p>The driver who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110627/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/18/teen_cyclist_fatally_struck_by_alle.php">struck and killed a teenage cyclist</a> in Brooklyn on Sunday evening had a blood alcohol level of 0.163 at the time of his arrest, an NYPD source confirmed Monday. The legal limit for operating a vehicle is less than half that&#x2014;0.08. </p>

<p>The NYPD&apos;s preliminary investigation also revealed that 24-year-old Thomas Groarke, who has since been charged with vehicular manslaughter, driving while intoxicated, and driving while ability impaired, was speeding at the time of the crash. </p>

<p>Sean Ryan, 17, graduated this spring from Xaverian High School, a private Catholic high school in Bay Ridge. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110627/https://www.gofundme.com/2f3qe2d4">A GoFundMe page started in Ryan&apos;s memory</a> details that the teen was planning to attend Iona College in New Rochelle this fall. His family has lived in Gerritsen Beach, where Ryan was fatally struck, since 2007. </p>

<p>An anonymous friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110627/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/driver-boozed-killed-cyclist-brooklyn-article-1.2716406">told the News</a> that Ryan aspired to be a journalist, and kept his own sports blog writing about professional basketball, football and hockey.</p>

<p>Police said that Ryan was riding his bicycle northbound down the middle of Gerritsen Avenue near the corner of Gotham Avenue shortly after 8:45 p.m. on Sunday&#x2014;about half a mile from his home&#x2014;at the time of the crash. Groarke was headed south in a white Honda Accord and drove onto the painted median, striking Ryan. According to a criminal complaint acquired by the News, Groarke crossed onto the median while attempting to pass another car in the southbound lane. The crash left Ryan&apos;s bicycle in two pieces on the roadway. </p>

<p>The tabloid reports that Groarke was arraigned Monday and released on $50,000 bail. </p>

<p>At least 13 cyclists have been killed on NYC streets in 2016 to date. By comparison, five cyclists had been killed this time last year&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110627/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/06/cyclist_deaths_nypd.php">a year-to-year increase of about 140%</a>. </p>

<p>Two other pedestrians were killed by allegedly drunk drivers this week. Zaalika Rasool was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110627/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/19/queens_hit_and_run_2.php">killed by a speeding, allegedly drunk driver in Queens</a> on Sunday (the driver fled and has yet to be apprehended, while Rasool&apos;s 9-year-old daughter clings to life), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110627/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/18/mit_student_killed_by_cop.php">21-year-old Andrew Esquivel was fatally struck</a> on a Williamsburg sidewalk by Nicholas Batka, 28, an off-duty police officer. Batka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110627/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/17/off-duty_cop_hit_with_manslaughter.php">was charged</a> with manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter, assault, driving while intoxicated, driving while ability impaired and driving on a sidewalk, and has since been released on a $300,000 bail. </p>
