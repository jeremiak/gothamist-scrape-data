<p>Robert DeCarlo, 28, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/nypd_hit-and-run_driver_killed_12-y.php">killed 12-year-old Joie Sellers</a> and severely injured Sellers&apos;s mother and 9-year-old sister in a hit-and-run crash in Flatlands in July 2014 was sentenced today in Brooklyn court, and will serve between five and fifteen years in prison. </p>

<p>DeCarlo pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault last month. He&apos;s also been sentenced to 3.5 years, to run concurrently with the crash sentence, for his involvement in a robbery in 2014. </p>

<p>&quot;Robert DeCarlo was sentenced to the maximum allowed by law on this case, but this will never compensate for the loss of Joie Sellers, a beautiful and vibrant young girl who was robbed of her life because of the defendant&#x2019;s reckless and irresponsible actions,&quot; said Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson in a statement. </p>

<p>According to reporters at the sentencing, DeCarlo broke down in tears Monday when Joie&apos;s grandmother addressed him directly. </p>

<p>DeCarlo was speeding in a stolen minivan when he struck the Sellers family on July 2nd, 2014. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/nypd_hit-and-run_driver_killed_12-y.php">According to the NYPD at the time</a>, the mother and two daughters were waiting at a bus stop at Flatlands Avenue and East 46th Street just before 4:45 p.m. when DeCarlo careened into them. The van jumped the curb, striking the mother and her daughters. Witnesses later said that DeCarlo was &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/stolen-minivan-hits-child-pedestrians-killing-article-1.1852695">going 120 miles per hour</a>,&quot; and that he fled the scene on foot. According to the DA&apos;s office, an investigation revealed that DeCarlo was speeding &quot;in excess&quot; of 50 miles per hour, in a 30 mph zone. </p>

<p>Joie succumbed to her injuries at Kings County Hospital. He mother Marsha Landias, 38 at the time of the crash, sustained pelvic fractures. Her sister Charli sustained head trauma, was in a coma for several weeks, and is now blind and partially paralyzed. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a tragic, tragic situation. The family is torn apart,&quot; Council member Jumaane Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/12-year-old-joie-sellers-victim-brooklyn-crash-mourned-wake-article-1.1880879">told the News</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/26/battered_brooklyn_family_mourns_12-.php">at Joie&apos;s funeral</a>. &quot;The mom had to be wheeled in here tonight. The daughter is paralyzed and blind. It&apos;s complete devastation.&quot;</p>

<p>During a court appearance shortly after the crash, DeCarlo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/suspect-wreck-killed-joie-sellers-12-expresses-sorrow-article-1.1855966">said he believed he deserved prison time</a>. &quot;I took a life. I have to pay for that. I have to pay for a life,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to do life. But a good amount of years ... 15 years, maybe.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/deadly_drivers_nyc.php">report issued in December</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/https://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a> found that out of 4,000 hit-and-run crashes in 2015 that resulted in injury or death, only 1% of the drivers were charged with a crime. Advocates have blamed the borough District Attorneys for this statistic, although Thompson has not historically been ranked as the worst offender (that honor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/https://twitter.com/ChristRobbins/status/674344583581597696">goes to Staten Island DA Daniel Master Jr.</a>). </p>

<p>Last December, Thompson charged a driver who jumped the curb in Fort Greene and killed pedestrian Victoria Nicodemus with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/fort_greene_nicodemus.php">two misdemeanors</a>; a truck driver who struck and killed cyclist James Gregg in Park Slope last month was issued five summonses, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/22/park_slope_truck_cyclist.php">no criminality was suspected</a> in that crash. </p>

<p>On Monday Thompson stated, &quot;We will continue to hold drivers accountable for the choices they make behind the wheel.&quot; </p>

<p>The SUV driver who hit and killed Upper West Side artist and activist Jean Chambers in July 2014 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/uws_driver_mercado_prison.php">was sentenced</a> in January to 1 to 3 years in prison. In Feburary, the teenaged driver who struck and killed 4-year-old Ariel Russo in 2013 was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002172606/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/unlicensed_teen_driver_who_killed_4_3.php">sentenced</a> to up to nine years in prison.</p>
