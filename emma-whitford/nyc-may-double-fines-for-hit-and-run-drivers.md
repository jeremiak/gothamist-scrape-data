<p>New York City will likely increase the maximum civil penalty for drivers who flee the scene of a car crash from $10,000 to $20,000 for crashes that result in death, following a unanimous City Council Transportation Committee vote on Tuesday morning. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2103613&amp;GUID=80B60905-B7DD-4B9F-906C-0EE05563E4E2&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">new legislation</a>, maximum fines for hit-and-runs would exceed DWI fines, which max out at $10,000. </p>

<p>The vote will go before the entire city council later this week. Pending council approval, the legislation will go before the Mayor. </p>

<p>&quot;Hit-and-run crashes are the most egregious, because drivers literally leave victims to die,&quot; said Committee Chair Ydanis Rodriguez before casting his vote in favor. &quot;Hit-and-run is an epidemic that we are committed to eradicate.&quot; </p>

<p>The goal is to &quot;close the drunken drivers loophole, which makes it more efficient for drunk drivers to leave the site of a crash,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>Today&apos;s vote is a step towards strengthening the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/23/hit_run_nyc_law.php">Justice For Hit and Run Victims Act</a>, passed in September 2014 as a supplement to Mayor Bill de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://gothamist.com/tags/visionzero">Vision Zero initiative</a>. In the intervening year, hit-and-run crashes have held steady. According to the City, 38,000 hit-and-runs have been documented this year to date, resulting in 4,000 injuries and 34,000 cases of property damage.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday night, 17-year-old Ovidio Jaramillo was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/teen_crossing_the_street_killed_in.php">struck and killed</a> by a hit-and-run driver in the crosswalk at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and Junction Boulevard in Queens. The driver, behind the wheel of a black Toyota Camry, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/13/cops_seeks_person_of_interest_in_hi.php">still at large</a>. </p>

<p>And on Sunday, an unlicensed driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/14/unlicensed_driver_queens.php">struck 21-year-old Urabia Nelson</a> in a Far Rockaway intersection as she pushed a 9-year-old child to safety on the sidewalk. She remains in critical condition. </p>

<p>&quot;My vote is dedicated to Miss Nelson, who sacrificed her body to a child she was with,&quot; said Councilmember Donovan Richards, who represents her district. &quot;May the gentleman who did this be hit with the stiffest fine and be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.&quot; </p>

<p>To be sure, civil penalties are only impactful to the extent that they are applied. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/deadly_drivers_nyc.php">According to a report</a> issued last week by Transportation Alternatives, fewer than 1% of the drivers involved in roughly 4,000 hit-and-run crashes this year that resulted in injury or death were charged with a crime.</p>

<p>An accompanying piece of legislation, also unanimously approved by the committee, would attempt to monitor this discrepancy: the police department would be required to issue reports four times a year on the number of violations issued for crashes that result in serious injuries, and annually on the number of hit-and-run complaints received, compared to the number of arrests made.  </p>

<p>Reached by phone this afternoon, Transportation Alternatives Director Paul Steely White said that the new fines would be a &quot;welcome first step.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a big problem that the penalty for a hit-and-run is less than the penalty for drunk driving,&quot; he added. &quot;It creates a perverse incentive to flee the scene. Now we really need Albany to create a uniform sanction that will also increase jail time for hit-and-run drivers, and send a clear message that hit-and-run is an unconscionable act.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029212700/http://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a> is currently pushing for legislation, supported by the NY State DAs Association, that would elevate leaving the scene of a fatal crash to a C felony, and leaving the scene of a crash causing serious injury to a D felony. </p>

<p>Under current law, it is a C felony to kill someone while driving under the influence, but only a D felony to leave the scene of a fatal crash.</p>
