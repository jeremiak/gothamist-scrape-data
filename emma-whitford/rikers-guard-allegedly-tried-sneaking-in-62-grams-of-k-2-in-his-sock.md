<p>Department of Investigation officials searched Officer Mohammed Sufian, 25, and found that he had packed 61.6 grams of the inexpensive and hallucinatory potpourri into his socks before heading into work. </p>

<p>According to the Bronx DA&apos;s office, Officer Sufian was stopped during the 3:00 p.m. shift change at the Anna M. Kross Center on Wednesday, by a DOI chocolate Labrador Retriever named Gunner (yes, Gunner). Prosecutors alleged that Sufian had been paid $500 the night before his arrest, and was expecting a second payout on delivery. The DOI proceeded to search Sufian&apos;s home, and found four packages of K2 packed in black electrical tape weighing 162 grams, plus 32 grams of tobacco&#x2014;all allegedly intended for Rikers. </p>

<p>Sufian had been employed by the DOC since October 2014 at the time of his arrest, with an annual salary of $39,755. He has been suspended from his post and charged with receiving bribery and promoting prison contraband. Combined, his charges bear a maximum sentence of 15 years. </p>

<p>The DOI has arrested 25 DOC staff members since 2014, many on contraband charges. </p>

<p>K2 was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611040702/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/k2_synthetic_marijuana_illegal.php">officially criminalized</a> in NYC last October, following months of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611040702/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/24/k2_10_million_nyc.php">intensifying</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611040702/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/13/k2_crackdown_ny.php">crackdowns</a> on the cheap over-the-counter drug. Selling or manufacturing K2 was previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611040702/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/09/16/synthetic-marijuana-arrests/">only considered a health code violation</a>, carrying a $250 fine. Now, offenders are punishable by up to $5,000 in fines and a year in prison. </p>

<p>Last summer, five psychiatric patients on Wards Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611040702/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/24/five_psychiatric_patients_hospitali.php">were hospitalized</a> after smoking the stuff, which has been known to cause seizures. <br>
