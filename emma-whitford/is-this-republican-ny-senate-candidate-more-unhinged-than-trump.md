<p>Girodes sent the email in question to WNBC reporter Sarah Garza on September 17th, in response to a question about a woman who said Girodes owed her $7,750 in an apartment rental dispute (WNBC then shared the e-mail with Gothamist in its entirety). The relevant bit is included as a PS: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I&apos;m hosting an event in Harlem which will be in front of the state building in a few weeks,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We will do rate (sic.) Kool Aid, KFC and watermelons to the public on 125th street in Harlem. Please join us to help the community.&quot; </blockquote>

<p>Girodes denied that he ever wrote about the event. &quot;I am saying I didn&apos;t write that. I can only speculate, but if you want to quote me, I didn&apos;t write that,&quot; he told Gothamist on Wednesday. </p>

<p>He then went on to accuse WNBC investigative reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104703/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/on-air/as-seen-on/Sarah-Wallace-I-Team-NBC-4-New-York-325933021.html">Sarah Wallace</a> of stalking him, describing her text message requests for comment as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to lure him romantically&#x2014;comments he described as jokes. </p>

<p>&quot;I did not write those words, and if Sarah Wallace is interested in dating me you can tell her I&apos;m in love with my girlfriend,&quot; Girodes told Gothamist on Wednesday. </p>

<p>Girodes also confirmed that he responded to one text from Wallace with a shirtless picture of himself&#x2014;a photo message that features in WNBC&apos;s coverage. &quot;That is something I sent to Sarah Wallace because I got so angry at this lady,&quot; he said. &quot;She keeps texting me and texting me. I thought she had a crush. I&apos;m a very funny guy. That&apos;s my sarcasm.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sarah Wallace has been on me like white on rice,&quot; he continued. &quot;Like a moth to the flame. She texts me at 2 in the morning, 3 in the morning. In the beginning I thought she was someone who had a crush on me and I asked her to stop texting me.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101216_Wallace1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104703im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/101216_Wallace1.jpg" width="640" height="345"> <br> <i> A screenshot of Wallace during her WNBC segment on Girodes. </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Wallace conducted a woman-on-the-street segment about Girodes&apos;s KFC e-mail, pounding the pavement with a poster board cutout: Girodes&apos;s face on one side, his quote on the other. Many people didn&apos;t seem to know who Girodes was, but their reaction was, as NBC put it, &quot;swift and fierce.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re gonna donate, like, various foots in his ass if he try that,&quot; one man said. </p>

<center><script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104703js_/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/portableplayer/?cmsID=396722611&amp;videoID=NIVYdwz_goTp&amp;origin=nbcnewyork.com&amp;sec=news&amp;subsec=local&amp;width=600&amp;height=360"></script></center>

<p>But Girodes said Wednesday that the comments were defensible, even as he denied having made them. &quot;I should say for the record that I grew up in Harlem, I&apos;m Cuban and African-American. For the record we did grow up eating a lot of watermelon,&quot; he said, adding: </p>

<blockquote>Fried chicken not so much. We ate something called platanos and tostones and white rice and beans, but we did have a lot of Kool Aid growing up. I grew up on 112th and Madison Avenue. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything wrong with Kool Aid or KFC or watermelons. I still eat a lot of them today. </blockquote>

<p>In response to the backlash from Harlem residents, Girodes said, &quot;There&apos;s not anything wrong with giving food out to people who need it.&quot; Though, &quot;I would probably give out asparagus and tomatoes now. I would give watermelon out, too. Because watermelon is great. There&apos;s nothing wrong with watermelon.&quot; </p>

<p>Girodes, who is challenging incumbent Democrat Bill Perkins in a majority-Democrat district, does not have the backing of the Manhattan Republican Party, nor the New York GOP. </p>

<p>&quot;The statements made by Jon Girodes are unacceptable and reprehensible. He should apologize immediately and withdraw from the race,&quot; said Republican County Chair Adele Malpass in a statement, referring to the KFC e-mail.  </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101216_Wallace4.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104703im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/101216_Wallace4.jpg" width="640" height="361"> <br> <i> The text message that Girodes sent to Wallace, of himself, shirtless (screenshot via WNBC). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Girodes countered that he&apos;s been unfairly targeted by his own party. &quot;I am the lowest man on the totem pole,&quot; he said. &quot;Somewhere along the line people were calling me Trump Jr., and I think they are trying to sabotage the GOP right now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m a New Yorker,&quot; he added. &quot;It takes a lot to throw me off. I&apos;m like Jerry Seinfeld mixed with Kramer and a little bit of Costanza. It takes a lot more than NBC and Sarah Wallace and the internet to scare me away. If I was so weak I wouldn&apos;t be running for anything.&quot;</p>

<p>But in a phone interview today, Girodes kept returning to Wallace (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104703/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/Sarah-Wallace-NBC-4-New-York-I-Team-Investigative-Journalist-321386511.html">has won</a> multiple Emmys and Peabody Awards for her reporting). &quot;I&apos;m saying I would like to know if Sarah Wallace is doing okay mentally,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;The last time I had a stalker like that I had to write it up with the police department.&quot; </p>

<p>Wallace declined to comment on Girodes&apos;s statements. </p>

<p>Girodes also denied reports that he is planning to drop out of the race, and said that his website, which came down during Wallace&apos;s reporting, will be back up tonight. &quot;The biggest problem in my district is affordable housing, safety, and believe it or not, parking tickets,&quot; he said. &quot;Why are we wasting valuable air time talking about watermelon?&quot;  </p>

<p>Yesterday, Girodes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104703/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1181650055259758&amp;set=a.546070852151018.1073741825.100002443235371&amp;type=3&amp;theater">changed his Facebook profile picture</a> to a sad-puppy meme with the text: &quot;It wasn&apos;t me, I promise.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He is not known in the district,&quot; said Harlem Community Board 10 Chair Brian Benjamin. &quot;Harlem residents have way more important issues to deal with like affordable housing, jobs and education. This is a desperate candidate doing anything he can to get publicity. He has been watching Trump and he thinks any press is good press.&quot; </p>
