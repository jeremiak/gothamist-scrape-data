<p>Veteran NYPD officer Masood Syed will return to work with his beard, less than two weeks after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144857/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/nypd_beard_lawsuit.php">filing a federal class-action lawsuit</a> alleging that the NYPD&apos;s facial hair policy&#x2014;an amalgamation of guidebook rules and unwritten accommodations&#x2014;violates his constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Syed said that he was suspended without pay last month after he refused to shave his beard to one millimeter&#x2014;even though he&apos;s maintained a longer beard for &quot;nearly all&quot; of his decade on the force. A practicing Muslim from Queens assigned to a unit that handles internal disciplinary proceedings, Syed has said that he wears the beard in accordance with his faith. At an emergency hearing in Manhattan federal court in late June, a judge ordered the NYPD to keep paying Syed until his next court date.</p>

<p>&quot;As of last night he&apos;s been fully reinstated,&quot; said Syed&apos;s lawyer Luna Droubi on Friday. &quot;Before he was on paid leave, so now he&apos;s been completely fully reinstated to his job, with his beard, and the NYPD has agreed to review its policy. It&apos;s exactly what we were seeking.&quot; </p>

<p>The department will conduct a 120-day internal review of its no-beard rule, and possibly adjust how it assesses and disciplines beard wearers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144857/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/nyregion/new-york-police-department-to-review-no-beard-policy.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion">according to the New York Times</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m excited to be back at work,&quot; Syed said in a statement. &quot;I am hopeful that the department&#x2019;s new policy will in fact allow myself and other officers to wear our beards at a reasonable length without the fear of retaliation or hostility.&quot;</p>

<p>Former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144857/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/15/nypd_requires_c.php">revised the department&apos;s patrol guide</a> in 2008 to prohibit facial hair, making exceptions for undercover officers and, on a case-by-case basis, cops seeking religious or medical accommodation. Those exempt from the no-beard policy are often allowed facial hair up to one millimeter in length, according to the suit. His lawyers equate that length to a day&apos;s stubble. </p>

<p>The NYPD has previously justified the beard rule as a safety measure, saying that facial hair can interfere with the seal on a gas mask. But Droubi counters that her client was certified to wear a gas mask, despite his beard. </p>

<p>&quot;I can&apos;t speak to why they are suddenly making this a big deal,&quot; she told us last week. &quot;But there&apos;s a lot of inherent discrimination that can be masked under words that sound neutral.&quot;</p>

<p>Droubi added on Friday that she hopes the review process will not take place behind closed doors. &quot;We&apos;d much rather the community and religious leaders included in the conversation,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;re bringing this claim for Sikhs and Orthodox Jewish officers as well.&quot; </p>
