<p>In the days since, the alleged attack has sparked debate among the activists, several of whom identify as queer, about when it makes sense to file a complaint with the NYPD. </p>

<p>Michael Basillas, 31, a fashion designer from Harlem, says he left the party around midnight on Saturday with about eight other people, all chanting slogans from various activist movements. &quot;We were chanting in front of the place&#x2014;it was a celebration&#x2014;everything from Black Lives Matter to Queer Liberation,&quot; he recalled. </p>

<p>The group started walking east on Walker Street towards Broadway, intending to get some food, when they say four men on the other side of the street started yelling &apos;Trump&apos; at them. &quot;They started chanting &apos;Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,&apos; so we started chanting, &apos;<em>Ole, ole, ole</em>, screw Trump, screw Trump,&apos;&quot; Basillas said. He described the group of men as racially mixed, and said they seemed to be rallying behind one man in particular&#x2014;white, about 5&apos;11&quot;, with tattoos and a &quot;Blue Lives Matter&quot; band on his wrist. </p>

<p>The man with the &apos;Blue Lives Matter&apos; bracelet allegedly punched a member of the group, Connor Hicks, in the face, according to Hicks and multiple witnesses. &quot;They specifically went after the queer people, and queer people of color,&quot; said Hicks, who is white.</p>

<p>&quot;I tried to take a swing at him and he ended up hitting me,&quot; recalled Colin Ashley, a 36-year-old sociology professor at Hunter College and organizer with People&apos;s Power Assemblies. &quot;I had a hold on him while he continued to punch me in the face. Once we hit the ground he was wailing on me and kept punching me in the face.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It turned into a big brawl,&quot; said Peter Soeller, 24, another member of the group. &quot;Most people were focused on pulling the big white guy off of Colin [Ashley]. I&apos;m a skinny guy, and this guy was a hulk. I tried really hard to pull him off, [and the] guy turns around, calls me a faggot, punches me in the face, knocked my glasses off. My nose was pouring blood.&quot; </p>

<p>Basillas and Patti Cruz, a 26-year-old social worker, said that the commotion drew about 20 partygoers out into the street. As the fight broke up, they allegedly approached police in a patrol car parked near the scene. &quot;We tried to talk to them [the police], and they told us, &apos;Step onto the sidewalk.&apos; They didn&apos;t take the information,&quot; Basillas recalled. </p>

<p>&quot;My friend and I told the officer that our queer, gay friends were attacked by these white supremacists, and he just said, &apos;We&apos;ll patrol the area, why don&apos;t you just go back to where you were,&apos;&quot; Cruz said. </p>

<p>Two &quot;activist medics&quot; attending the party came to the group&apos;s aide, according to Cruz. Four people were treated for injuries inside the gallery space. Ashley sustained facial swelling and bruising, he said. Hicks said he sustained a swollen jaw, and two welts on his forehead. </p>

<p>The NYPD did not have any record of the incident on Wednesday morning, and declined to comment on whether police had been on the scene that night. &quot;We looked into that incident, we checked 911, we checked the database for any complaints of an assault, and there has been nothing of the sort,&quot; a spokesman said. </p>

<p>The alleged victims said that they were not able to capture video or photos of their attackers.</p>

<p>Hicks and Soeller said that they deliberated with the other victims for several days about whether to file a complaint with the police. &quot;Communities that are affected by police violence have a hard time trusting the police when things like this happen,&quot; Hicks said. The alleged indifference from officers on the scene deepened their reservations. </p>

<p>&quot;It was a very difficult conversation in the last 24 hours to do something that doesn&apos;t align with their activism,&quot; Basillas added. By Tuesday, the group had decided that &quot;it would be a challenge for the NYPD to do their job correctly without the information.&quot; </p>

<p>But Hicks said that he and Soeller went to the First Precinct around 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday and began the complaint filing process, only to back out. &quot;We were open and honest about being activists and the cop was listening, but he really didn&apos;t seem that interested,&quot; Hicks alleged. He added that he&apos;s now hoping to acquire surveillance footage from nearby buildings without NYPD assistance. </p>

<p>Anti-Defamation League Policy Director Etzion Neuer told Gothamist that the scenario was a familiar one, citing &quot;victims&apos; reluctance to deal with the police based on a history of animosity.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Writ large, the incident highlights that the ability of law enforcement to respond to hate crimes depends on a mutual trust between the law enforcement and the community they serve,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>The alleged assault comes in the midst of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161223172256/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/15/hate_crimes_trumps_amerikkka.php">uptick in hate incident reports</a>. </p>

<p>Basillas said his group wanted to publicize the story to warn other potential victims. &quot;We want people to understand that they, too, could be susceptible to this violence,&quot; he said. &quot;At this point the conversation in the activist scene is prioritizing self-defense.&quot; </p>

<p>Ashley added that he was hesitant to blame President-elect Trump, whose campaign featured racist, sexist and homophobic rhetoric, as well as promises to ban and deport minority groups.  </p>

<p>&quot;I think the election showed many of us how big these problems still are&#x2014;racism, sexism, homophobia,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;But the starting point isn&apos;t the election of Donald Trump.&quot; </p>
