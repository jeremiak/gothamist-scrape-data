<p>EMTs responded to the corner of East 8th and University Place shortly after 10:50 this morning. There, they discovered a woman pinned between the taxi and a stucco wall parallel to University Place. The victim&apos;s name has not yet been released. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132033/https://twitter.com/DengAudrey/status/718104416981749761">NYU&apos;s Washington Square News reports</a> that the woman was wearing a backpack when she was struck, and was unconscious on the scene, but had &quot;no obvious amputations.&quot; She was transported to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition. </p>

<p>&#x201C;The woman was facing away from the cab, and when it hit her, she went up in the air and the cab basically pinned her against the wall,&#x201D; one witness told the outlet. </p>

<p>The NYPD said that the driver stayed on the scene, and that no charges have been filed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132033/http://www.nyunews.com/2016/04/07/breaking-taxi-hits-woman-in-front-of-weinstein/">Washington Square reports</a> that the driver experienced brake failure, but the NYPD would not confirm this, saying only that the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>A spokesperson could not confirm the age or the gender of the driver. The taxi apparently also struck a clay pot on the sidewalk between East 8th and Washington Mews. </p>

<p><strong>Update 3:24 p.m.</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132033/http://nypost.com/2016/04/07/woman-slammed-by-taxi-near-nyu/">The Post reports</a> that the cabbie made an illegal turn before striking the yet-to-be identified victim. &quot;She looked really bad,&#x201D; one NYU student told the paper. &quot;They had to wash blood off the screen sidewalk. They did work very fast to get her out. I&#x2019;m pretty sure I saw someone die.&quot;</p>

<p>Witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132033/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/woman-injured-stuck-cab-village-article-1.2592069">told the Daily News</a> the cab driver appeared to be speeding. &quot;The cab was going real fast. He loses control and goes the wrong way,&quot; one witness said. Another witness said the driver &quot;didn&#x2019;t [seem] like he was fazed too much&quot; after striking the victim.</p>

<p>She is currently in serious condition at Bellevue Hospital.</p>
