<p>A big chunk of the FDR Drive on the Upper East Side <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025113329/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2016/pr16-053.shtml">will be shut down in both directions</a> off-and-on during overnight hours for the next month.</p>

<p>According to the Department of Transportation, workers are taking over the roadway for two large scale projects&#x2014;the East 91st Street Marine Transfer Station, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025113329/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150806/yorkville/city-adds-second-ramp-marine-transfer-station-plan-adding-30m-cost">will eventually collect waste</a> from four Manhattan districts, and a new two story, three-block-long Rockefeller University building, the steel pieces of which are being dropped into place from massive crane barges on the East River and assembled <em>over</em> the FDR. </p>

<p>The first major drop took place early this morning, of a structural steel piece weighing in at about 1.53 million pounds. Here&apos;s a rendering/clarification of why it&apos;s probably a good idea to clear the lanes: </p>

<p>Traffic expert Sam Schwartz, a.k.a. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025113329/http://gothamist.com/tags/gridlocksam">Gridlock Sam</a>, has been keeping a close eye on both projects, and issued a warning to NYC drivers this week, urging everyone with wheels to avoid First and Second Avenues, 42nd-96th Streets, and York Avenue from 59th-96th Streets during closures. </p>

<p>&quot;The FDR Drive is the only continuous highway through Manhattan,&quot; he stated. &quot;Its closures will be felt regionally, so try to stay on the Brooklyn-Queens side as long as possible or the Henry Hudson/West Side Highway combo.&quot; </p>

<p>There&apos;s plenty more full-closure action scheduled for this week, in both directions from 61st to 96th Streets. The FDR will be best avoided starting around 10:00 p.m. leading up to these scheduled work hours: </p>

<blockquote>Thursday June 16th and Friday June 17th: 12:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.

<p>Saturday, June 18th: 1 a.m. to 5:30 a.m.<br>
Sunday, June 19th: 2 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>And here are the lovely detours: </p>

<blockquote>Southbound traffic will exit at 96th Street, and use Second Avenue to 42nd Street to reenter the FDR drive.

<p>During the closures the southbound entrance ramps at Third Avenue Bridge, RFK Bridge, 125th Street, 116th Street, 92nd Street, 79th Street and 73rd Street will be closed.</p>

<p>Northbound traffic will exit at 61st Street, be directed to First Avenue, and follow detour signs to 96th Street to re-enter the FDR drive.</p>

<p>During the closures the northbound entrance ramps at 34th, 42nd, and 62nd Streets will be closed.</p>

<p>The southbound FDR Drive 34th Street exit will be closed.</p>

<p>Before the closures go in one to two lanes will be closed between 11 p.m. and midnight.</p>

<p>All lanes will reopen by 5:30 a.m. on weekdays, 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, and 11:00 a.m. on Sunday.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Similar goodies are in store through July 19th, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025113329/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2016/pr16-053.shtml">weekly closure updates</a> expected from the DOT. Unless, the city warns, inclement weather slows everything down. </p>
