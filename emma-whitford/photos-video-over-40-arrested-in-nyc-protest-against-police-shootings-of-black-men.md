					<p>Hundreds of protesters marched through Manhattan Thursday night to decry police brutality in the wake of three fatal shootings of black men by law enforcement in less than a week. </p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-shooting.html">killed Alton Sterling</a>, 37, outside of a Baton Rouge, Louisiana convenience store early Tuesday morning. A Minneapolis cop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36732908">killed Philando Castile</a>, 32, during a traffic stop Wednesday night, and an off-duty NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/07/delrawn_small_vigil.php">fatally shot Delrawn Small</a>, 37, during a road rage incident in East New York early Monday.  </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m out here because I&apos;m scared for myself, I&apos;m scared for every member of my family, and I&apos;m overwhelmed with sadness, and it was a hard day today to even get out of the house,&quot; said Monica Afessi, marching up 9th Avenue towards Times Square. &quot;We&apos;ve seen this type of thing happen, and we&apos;ve seen that there&apos;s no recourse for the victims and their families.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It really enraged me that there were such big shootings back to back,&quot; added 33-year-old Axel Alvin. &quot;It enrages me that police are feeling more empowered with every non-indictment.&quot; </p>

<p>The Justice Department this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-shooting.html">launched</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/07/07/justice-dept-monitoring-bca-investigation-of-castile-shooting/">investigations</a> into the killings of both Castile and Sterling. &quot;I used to get excited when the Justice Department would come in and take over a case, but now I no longer have any faith in them,&quot; Alvin added. </p>

<p>Shortly after gathering in Union Square at 5:00 p.m., marchers stopped traffic on Fifth Avenue between 14th and 33rd Streets, peacefully walking through lanes of taxis, trucks, and double-decker tour buses without police intervention. Just before 8:00 p.m., hundreds blocked car and pedestrian traffic in Times Square at 42nd Street and 7th Avenue, staging a sit-in before NYPD officers began making arrests. </p>

<p>Close to midnight&#x2014;six hours into the action, and as news trickled in that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-alton-sterling-protests/index.html">five police officers had been fatally shot</a> at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas&#x2014;hundreds of New Yorkers were still in the streets, with many marching in East Harlem. According to the NYPD, about 40 arrests were made, mostly for disorderly conduct. More than 1,000 demonstrators were involved at the protest&apos;s peak.</p>

<p>&quot;What affects someone anywhere in the U.S. affects us all,&quot; said Terryll Dozier, 31, of Harlem. &quot;From Ferguson to Baltimore to New York. This is an epidemic that spans geography.&quot; </p>

<p>Nora Offan, 26, of Williamsburg, held a sign that read, &quot;Enough, for fuck&apos;s sake.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The last protest I was at I had a sign that said &apos;Enough Already,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;And then I was at a loss because here we are again.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="070816_ProtestBLM.JPG" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/070816_ProtestBLM.JPG" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Protesters fill Times Square ahead of an 8:00 p.m. sit-in (via Tipster). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>In Times Square around 8:20 p.m., photographer Scott Heins stood among the first sizable group of protesters to be arrested. Police officers with zip ties snaked into the middle of the intersection and began making arrests, leading protesters to a pair of repurposed MTA buses on the west side of the intersection. Marchers recording on their phones chanted, &quot;You serve us!&quot; and &quot;The whole world is watching!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Things in Times Square went from peaceful and stationary to chaotic and violent,&quot; Heins said. &quot;Multiple times I watched as NYPD officers lunged at and aggressively arrested demonstrators who were standing back at a distance, not antagonizing and doing exactly what everyone else was doing.&quot; </p>

<p>Ariel Knight, 27, stood on top of a nearby concrete barrier to see over the crowd. &quot;They arrested probably a dozen people,&quot; she told us afterwards. &quot;It looks like they were singling out people and sort of tackling them to the ground, and using that [tactic] to advance their line of cops forward.&quot; </p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes, most of the intersection was clear. </p>

<p>Protester Theo McCann remarked on the relative orderliness of the scene in Times Square, compared to the violent interactions that prompted last night&apos;s action. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re on the full stage right now, and emotions are really high. But now cops know how to deescalate correctly,&quot; he said. &quot;When there&apos;s an unarmed black man it&apos;s like, &apos;Oh, I&apos;m not sure, let me just take a chance with that [with a gun].&apos; But when there&apos;s an even playing field and full accountability, it&apos;s not the same.&quot; </p>

<p>Protesters said on Thursday that video evidence is a powerful tool in documenting police brutality&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://theadvocate.com/news/16326273-124/latest-second-video-emerges-of-alton-sterling-fatal-shooting-by-baton-rouge-police">two cellphone videos</a> of Sterling&apos;s death emerged this week, and Castile&apos;s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-facebook-police-shooting-minnesota.html">captured his death on Facebook Live</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;The gore and the lack of humanity in those videos are bringing people out,&quot; said 28-year-old Nolan Hack, an activist from Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Others said they worried the videos were desensitizing Americans to the gore. </p>

<p>&quot;I feel like shutting off social media. It&apos;s overwhelming and distressing,&quot; said Amina Hassen, 28, of Bed Stuy. &quot;It feels like we&apos;re stuck and there&apos;s nothing changing.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;We have seen videos back to back to back of black men, black women being killed, and it&apos;s starting to desensitize the way we see black men and black women,&quot; added 21-year-old Margot Terry. &quot;The fact that [Sterling&apos;s] body was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/750876217360936960">on the front page of the Daily News</a>&#x2014;people walked by without paying attention, and that was a dead human life lost to the hands of somebody who&apos;s supposed to be protecting human life.&quot; </p>

<p>Terry said that marching in the streets, though it assuages pain, increasingly doesn&apos;t feel like a strong enough response to police brutality. &quot;I think there should be boycotts, because the reason black people are so prominent in this country is because of our dollar,&quot; she said. &quot;If we take our dollar away from them they will start paying attention, and I think that&apos;s where it begins.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We gotta start exercising our economic muscle,&quot; echoed Raymond Smith, 52, a retired NYPD officer from the Bronx. &quot;Because establishment don&apos;t understand nothing but money. And when the money stops, they&apos;ll start listening.&quot; </p>

<p>Watching the busloads of arrested protesters rolling through Times Square, 30-year-old Samantha Lenox of Harlem shook her head. </p>

<p>&quot;Midtown,&quot; she said. &quot;They [the cops] are ready for us. They know what we&apos;re going to do. It&apos;s the same-old.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Let&apos;s go to Brooklyn. Let&apos;s go to Flatbush Avenue, let&apos;s go to Nostrand Avenue, Fordham Road in the Bronx, Gunhill Road in the Bronx, 125th Street in Harlem, 145th Street,&quot; she added. &quot;The problem is there&apos;s not enough of us who believe this is doing anything, and in all honesty what can you say? Because <em>is</em> it doing anything? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/PeterLiang">Akai Gurley&apos;s murderer</a> is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132430/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/nypd_cop_sentencing_gurley.php">home doing house arrest</a> and 500 hours of community service.&quot; </p>

<p>Hack, the protester from Los Angeles, agreed. &quot;It keeps going, people are still getting killed,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x2019;s going to take a bigger type of revolution.&quot; </p>
