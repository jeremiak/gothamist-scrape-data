<p>While New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/14/l_no.php">brace themselves</a> for forthcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/l_train_tunnel_closure_years.php">Hurricane Sandy repairs</a> on the L train tunnel, Lower Manhattan is expected to receive an additional $176 million in federal funding for a large-scale flood protection system that will eventually wrap from Montgomery Street on the Lower East Side, around the tip of the borough, and up through Battery Park City.</p>

<p>The details of the fortification plan have yet to be hashed out, but &quot;deployable&quot; flood walls&#x2014;walls that rise into place along the shoreline in anticipation of storm swells&#x2014;are under consideration, as are grassy berms that could double as new parkland on the Lower East Side waterfront. </p>

<p>The boost in funding comes more than three years after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/29/photos_remembering_hurricane_sandys.php#photo-1">Hurricane Sandy</a> ripped through NYC, doing the most damage across lower Manhattan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/dispatch_from_staten_island.php#photo-1">Staten Island</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/08/photos_hurricane_sandys_wrath_on_th.php#photo-1">the Rockaway Peninsula</a>. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/17/climate_change_nyc.php">study</a> released last winter by the NYC Panel on Climate Change predicted that sea levels could rise between 11 inches and 21 inches by the 2050s, and a whopping 22-50 inches by 2100. </p>

<p>This month&apos;s cash injection is part of a national Department of Housing and Urban Development contest called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-dr/resilient-recovery/">National Disaster Resilience Competition</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/nyregion/new-york-city-to-get-176-million-from-us-for-storm-protections.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, HUD identified 40 finalists last June&#x2014;including NYC, New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut&#x2014;to receive part of a $1 billion prize pool to clean up natural disaster sites and take preventative measures against future storms. </p>

<p>Federal officials told the paper that prizes will be officially announced later this month. Senator Chuck Schumer apparently made a big push for NYC to get the bulk of this relief funding, lobbying housing secretary Julian Castro at a downtown diner last week. </p>

<p>HUD could not immediately be reached for confirmation. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033115/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/28/nyc_flood_protection.php">announced $100 million</a> in downtown flood protections last August, hoping the additional funding would tip the scales on NYC&apos;s chances in the HUD competition. The city&apos;s original ask was $500 million. </p>
