<p>The NYPD has released surveillance footage of a man who they believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016154455/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/08/subway_bias_attack_stab.php">hurled anti-gay slurs at another man on the 1 train</a> in Manhattan over the weekend. The suspect, who remains at large, allegedly called the man a &quot;faggot,&quot; punched him in the face and stabbed him multiple times with a sharp object. </p>

<p>Police are investigating the assault as a possible hate crime. </p>

<p>The victim was riding a northbound 1 train with his partner and sister around 7:10 p.m. on Saturday when he and another man got into a &quot;verbal dispute,&quot; according to the NYPD. The victim, whose name has not been released, later told police that the assailant threatened him, saying, &quot;Watch what happens to you at the next stop.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the NYPD&apos;s latest information, the perpetrator exited the train at the Cathedral Parkway 110th Street station in Morningside Heights, then stepped back on and punched the victim in the face.
