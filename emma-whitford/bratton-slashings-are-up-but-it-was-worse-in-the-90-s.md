<p>The first question posed to NYPD Comissioner Bill Bratton at a Public Safety budget hearing on Monday was about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/tags/slashing">slashings</a>. &quot;We saw the first incidents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/d_train_slashing_suspect.php">on the subway system</a>,&quot; said Committee Chair Vanessa Gibson. &quot;Now there have been a number of disputes between individuals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/07/queens_violent_crime_astoria.php">on the streets</a>. Is there anything reflected in this budget for the slashings?&quot; </p>

<p>Commissioner Bratton, who last month said that an uptick in slashing incidents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/03/reportage_square.php">does not indicate a trend</a>, compared his department&apos;s plan of action to the NYPD&apos;s response to shootings in the mid-1990s. </p>

<p>&quot;The [original] purpose of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/tags/Compstat">Compstat</a> was to find out what was driving crime, and at the time it was shootings,&quot; he said. &quot;We focused on shootings, and since 1994 we&apos;ve been tracking them as a distinct category. Similarly, in 2016, we&apos;ll be doing the same for slashings.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, as of this morning, murders are down 20% over last year, and shootings are down 13%, even as slashings are up 20%. This year to date, there have been 153 slashing incidents, a category that includes stabbings and cuttings as well. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m very comfortable that as we go forward we will be able to start turning those numbers around,&quot; Bratton said. The Commissioner referred to his deployment of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/nypd_subway_patrols.php">additional transit officers</a> to the subway as evidence, as well as last week&apos;s announcement of an NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/homeless_shelter_security.php">task force</a> to reassess security in City shelters. He also alluded to an announcement regarding slashings to be made Tuesday, suggesting that public housing developments, parks, and schools will be areas of focus moving forward. </p>

<p>In the last week, a man attacked three restaurant patrons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/21/queens_machete_attack.php">with a machete</a> in Queens, a bicyclist was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/19/bicyclist_stabbed_slashed_near_penn.php">slashed near Penn Station</a>, and five people were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/5_people_stabbed_slashed_during_fig.php">slashed and stabbed</a> during a fight at an after-hours nightclub. </p>

<p>&quot;Slashing incidents are still much lower than the &apos;90s, but as other crime has gone down there&apos;s been more of a focus on them,&quot; Bratton added. </p>

<p>Bratton also fielded questions about last year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/nyregion/substantiated-complaints-about-police-use-of-chokeholds-increase.html">increase in substantiated chokehold incidents</a> from the Civilian Complaint Review Board. </p>

<p>&quot;In 2015 there were twice as many substantiated,&quot; challenged Queens Councilmember Rory Lancman. &quot;Why has the number gone in the wrong direction?&quot; </p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner Kevin Richardson said that a broader definition of &quot;chokehold&quot; had contributed to the increase. Last year, the CCRB redefined a chokehold as &quot;any contact with the neck.&quot; Richardson added that, thanks to increase in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/08/ccrb_police_video.php">cellphone video evidence</a>, substantiation has increased &quot;across the board.&quot; According to the NYPD, one chokehold has been substantiated in 2016 to date. </p>

<p>Commissioner Bratton was less receptive to the questions posed by East New York Councilmember Inez Barron, who presented a poster showing the front of a T-shirt that she said was worn by a plainclothes NYPD officer in her community. </p>

<p>&quot;It lists different caliber bullets that are all faster than calling 911,&quot; she said. &quot;This is not giving justice to the T-shirt, because it had bright neon colors. If you have a police officer wearing this message I can only think what&apos;s on his mind as he&apos;s going out into our community.&quot; </p>

<p>Barron asked the Commissioner if he was aware of the incident, adding that, &quot;We don&apos;t believe that there is any courtesy, professionalism or trust coming to our communities from the NYPD.&quot; </p>

<p>Asked to respond, Bratton initially refused. &quot;I believe the comments were statements more than questions, and I don&apos;t respond to statements,&quot; he said. Pressed further, he said that he had not heard of the incident. </p>

<p>Barron also referenced the NYPD officer who fatally shot 18-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramarleygraham">Ramarley Graham</a> in his Bronx home in 2012. Officer Richard Haste has been on modified service since the incident, but recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ramarley-graham-nypd-richard-haste_us_567455d4e4b0b958f6567aa0">received a raise</a>. Earlier this month, federal prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/ramarley_graham_feds_nypd.php">declined to press charges</a> against him. </p>

<p>&quot;How many officers are on modified duty, and what the cost is to the community?&quot; Barron asked. Bratton responded that there are 273 officers on modified duty, out of the 35,000 officers who are in uniform.</p>
