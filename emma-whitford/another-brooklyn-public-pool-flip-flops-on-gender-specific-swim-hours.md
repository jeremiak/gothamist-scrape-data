<p>For the second time in less than a month, staff at a public indoor swimming pool in Brooklyn posted signage indicating that gender-specific swimming hours had been suspended, then reinstated those hours following an influx of 311 complaints. </p>

<p>As was the case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026030534/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/27/williamsburg_pool_women_only.php">with the Metropolitan Pool in Williamsburg</a> in May, NYC Parks Department officials said that the signage was posted in error, that they were investigating the circumstances, and that the city had not condoned a policy change. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026030534/https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/recreationcenters/B245">St. John&apos;s Recreation Center</a>, near the corner of Troy Avenue on Prospect Place in Bed-Stuy, is one of two public indoor pools in the city that maintains weekly gender-segregated swimming hours, according to the Parks Department. The pool is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026030534/https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/recreationcenters/B245/schedule#Pool">open only to women</a> on Tuesdays between 7:30 and 9:30 P.M., and only to men on Thursdays, during the same time slot.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Parks Department could not confirm what guidelines, if any, are used to establish gender-specific swim hours at public pools. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="061516_Pools2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026030534im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/061516_Pools2.jpeg" width="320" height="426"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> A sign posted in the men&apos;s locker room as recently as yesterday (via Tipster). </i></div> Confusion came to a head on Tuesday evening, when a few men approached the St. John&apos;s pool during hours traditionally designated for women, having read a sign posted on the men&apos;s locker-room door that read, &quot;As of June 6, 2016 there are no more women or men only swim. Only co-ed swim!&quot; <p></p>

<p>Lifeguards turned the confused group away&#x2014;our tipster was among them&#x2014;saying that they were not allowed to swim because of their gender. The temporary co-ed policy had been suspended over the weekend, the lifeguards said, following an influx of 311 calls decrying the rule change over the past week. </p>

<p>Our calls to the rec center were referred back to the Parks Department press office, which confirmed that numerous 311 calls came in last week in regards to the signage. </p>

<p>&quot;The women&apos;s-only and men&apos;s-only hours at St. John&apos;s Recreation Center remain in effect,&quot; said Parks spokesman Sam Biederman in a statement. </p>

<p>The NYC Commission on Human Rights received a tip last month about the Williamsburg Metropolitan Pool&apos;s women-only swimming hours, which they say may be in violation of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026030534/http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/law/nyc-human-rights.shtml">NYC Human Rights Law</a> prohibiting discrimination based on gender, race or creed. </p>

<p>The policy was retracted, then swiftly reinstated. In the case of the Metropolitan Pool, the vast majority of patrons are Hasidic. To suspend women-only swim, Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind argued, is akin to banning women from the pool altogether. </p>

<p>The justification for men-only swim at St. John&apos;s Recreation Center is less clear. Parks could not confirm if the hours are maintained as a religious courtesy, though a tipster and long-time pool user told us Wednesday that the pool has a sizable Hasidic membership and that the women-only hours, at least, seem to accommodate those swimmers. </p>

<p>While the Metropolitan Pool accommodates women on weekday mornings, when facilities are less crowded, the gender-specific hours at St. John&apos;s fall during peak post-work hours. </p>

<p>&quot;On Tuesdays I can&apos;t swim, which can be frustrating,&quot; said the 30-year-old tipster. &quot;I can&apos;t swim in the morning&#x2014;my job doesn&apos;t accommodate that. At the same time, I can understand accommodating a religious practice.&quot; </p>

<p>Parks confirmed last month that it is already in talks with the CCHR about the legality of the practice. Ultimately, the department is hoping to establish a uniform policy for all city pools, to avoid future confusion. Whether that would entail city-wide gender-specific hours or a city-wide ban was not immediately clear. </p>

<p>Reached for comment, a spokesman for the CCHR said that no complaints had been submitted in regards to the St. John&apos;s Center hours, but that discussions with Parks about the policy are ongoing. </p>
