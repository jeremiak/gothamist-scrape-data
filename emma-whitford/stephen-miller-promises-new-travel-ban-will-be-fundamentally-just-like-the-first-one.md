<p>President Donald Trump revealed earlier this month that his team will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/http://sfist.com/2017/02/16/president_trump_will_issue_a_new_ex_1.php">not bother to keep fighting</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/http://sfist.com/2017/02/09/9th_circuit_decision_trump_washingt.php">February court ruling</a> that suspended his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/lawyers_immigration_jfk.php#photo-1">temporary ban on refugees and travel from seven majority-Muslim countries</a>&#x2014;a move that sent international airports spiraling into chaos and mobilized protesters and lawyers in travelers&apos; defense. Instead, Trump&apos;s team is planning to release a <em>new</em> order. </p>

<p>Travel Ban 2.0 is still under wraps, but White House adviser Stephen Miller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaB537hSmX0">made a Fox News appearance on Tuesday</a> to assure a town hall gathering of Trump voters that the new version will be &quot;fundamentally&quot; the same as the old one, albeit &quot;responsive to the judicial ruling.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Fundamentally, you&apos;re still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country,&quot; Miller said. &quot;But you&apos;re going to be responsive to a lot of very technical issues that were brought up by the court.&quot; </p>

<p>Details, beyond this broad assurance, are thin&#x2014;Miller spent the majority of the segment dismissing the &quot;flawed&quot; judicial order, and maintaining that &quot;nothing was wrong with the first executive order.&quot; </p>

<p>Anchor Martha MacCallum picked gently at this logic, to no avail. &quot;I know you think the order was fine the way it was ordered initially,&quot; she said. &quot;But 48 courts took issue with it, and that&apos;s why it&apos;s halted right now, as a result of that process that happens in this country.&quot; </p>

<p>Miller stuck to his &quot;minor technical differences&quot; refrain. (Fox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/20/revised-travel-ban-targets-same-seven-countries-exempts-green-card-holders.html">has a report</a> on the new ban, citing an anonymous White House official, which outlines a ban targeting the same seven countries, albeit with exceptions for all green card holders and American dual citizens.) </p>

<p>A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf">ruled</a> earlier this month that the President does not have &quot;unreviewable authority&quot; to bar entry from the country&#x2014;an opinion Miller and his crew maintain. </p>

<p>&quot;There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability,&quot; the decision reads, &quot;which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.&quot; </p>

<p>More details are expected this week, which means a draft will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/20/leaked_dhs_memos_call_for.php">probably be leaked any minute now</a>. </p>

<p>In the meantime, New York Immigration Coalition attorney Camille Mackler, a lead organizer of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508072130/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/06/jfk_lawyers_trump_travel_ban.php">#NoBanJFK emergency legal services center</a>, told Gothamist this week that the team is prepared to return to the airport at a moment&apos;s notice. </p>

<p>&quot;We need to figure out&#x2014;and we&apos;re getting there&#x2014;how to pivot and respond very, very fast,&quot; she said. </p>
