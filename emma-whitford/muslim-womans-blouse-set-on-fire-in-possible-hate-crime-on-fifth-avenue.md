<p>A 36-year-old woman was window shopping on Fifth Avenue in Midtown on Saturday night when a man walked up to her and set her blouse on fire with a lighter, according to a complaint filed with the NYPD. The woman was wearing hijab, and the NYPD&apos;s Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident as a possible bias attack. </p>

<p>Police said that the woman was standing outside of the Valentino boutique at 693 Fifth Avenue looking at the front window display when she &quot;felt something warm on her left arm.&quot; She looked down and realized that the left sleeve of her blouse was on fire. A man standing next to her allegedly had a lighter in his hand. The woman didn&apos;t know the man, who proceeded to head east on 54th Street without speaking to her. She managed to put out the flames, and was uninjured. </p>

<p>No arrests have been made as of Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Last week, a Brooklyn woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134947/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/10/woman_allegedly_attacked_tried_to_r.php">was arrested</a> after she allegedly attacked two Muslim women pushing their babies in strollers in Bath Beach. Prosecutors say she attempted to rip off their hijabs and told them, &quot;Get the fuck out of America, bitches.&quot;</p>

<p>Emirjeta Xhelili, 32, has been charged with misdemeanor assault as a hate crime, and was ordered held on $50,000 bond or $25,000 cash bail. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m running out of things to say, really,&quot; said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. &quot;Each [incident] is followed by another.&quot; He mentioned the Florida mosque of Pulse nightclub shooter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134947/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/orlando_gay_nightclub_shooter_repor.php">Omar Mateen</a>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134947/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/09/12/arson-suspected-in-fire-at-florida-mosque-attended-by-pulse-shooter-omar-mateen/">police believe</a> was intentionally set on fire this morning. And yesterday, the 15th anniversary of 9/11, someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134947/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Police-3-juveniles-believed-seen-after-rock-at-9217442.php">threw a rock</a> through a window at a mosque in Nashua, New Hampshire. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ve been seeing an unprecedented rise in anti-Muslim incidents in the last year,&quot; he added. &quot;Anti-Muslim bigotry is on the rise thanks to people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134947/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/25/aziz_ansari_donald_trump_makes_me_a.php">like Donald Trump</a>, and we&apos;re definitely seeing the impact of that.&quot;  </p>
