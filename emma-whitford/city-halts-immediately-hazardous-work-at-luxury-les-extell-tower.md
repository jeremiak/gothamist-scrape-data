<p>Construction at One &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/02/extell_tower_les_chinatown.php">One Percent</a>&quot; Manhattan Square&#x2014;a forthcoming luxury condominium on the Lower East Side that has replaced the neighborhood&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/20/with_pathmark_i.php">main supermarket</a>&#x2014;reportedly ground to a halt last week after the Department of Buildings issued a stop work order. </p>

<p>The DOB observed on January 14th that construction work at the 240 South Street site was causing &quot;movement&quot; at adjoining buildings, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ECBQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=2&amp;ecbin=35139289Y">department&apos;s website</a>. The inspection stemmed from a January 7th complaint from a resident at nearby 286 South Street, who said that her walls were cracking&#x2014;a complaint that has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2015/07/elusive-extell-refuses-to-confirm-building-heights-of-one-manhattan-square-and-other-updates/">leveraged by many neighbors</a> at local community board meetings since the summer. </p>

<p>Another stop work order was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/19/extell_cherry_street.php">issued last June</a>, soon after neighbors realized that their eyes were not deceiving them, and that nearby Cherry Street had in fact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/16/extell_tower_sinking_les.php">sunk several inches</a> since the developer began construction. Along the block, Extell&#x2019;s construction workers installed shoring braces to hold up the street and poured asphalt to level the cracking pavement. The work ban was lifted in less than a week. </p>

<p>A DOB spokesman confirmed today that the more recent stop work order&#x2014;technically a partial stop work order on all underpinning work on the back side of the building&#x2014;was issued on January 15th. Extell and its construction manager Lend Lease apparently continued working regardless, ceasing operations only when the DOB showed up for a follow-up inspection on February 17th. </p>

<p>Lend Lease confirmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://therealdeal.com/2016/02/24/dob-orders-work-halted-at-extells-one-manhattan-square/">in a statement to the Real Deal</a> that it was &quot;working with the project consultants to provide the Department of Buildings with documentation requested related to this matter.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The controversial tower&#x2014;soon to be equipped with a cigar room, golf simulation room, turkish baths, and other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/tag/extell-development">neighborhood-friendly amenities</a>&#x2014;is planned to rise 800 feet, casting a long shadow over the FDR Drive and nearby Rutgers Houses. Condominiums are slotted to sell for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000010/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2016/02/64438/">at least $1 million each</a>, and the project is scheduled for completion in 2019. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This piece has been updated with additional information from the DOB. A spokesman for the department confirmed on Thursday that the stop work order is partial, against all underpinning work on the back of the building. </p>
