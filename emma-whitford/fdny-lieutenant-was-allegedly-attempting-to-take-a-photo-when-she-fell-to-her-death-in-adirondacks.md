<p>An FDNY lieutenant from Staten Island fell to her death while hiking in the Adirondacks over the weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130400/https://www.facebook.com/FDNYWomen/posts/1622796618047472">according to</a> the FDNY Women&apos;s Benevolent Association. A family member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130400/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-ems-lieutenant-killed-upstate-hiking-accident-article-1.2679790">told the NY Post</a> that JoAnn Restko, who worked out of FDNY-EMS Station 7 in Chelsea, was attempting to take a picture when she fell off a cliff near Lake George. </p>

<p>&quot;I will miss my cousin,&quot; family member Lisa Reyes Rodgers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130400/https://www.facebook.com/FDNYWomen/posts/1622796618047472?comment_id=1622947468032387&amp;comment_tracking={%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22}">wrote in a tribute on Facebook</a>. &quot;She had an adventurous spirit and enjoyed living life to the fullest.&quot; </p>

<p>The Essex County Coroner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130400/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-FDNY-EMS-Lieutenant-Dies-in-Upstate-Hiking-Accident-383583981.html">confirmed to NBC</a> that Restko, 37, was hiking at Roaring Brook Falls in Keene, New York on Saturday, about four-and-a-half hours north of Manhattan. Her body was discovered between 80 and 100 feet below a ledge at the top of the falls. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130400/http://www.adirondack.net/business/roaring-brook-falls-11206/">website that details hiking routes in the Adirondacks</a> warns that the falls&apos; &quot;towering rock walls&quot; offer climbs &quot;for the more adventurous and sure-footed.&quot; </p>

<p>Restko, an avid hiker, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130400/https://www.facebook.com/joann.restko">filled her Facebook</a> with pictures from her trips. One posted this month shows Restko standing on an outcropping of rock at high elevation&#x2014;in the comments section, one friend wrote that the height &quot;makes me nervous for you.&quot; </p>

<p>Lenny Joyner, another paramedic posted at Restko&apos;s Chelsea station, passed away under similar circumstances in 2012. The 31-year-old was on a 14,000-foot summit near Aspen, Colorado that July when he fell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130400/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/fdny-paramedic-dies-fall-14-000-foot-summit-colorado-article-1.1121319">500 feet to his death</a>.  </p>
