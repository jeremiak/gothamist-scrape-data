title: Power Outage Brings Hours Of 'Chaos' To JFK Terminal 8
---

	
										<p>A power outage at JFK&apos;s Terminal 8 left hundreds of travelers in the dark, shut down elevators and escalators, and knocked out checked-bag screening machines and baggage claim conveyor belts on Tuesday. The outage lasted throughout the afternoon and into the evening, and was coupled with weather-related flight delays. The ordeal also came just a few days after Terminal 8 was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016151749/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/15/jfk_evacuation_video_olympics.php">evacuated for a false-alarm bomb threat that was actually just people cheering for the Olympics</a>.</p>

<p>A spokesman for American Airlines, which runs Terminal 8, confirmed that a power surge impacted three of the terminal&apos;s transformers around 2:00 p.m., prompting the outage. href=&quot;http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/16/jfk-airport-power-outage/&quot;&gt;CBS reports that the power was back up and running by 8:30 p.m. </p>

<p>The checked-bag screening system was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016151749/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160816/howard-beach/power-outage-hits-parts-of-jfk-airports-terminal-8">reportedly back online</a> by 7:45 p.m., allowing plenty of time for a sea of bags and suitcases to flood the check-in area. According to CBS, American Airlines resorted to manual screening. Many flights were canceled, and some passengers were re-routed to other airports. </p>

<p>&quot;I was supposed to fly out of JFK about 9 p.m. and they transferred me to LaGuardia at 6 o&apos;clock in the morning,&quot; one hapless passenger told the outlet. </p>

<p>Lights were out across most of the terminal as well. Also, no air conditioning! </p>

<p>The American Airlines spokesman said that there are &quot;scattered delays&quot; due to weather as of Wednesday morning, but all of the power outage-related issues are resolved. As a courtesy, he added, the airline is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016151749/https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/travel-alerts.jsp">offering to waive ticketing fees</a> for travelers scheduled for flights yesterday or today who would prefer to fly out of a different New York or New Jersey airport. </p>
