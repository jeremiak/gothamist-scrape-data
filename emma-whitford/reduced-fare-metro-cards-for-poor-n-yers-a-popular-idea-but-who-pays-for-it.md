<p>The price of a single MetroCard swipe will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/16/mta_subway_bus_fare_hike.php">likely jump to $3.00 next year</a>, prompting members of the MTA Board to talk seriously about the possibility of subsidizing bus and subway trips for New Yorkers living below the poverty line&#x2014;a &quot;social fare&quot; that transit advocates have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/half_price_metrocards_nyc.php">pushing for since the spring</a>. &quot;I have reason to believe that everyone on this board is sensitive to the social fare issue,&quot; MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast said at a board meeting earlier this month. &quot;So the question is how do we address it?&quot; </p>

<p>One proposal would establish a half-price MetroCard program for the City&apos;s working poor&#x2014;about 800,000 New Yorkers, excluding seniors and the disabled, who live at or below the federal poverty threshold, or $11,880 per year for a single adult. A joint study [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://b.3cdn.net/nycss/7169ea001b71493ce9_lvm6b2ptw.pdf">PDF</a>] released in conjunction with the campaign found that more than a quarter of low-income, working New Yorkers were unable to afford subway or bus fare at least once in 2015. </p>

<p>&quot;Because the MTA is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/24/bdb_monorail_ftw.php">cash-strapped</a>, we&apos;re saying that it makes sense for the program to be run by the city,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://www.ridersny.org/">Riders Alliance</a> member Rebecca Bailin told us this spring. &quot;If we&apos;re helping folks with housing and food, why not help them with this basic necessity?&quot;</p>

<p>But while advocates have urged the city to front the estimated $200 million subsidy, city and state-appointed board members have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161123/financial-district/mta-fare-hike-subway-bus-low-income-how-much-is">sparred</a> about who should pony up. And on Monday night, Mayor de Blasio said the social fare would be too expensive for the city to fund alone. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall-shows/2016/11/28/inside-city-hall-11-28-16.html">Speaking to NY1&apos;s Errol Lewis</a> on &quot;Inside City Hall,&quot; de Blasio suggested that this responsibility should fall to the MTA, the leadership of which is state-appointed. </p>

<p>&quot;Let me say on the surface obviously it&apos;s a very impressive idea,&quot; he allowed. &quot;That being said, here&apos;s the problem: One, the MTA should be responsible for the MTA.&quot; He continued: </p>

<blockquote>An additional $200 million is going to be very, very hard to find in the city&apos;s budget. That doesn&apos;t mean the MTA can&apos;t consider it as a priority. But for the city it&apos;s going to be tough. A noble idea, a commendable idea, we&apos;re going to look at it in the budget process, but it&apos;s a tough one.</blockquote>

<p>Riders Alliance spokesperson Nick Sifuentes saw a silver lining in the mayor&apos;s comments.  &quot;The mayor is calling this a noble proposal and we&apos;re glad to see that,&quot; he said. &quot;We think there are ways to get this done with the City Council, and we think we can make it happen.&quot; </p>

<p>The campaign has the support of 27 City Council members. Among them is Transportation Committee Chair Ydanis Rodriguez, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161123/financial-district/mta-fare-hike-subway-bus-low-income-how-much-is">stated earlier this month</a> that transit is a &quot;public good&quot; and that New York &quot;needs to begin treating it as such with investments that make it accessible to all.&quot;</p>

<p>But both the Mayor&apos;s Office and the MTA declined to directly address their willingness or ability to fund reduced fare MetroCards this week, instead rehashing their recent monetary contributions to NYC&apos;s public transit.  </p>

<p>&quot;Last year, in addition to the nearly $1 billion that the City provides the MTA annually for its operations, we committed an unprecedented $2.5 billion towards the agency&apos;s capital plan,&quot; said Mayoral Spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein. As for the reduced fare plan, &quot;This proposal will be evaluated as part of the fare-setting process for the MTA as well as the State and City budgets.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA already makes a substantial commitment to low-income City riders,&quot; wrote MTA Spokeswoman Beth DeFalco in an email. &quot;Including $625 million annually MTA spends to subsidize services primarily available for NYC-only residents.&quot; Among those services are free fares for schoolchildren and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://web.mta.info/nyct/paratran/guide.htm#fare">Access-A-Ride</a> for elderly and disabled New Yorkers, which is priced equivalent to public transit. </p>

<p>The Governor&apos;s Office deferred comment to the MTA.</p>

<p>But based on Governor Cuomo&apos;s recent MTA investments&#x2014;in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-major-steps-forward-lirr-expansion-project">commuter line repairs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/subway_facelift_shutdown.php">station renovations</a>, and on-train perks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/02/wifi_in_subways_whatever.php">like WiFi</a>&#x2014;MTA watchdog William Henderson said he doubts the state will jump right in with its own money if the city refuses to fund reduced fares. </p>

<p>&quot;If the city is unwilling to pay for it, it&apos;s going to be difficult to find a funding source that&apos;s acceptable,&quot; Henderson, who directs the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104552/http://www.pcac.org/">Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA</a>, predicted. &quot;The state has paid for a number of things recently and has a lot of commitments out there.&quot; </p>

<p>Another option would be to increase fares for riders, in order to subsidize those living at or below the poverty line&#x2014;an option Henderson said was far from ideal. </p>

<p>&quot;If there is no additional state support for a program, essentially some riders are going to subsidize others,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;re potentially setting up a situation where people just above the poverty line are paying higher fares so people just below are getting a subsidy. And that&apos;s a troubling scenario.&quot; </p>
