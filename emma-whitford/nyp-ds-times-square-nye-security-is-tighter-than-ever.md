					<p>More than 100 NYPD officers were already patrolling Broadway between 41st and 45th Streets at 9:30 this morning, conducting security checks for early arrivals at 44th Street and discarding backpacks in large plastic dumpsters as part of the most heavily-policed Times Square New Year&apos;s celebration in the city&apos;s history. By noon, the area was packed.</p>

<p>This year&apos;s security procedure is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/new-years-eve/nye-faq/index.aspx#15">detailed</a> for visitors on the Times Square Alliance Website, and will entail, for the first time, a minimum of two wand screenings per attendee&#x2014;once when entering through one of 14 access points to the so-called &quot;secure zone&quot; and again at the entrance to &quot;pens&quot; where people will wait for the ball to drop. </p>

<p>Backpacks of any kind are prohibited, a standard measure that nevertheless took many early arrivals by surprise this morning. We saw at least one officer patiently helping a tourist go through his backpack, while another complained that there was no time for such focused attentions. </p>

<p>We did, however, see attendees passing through with snacks and blankets. Alcohol is, as always, prohibited. </p>

<p>Other tight security measures this year include the sealing of manhole covers from 41st Street to 50th Street along 6th-8th Avenues, radiation detectors throughout the area, plainclothes officers dispersed throughout the crowd, and officers stationed at rooftop posts. Several bomb-sniffing dogs were already on the square this morning.</p>

<p>Newspaper vending machines and trash cans will also be removed or locked on Broadway and Seventh Avenue from 34th to 59th streets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/2015/12/29/nypd-extraordinary-security-times-square/78017052/">a counterterrorism tactic influenced by</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/explosions-reported-at-site-of-boston-marathon.html?pagewanted=all">2013 Boston Marathon bombing</a> when bombs were hidden in trash cans. </p>

<p>Attendees will be prohibited from passing back through security to use bathrooms today, prompting some to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/31/im_wearing_a_bunch_of_pads.php#photo-1">bring supplies</a>. </p>

<p>At a press conference earlier this week, City officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://nypost.com/2015/12/29/nypd-beefing-up-security-in-times-square-for-new-years-eve/">said</a> that there will be, at peak, about 6,000 police officers stationed on or near Times Square, about 600-800 more cops than New Year&apos;s Eve 2014. The city&apos;s 500-strong counterterrorism unit will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/2015/12/29/nypd-extraordinary-security-times-square/78017052/">on patrol</a>, in addition to 1,200 new recruits on their first assignment following graduation from the academy on Tuesday. </p>

<p>One million attendees are expected. </p>

<p>&quot;The usual elements will include thousands of uniformed police officers in the subways, in the air and the waterways around New York City,&quot; Chief of Detectives James O&apos;Neill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://abc7ny.com/news/security-to-be-tight-at-times-square-for-new-years-celebration;-1-million-expected/1139517/">told reporters</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Five thousand officers assigned to Times Square, hundreds of traffic agents, plus additional mobile cameras, chemical and radiation detectors, specially-trained police dogs sniffing for traces of explosives, cops on horseback, helicopters and police boats,&quot; he added. &quot;We will have observation posts manned by&#x2026; officers looking for suspicious activity, while cops in plainclothes keep watch on the crowds.&quot;</p>

<p>Heightened security has been the norm in NYC in the aftermath of November&apos;s terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 129 people, even as Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bratton have urged New Yorkers to conduct their business as usual. Threats have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-22/nyc-has-received-credible-threat-days-ahead-christmas-pix11-reports">rumored</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106094654/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/23/nypd_terror_alert.php">dismissed</a>.

<p>&quot;We are not aware of any threat we deem credible,&quot; NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said in a statement about New Year&apos;s Eve. &quot;We have a constant threat analysis stream that we are constantly reviewing. But again, we are not aware of any threat at this time we deem credible to this event in Times Square.&quot;</p>
