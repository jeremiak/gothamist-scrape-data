<p>The city has reached a $160 million deal with multi-millionaire entrepreneur Norm Brodsky, who for over a decade stood between North Brooklyn residents and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/01/year_after_williamsburg_warehouse_f.php">their dream</a> of a 28-acre park at Bushwick Inlet.</p>

<p>Former-Mayor Michael Bloomberg promised the park during a 2005 Brooklyn waterfront rezoning that paved the way for luxury condominium development. But the cost of acquiring the land ballooned, and Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/oops_no_money_for_promised_bushwick.php#photo-1">admitted in 2011</a> that he couldn&apos;t afford Brodsky&apos;s CitiStorage parcel. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/31/burning_williamsburg_warehouse_land.php#photo-1">charred</a>, 11-acre property on North 10th Street cuts through the middle of the long-stalled park. </p>

<p>The de Blasio administration has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/11/bushwick_inlet_park_purchase.php">bought up bits and pieces</a> since, but CitiStorage has remained elusive. Community members bit their nails earlier this year when Brodsky rejected&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/a_toast_to_evil.php">apparently mocked</a>&#x2014;the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/09/bushwick_inlet_park.php">$100 million offer</a> for the property, launching his own appeal for buyers and indicating that he&apos;d happily sell the site to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/07/as-property-auction-ends-city-and-land-owner-at-impasse-over-bushwick-inlet-park-plan-104075">developer of office space</a>, for the right price.</p>

<p>&quot;Today is the day we begin turning the full vision of Bushwick Inlet Park into a reality. After an extensive negotiation, we have struck a fair agreement to acquire the CitiStorage site,&quot; said Mayor de Blasio in a statement. &quot;This is an investment in the future of Brooklyn, and in the children, longtime residents and newcomers in this community.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Our administration keeps its promises,&quot; he added. &quot;When we commit to build a new park or a new school in a growing community, we deliver. We look forward to working with local officials, activists and residents as we design and build a Bushwick Inlet Park we can all be proud of.&quot; </p>

<p>This week&apos;s agreement lands well below Brodsky&apos;s $325 million ask. For context, the NY Times reports that the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/arts/design/price-tag-on-a-brooklyn-park-reaches-225-million-and-thats-only-the-beginning.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">spent $225 million</a> buying up nine acres of the proposed 28. In March, it dropped $53 million for another seven acres. Over a year ago Bushwick Inlet had already exceeded the Highline in taxpayer costs.</p>

<p>Reached on Tuesday, Brodsky praised Brooklyn Councilmember Stephen Levin for keeping the negotiations rolling. &quot;I&apos;m thrilled that the city has finally lived up to their promise for the community,&quot; he said. &quot;This certainly never would have happened without Steve Levin&apos;s tenacity.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016040209/http://www.bushwickinletpark.org/">Friends of Bushwick Inlet Park</a> co-chair Steve Chesler got the good news this morning, while disembarking an airplane in Florida. &quot;We&apos;re kind of in awe and in shock,&quot; he said. &quot;We kind of knew that things were working gradually towards a deal but we heard things were still precarious and fragile.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a lot of money but the alternative would have been horrific,&quot; Chesler added. &quot;Not just more development, but more development on promised open space.&quot; This upcoming March, he said, will be the 12 year anniversary of Bloomberg&apos;s promise. </p>

<p>&quot;We look forward to working with our community partners to realize a vision for Bushwick Inlet Park that truly serves Williamsburg-Greenpoint,&quot; said Parks Department Commissioner Mitchell Silver. </p>

<p>The city will need to conduct extensive environmental remediation on the CitiStorage site before it can put forward a timeline for park development, according to the Parks Department. </p>
