<p>Dozens of Greenpoint residents crowded a church basement on the west edge of McGolrick Park on Thursday night to question officers from the 94th Precinct about recent reports of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/20/greenpoint_assaults_brooklyn.php">assaults on women</a> in the neighborhood, including an alleged rape that has been widely discussed on social media. </p>

<p>&quot;We haven&apos;t seen any signs [posted] in the neighborhood or increased police presence, and yet we all know people who know this girl,&quot; said Sarah Sealy, a Greenpoint resident, referring to the alleged rape victim. </p>

<p>In the absence of concrete information from the police, some said they suspect a particular group of teenagers that gathers near-daily in the park, on the Monitor Street side, some of whom have been accused of vandalism and assault in the past. &quot;A lot of what was being said is that it was teenagers of mixed race,&quot; said one local shop owner, who asked that her name be withheld for fear of retribution. &quot;Then our minds immediately, for a lot of us, go to these kids.&quot; </p>

<p>On September 13th around 2 a.m., police say a 34-year-old Greenpoint woman was assaulted by three males of unknown age, possibly on Sutton Street between Driggs and Nassau Avenues, and sustained &quot;cuts and bruises to her neck and hip area.&quot; A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831/https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%22%20I%20just%20ran%20into%20an%20old%20friend%20who%20had%20a%20beyond%20horrible%20thing%20happen%20to%20her%20">message posted on Facebook</a> on the 15th by a friend of the victim, and reposted numerous times since, describes the assault as a rape committed by a group of teenagers. The posting states that the victim was also stabbed in the side of her neck. </p>

<p>A 36-year-old woman was knocked to the ground from behind on Driggs Avenue on September 14th&#x2014;possibly by a group of teenagers, according to the victim. Other reports include a woman robbed by two men on North Henry Street earlier this month, and another robbed while sitting on a bench in the park. Police have not confirmed any connections between these incidents, and according to the precinct&apos;s second-in-command, who was on hand for the meeting, details about the purported rape that has galvanized the community are shaky. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016__03_gp12.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/2016__03_gp12.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i>Police said earlier this week that one victim was allegedly assaulted on Sutton Street between Nassau and Driggs.

<p>&quot;I feel a little awkward that we&apos;re here because of an incident that it&apos;s really hard for us to respond to, because we don&apos;t have an official report of the crime that&apos;s been circulating around on the internet,&quot; Captain Stefan Komar said Thursday. &quot;We&apos;re not, at this point, getting the cooperation that we need [from the victim].&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to come across as being insensitive,&quot; Komar added. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s because this person doesn&apos;t want too much attention. It could be embarrassing. But we have specialists who deal with this as professionals, and we still haven&apos;t been able to get an exact location. At this point we&apos;re not even sure if it happened in this neighborhood.&quot; </p>

<p>Many attendees acknowledged that there is a disconnect (a &quot;gulf,&quot; according to meeting organizer Emily Gallagher) between the warnings and commentary circulating online, and the information 94th Precinct officers have provided. </p>

<p>&quot;If the victim doesn&apos;t feel comfortable pressing charges, that doesn&apos;t mean it didn&apos;t happen,&quot; said Jenny Makholm, a resident of 12 years. &quot;That just means a criminal investigation can&apos;t happen.&quot; </p>

<p>Others said the 94th Precinct was to blame&#x2014;that the police seldom respond to their calls in a timely manner, and that, anecdotally, there seems to be a lack of empathy for women bringing assault allegations. </p>

<p>&quot;When I&apos;m telling people, &apos;Did you hear anything? What&apos;s going on?&apos; What I am getting from a lot of people, and it&apos;s a lot of females, is that the 94th Precinct doesn&apos;t do anything,&quot; said Debbie Tenney, a longtime resident. &quot;Now, if this is the impression they are getting, maybe that&apos;s why people aren&apos;t reporting what&apos;s happening.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I would feel better if I saw cops patrolling,&quot; she added. </p>

<p>Komar said that the precinct is in the process of shifting officers to the eastern piece of its jurisdiction near the park, a ten-to-fifteen-minute walk from the closest subway stations, and a distance from the bustle of North Williamsburg&apos;s commercial strips.</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re gravitating to this area a lot more,&quot; Komar said. &quot;This is a very quiet area of the precinct, compared to others. I&apos;m sure you can imagine how busy we are on Bedford Avenue, on Wythe Avenue.&quot; </p>

<p>Brooklyn Assemblyman Joseph Lentol <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831/https://www.scribd.com/document/324952888/Letter-to-Commissioner-James-O-Neill-Requesting-Increased-Police-Staffing-at-90th-94th-Precincts">sent a letter to NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill</a> on Thursday, requesting additional officers for the 94th and 90th precincts in response to the assault allegations and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/06/williamsburg_fatal_shooting.php">a recent shooting on the Williamsburg waterfront</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="092016McGorlickPark.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/092016McGorlickPark.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Scott Heins / Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;Let&apos;s talk about our own fears and our own experiences, rather than things that we heard or people that we think are at fault,&quot; urged Gallagher, the meeting facilitator, on Thursday. </p>

<p>Yet many locals peppered accounts of their own experiences with secondhand accounts, and reports of park vandalism from years past. Accusations against local teenagers ranged from quality-of-life offenses like weed-smoking, drinking and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831/https://greenpointers.com/2013/07/17/mcgolrick-park-punks-vandalize-start-fires-assault-dogs/">vandalism</a>, to verbal and physical assault, including reports of friends and acquaintances struck with rocks and bats. One woman said teens in the park called her friend racial slurs. </p>

<p>&quot;They&apos;re rowdy, they&apos;re disrespectful to property, plants, trees, people,&quot; said a 55-year-old woman who&apos;s lived in the neighborhood for eight years. &quot;I don&apos;t know how much can come of this regarding these specific [assault] crimes, but I know I speak for a lot of people.&quot;  </p>

<p>Sam Parks, who moved to Greenpoint three weeks ago from the Lower East Side, was nonplussed by the milder allegations. &quot;I spent 30 years of my life skateboarding, and if I was their age I&apos;d be doing the exact same thing, because why the hell not?&quot; he said. &quot;The concern is that people have attached this weird run-for-your-life mentality to these kids.&quot; </p>

<p>At the end of Thursday&apos;s meeting, most of the community suggestions for increasing safety involved steering teenagers out of the park. </p>

<p>&quot;Classical music in the park has been shown to drive out young people,&quot; said Makholm. &quot;There&apos;s this thing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032831/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrewnzQYrPI">called the mosquito</a> that&apos;s a certain pitch that young people can hear but we cannot. So, some out-of-the box solutions that don&apos;t necessarily go into direct confrontation with these young people, but direct them elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Later, she described the ideas as crime prevention solutions, as many women feel &quot;abandoned and [that] their concerns for safety are dismissed by the authorities.&quot; </p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, a group of about 10 young men in their late teens and early twenties sat along a row of benches on the eastern edge of McGolrick Park, near Monitor Street, passing a joint. They said they hadn&apos;t heard about the planned community meeting, but had seen the rape allegations on Facebook. </p>

<p>&quot;This is pretty much all we do,&quot; said one member of the group (everyone present declined to provide a name). &quot;We sit here and smoke pot. I don&apos;t know why people think we would do something like that&#x2014;why we would even be associated with something like that.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I understand we&apos;re a pretty rowdy crowd,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>&quot;Smoking weed don&apos;t make you go kill people and rape people,&quot; added another one of the group. &quot;You chill the fuck out.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I think it&apos;s people from other neighborhoods who come here,&quot; said another. &quot;They do it and they just dip.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re to blame,&#x201D; said Heather, who lives on the Monitor side of the park, later that evening. &quot;I think that&apos;s one of the largest problems. We don&apos;t know who to look for. We don&apos;t know who to be cautious for, so then people are just like, maybe it&apos;s them.&#x201D;</p>
