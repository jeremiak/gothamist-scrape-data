title: Multi-Millionaire Mocks City's "Lowball" $100 Million Offer For Brooklyn Park Site
---

	
										<p>Norm Brodsky, the multi-millionaire entrepreneur who for years has stood between North Brooklyn residents and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/01/year_after_williamsburg_warehouse_f.php">dream of a 28-acre park at Bushwick Inlet</a>, poured salt into the wounds of weary local activists this week. Not only did he scoff at the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/09/bushwick_inlet_park.php">$100 million offer</a> for the 11-acre CitiStorage site that stubbornly divides the promised park in two, he also celebrated the deadline of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/08/brodsky_bushwick_inlet_park.php">auction for a higher bidder</a> with pictures of businessmen tossing back bourbon in honor of his &quot;results.&quot; </p>

<p>Former-mayor Michael Bloomberg promised Bushwick Inlet Park as part of a major Williamsburg waterfront rezoning initiative in the early aughts, grossly underestimating the cost of the future parkland. Since then, the city has gradually purchased surrounding parcels of the park site, even as Brodsky has indicated that he&apos;d happily sell the site to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/07/as-property-auction-ends-city-and-land-owner-at-impasse-over-bushwick-inlet-park-plan-104075">developer of office space</a>, for the right price. </p>

<p>Now, though Brodsky has yet to announce a top bidder for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://www.masseyknakal.com/listings/detail.aspx?lst=24533&amp;n=&amp;pt=&amp;l=&amp;pr=&amp;ag=&amp;k=&amp;nc=&amp;ptc=&amp;prc=&amp;pi=0&amp;ps=10&amp;tpg=48&amp;s=0&amp;ty=6&amp;r=2&amp;tt=">his parcel</a>, glimpses of his triumphant toasting reveal a breathtaking degree of self-satisfaction. Among the revelers is Robert Levin, the CEO of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/https://twitter.com/rslmedia">RSL Media</a>, a company that makes &quot;compelling content&quot; for small businesses. </p>

<p>Reached for comment, Brodsky said only, &quot;Process went very well and we are proceeding.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier, he publicly snubbed the the city&apos;s &quot;low ball&quot; offer, and crafted an I-told-you-so tweet, apparently directed at the advocates and politicians who&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/is_bushwick_inlet_park_worth_all_th.php">urged him to accept the $100 million</a> through numerous petitions, press conferences and protests. </p>

<p>&quot;We just don&apos;t know what to think of this,&quot; said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://www.bushwickinletpark.org/">Friends of Bushwick Inlet Park</a> co-chair Steve Chesler on Friday, adding, &quot;At the end of the day, no one in our organization is saying anything negative directly towards [Brodsky].&quot; </p>

<p>According to Chesler, his group recently installed a banner near CitiStorage that&apos;s been counting down the days Brodsky has left to accept the city&apos;s offer&#x2014;a tactic he says Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams suggested. </p>

<p>Public comments on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/https://www.change.org/p/mayor-de-blasio-mr-norman-brodsky-bushwick-inlet-let-s-work-together-to-build-a-park">pro-park petition</a> have gotten a bit combative though, Chesler conceded. &quot;Most of the comments are amicable, but some people are like, &apos;How much money do you need?&apos;&quot; he said.  </p>

<p>The CitiStorage site is in need of extensive environmental remediation, and is currently under zoning restrictions that require any new building to incorporate a significant amount of parking, according to the mayor&apos;s office. Chesler said Friday that he can&apos;t imagine this makes the site very attractive to developers. </p>

<p>&quot;Without any type of rezoning it&apos;s a very risky investment, because of those contingencies&#x2014;the parking and the remediation of the land,&quot; he said. And rezoning seems unlikely. In February, Mayor de Blasio promised that his administration &quot;would never accept a rezoning here that did not have the support of the councilman and community.&quot; </p>

<p>But Brodsky has indicated that he is not overly concerned. An anonymous broker for Brodsky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://www.wsj.com/articles/city-bids-100-million-for-citistorage-complex-1465517943?mod=rss_newyork_real_estate">told the Wall Street Journal</a> last month that the property was on the market for $325 million. </p>

<p>&quot;The land for sale is as is, and ... Williamsburg/Greenpoint is a mecca for office space now, so that&apos;s what you can build there,&quot; Brodsky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114450/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/07/as-property-auction-ends-city-and-land-owner-at-impasse-over-bushwick-inlet-park-plan-104075">told Politico earlier this week</a>. &quot;I have no illusions that it&apos;s going to be rezoned.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s office confirmed on Friday that while Brodsky set his own auction deadline for July 20th, he still technically has a two-week window to accept the city&apos;s $100 million offer. </p>

<p>&quot;The administration believes this is a fair and appropriate offer. In fact, this offer represents approximately $3 million more per acre than the average price paid for other sites contained within the Bushwick Inlet Park footprint,&quot; stated Mayoral spokeswoman Natalie Grybauskas on Friday. &quot;Our focus is on a negotiated sale.&quot; </p>
