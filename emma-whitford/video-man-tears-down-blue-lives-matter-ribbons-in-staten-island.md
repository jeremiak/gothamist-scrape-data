										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="072716_Ribbons2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043559im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/072716_Ribbons2.jpeg" width="230" height="374"> <br> <i style=" width:230px; ;display:block"> (screenshot)</i></div> A Staten Island man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043559/https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Stephen%20Anthony%20Varvaro">shamed on Facebook</a> this week after a video circulated of him walking down a residential street ripping Blue Lives Matter ribbons off of trees and signposts. The cellphone video, filmed by local Steve Worona, escalates into a shouting match between himself and the man pulling down the ribbons, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043559/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/man_who_took_down_blue_ribbons.html">identified by the Staten Island Advance</a> as one Stephen Varvaro. <p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s a bit of their exchange, punctuated with heavily-accented insults: </p>

<blockquote>Varvaro: Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

<p>Worona: All lives matter! All lives matter! Blue lives save all lives! </p>

<p>Varvaro: Whatever, bro. </p>

<p>Worona: You&apos;re disgusting. </p>

<p>Varvaro: <em>You&apos;re</em> disgusting.</p>

<p>[....]</p>

<p>Varvaro: All lives are not being prosecuted right now&#x2014;black lives are.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The video ends with Varvaro ripping off a ribbon, kissing it, and dropping it like he&apos;s dropping a mic: </p>

<p>The Advance reports that families of local cops hung the ribbons around the neighborhood shortly after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043559/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/08/snipers_kill_5_dallas_police_office.php#photo-1">five Dallas police officers were fatally shot</a> in early July. Days previous, three black men had been killed at the hands of police officers, prompting large-scale Black Lives Matter protests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043559/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/08/nyc_police_shooting_protest.php#photo-1">in New York City</a> and across the country. </p>

<p>The online response to Varvaro&apos;s act was swift and threatening, and came primarily from people who found his actions offensive. Many sent messages to a hair salon where Varvaro apparently used to work. </p>

<p>Varvaro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043559/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/man_who_took_down_blue_ribbons.html">told the Advance today</a> that while the threats are an overreaction, he&apos;s sorry for tearing the ribbons. </p>

<p>&quot;What I thought they meant was to hell with Black Lives Matter,&quot; he said. &quot;I assumed, I was hasty, I acted in anger. I didn&apos;t see blue when I saw the blue ribbons, I saw red and I was angry and I lost control.&quot;<br>
