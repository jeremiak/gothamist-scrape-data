<p>A Long Island man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090725/http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/pressrelease/prview.aspx?id=ter&amp;prid=206&amp;year=2016">arrested early Thursday morning</a> when local police discovered swastika flags, a framed portrait of Adolf Hitler, and bomb-making instructions inside his home during a warranted search, according to a press release from the Suffolk County police department. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="061716_Perkowski.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090725im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/061716_Perkowski.jpeg" width="275" height="333"> <br> <i style=" width:275px; ;display:block"> Edward Perkowski (via Suffolk County Police). </i></div> Police say Edward Perkowski, 29, was also stockpiling guns and ammunition&#x2014;a .40-caliber Glock and six assault rifles, as well as four rifles, 25 high-capacity magazines, a shotgun, a stun gun, and 5,000 rounds of ammo. Less sinister findings allegedly included 26 grams of mushrooms, four ounces of weed, and $42,940 in cash. <p></p>

<p>Fourteen knives were also allegedly recovered from the Mount Sinai home, at 22 Miller Place Middle Island Road. </p>

<p>The bomb-making instructions, some of them handwritten, were stacked in a black binder, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090725/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-arrested-after-guns-bomb-making-plans-found-at-li-home/1388708/">ABC reports</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090725/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/16/long-island-brothers-weapons-drugs-arrest/">According to CBS</a>, the binder also contained a &quot;racist manifesto.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Today&apos;s search warrant might have prevented a deadly, violent incident, like the one we recently saw in Orlando,&quot; Suffolk County police commissioner Timothy Sini <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090725/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/nyregion/weapons-cache-and-bomb-making-instructions-found-at-long-island-home.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur">told reporters on Thursday</a>, after the 6:00 a.m. raid. </p>

<p>Perkowski has been arrested on various criminal weapon and drug possession charges. He lives with his brother, 25-year-old Sean Perkowski, who was arrested on an outstanding bench warrant. The town of Brookhaven has condemned their house for safety violations.</p>

<p>Neighbors told ABC that they had been making complaints about the Perkowski house for some time, suspecting drug activity. &quot;The house has been a known house,&quot; neighbor John Leonard told reporters, adding, &quot;the police are there every couple of months.&quot;</p>

<p>Attorney Matt Tuohy, representing the older Perkowski, told the outlet that his client owns a legitimate military surplus business. Tuohy, who plans to fight the charges, did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.</p>

<p>The Perkowski brothers will be arraigned in Central Islip this afternoon. </p>
