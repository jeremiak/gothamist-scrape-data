<p>City Hall plans to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/bedford-union_armory.php">develop</a> a vacant, century-old armory in Crown Heights, a few blocks from the coffee shops and boutiques of Franklin Avenue, has hit multiple roadblocks in recent months as long-time residents protest a project they fear will price them out of the neighborhood. Slate Property Group, embroiled in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/les_luxury_condos_everywhere.php">$16.5 million Rivington House scandal</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/bedford_armory_slate_deal.php">backed out</a> last August over bad press. Then Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/carmelo-anthony-drops-support-crown-heights-armory-deal-article-1.2791283">revoked his endorsement</a>. And this month, City Hall canceled a public meeting on the project&#x2014;a few days after state and federal politicians filed a Freedom of Information Law request for the project&apos;s financials, timeline and economic impact. </p>

<p>&quot;Advocates and neighborhood residents all need an opportunity to evaluate each aspect of this Bedford Union Armory development proposal,&quot; said Brooklyn Senator Jesse Hamilton in a statement. &quot;We still have not had our most basic questions answered.&quot; </p>

<p>Hamilton filed the request to the NYC Economic Development Corporation, with Congresswoman Yvette Clarke and State Assemblymembers Diana Richardson and Walter Mosley. A spokeswoman for the EDC said Tuesday that the meeting, originally scheduled for last week, will now likely happen in early March. </p>

<p>&quot;We are always happy to engage in additional conversations, and look forward to ultimately delivering much needed community and recreational space for Crown Heights,&quot; the EDC spokeswoman said. </p>

<p>The Bedford Union Armory project is slotted to include a mix of market-rate and affordable apartments, as well as offices, community space, and a rec center featuring basketball courts, a swimming pool and an indoor turf field. While the proposal calls for 50 percent affordable housing, the project will tentatively include just 18 units, out of a total 330, for renters who make 37 percent of the Area Median Income, or $31,068 for a family of three. An additional 49 apartments will be set at 50 percent of the AMI, or $38,835. </p>

<p>According to an NYU Furman Center report, the 2014 Crown Heights median income was between $41,867 and $44,961 for a household of three. Neighbors worry that the proposed 99 additional apartments at 110 percent of the AMI, or $85,437 for a family of three, will put more pressure on local rent-stabilized tenants who are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/15/crown_heights_landlord_battle.php">facing harassment</a> from profit-seeking landlords. </p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong. I&apos;m for improving the community,&quot; said Vaughn Armour, 66, a member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://nycommunities.org/">New York Communities for Change</a> and Crown Heights resident of 16 years. &quot;But don&apos;t come build on top of us and tell us we have to leave.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="121715rendering2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/121715rendering2.jpg" width="640" height="414"> <br> <i> (NYCEDC)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Before developer BFC Partners is confirmed for the project, and affordability levels are set in stone, the proposal has to go through a lengthy public review process&#x2014;the very process delayed this month. But while advocates would like to see the city&apos;s Request for Proposal scrapped in favor of a project that is completely affordable for Crown Heights renters, local Councilmember Laurie Cumbo, who has a big hand in project negotiations, said that she would prefer to see the current proposal through. </p>

<p>&quot;Let&apos;s just continue to negotiate, see what the final outcome is, and if it&apos;s satisfactory,&quot; Cumbo told Gothamist in a phone interview Tuesday. &quot;If it&apos;s going to have a negative impact, then we vote it down and move forward.&quot; </p>

<p>Cea Weaver, research and policy director for NYCC, a grassroots organizing group, was skeptical that any plan negotiated with BFC would hit the affordability levels that the community needs. &quot;Any big change you need to advocate for needs to happen before land use process starts,&quot; she said. Because the Bedford Union Armory is owned by the city, NYCC has argued, it could be sold cheaply to a not-for-profit developer with a mission to build deeply-affordable housing. </p>

<p>Cumbo added that affordable housing is not her only priority in considering the viability of the armory project. She is also intrigued by a project that would generate construction jobs in the neighborhood, and is slotted to include a recreational space for local youth. </p>

<p>&quot;When we were meeting with 1 Police Plaza to discuss <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/27/nypd_to_jouvert_revelers_do_not_sho.php">J&apos;Ouvert</a> and how to make that particular weekend safer, it was brought to our attention that there are approximate 30 known gangs in the area, and there continues to be a serious challenge with gun violence in that area,&quot; Cumbo said. &quot;Part of my desire, whether it be for this project or perhaps through another project, is [to help] the youth of that community.&quot; </p>

<p>A group of local youth and recreation nonprofits endorsed the rec-center aspect of the project in an op-ed this month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621130318/http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/op-ed-recreational-facilities-bedford-armory-will-win-crown-heights/">writing</a> that Crown Heights is &quot;in desperate need of quality recreational facilities for youth sports leagues, senior activities and other neighborhood-based programming.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;At the same time, we don&apos;t want to put together an economic development project in our neighborhood that would displace the very people we are trying to serve,&quot; Cumbo added. &quot;It&apos;s a very complicated situation.&quot; </p>

<p>Cumbo is hosting a public meeting on the Bedford Armory project this Thursday evening, at Medgar Evers College.  </p>

<p>&quot;Cumbo is having a meeting because she is responding to a vast amount of community displeasure,&quot; Weaver surmised. &quot;But a meeting is not enough. We need to translate this into a promise to vote &apos;no&apos; and restart the process in a way that&apos;s more democratic.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing lost by spending the time to negotiate the project,&quot; Cumbo challenged. &quot;There is absolutely no downside to that.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Our team continues to incorporate community feedback, as we have throughout this process, and we always welcome additional input from local stakeholders,&quot; said BFC Partners in a statement. &quot;We look forward to working with community and non-profit partners to make the new Armory a success for all Crown Heights families.&#x201D;</p>
