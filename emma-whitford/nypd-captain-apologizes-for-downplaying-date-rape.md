<p>Three days after the head of the NYPD&apos;s 94th Precinct came under fire for publicly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/23/greenpoint_assault_crackdown.php">downplaying the severity of date rape</a>, Captain Peter Rose issued an apology on Twitter, insisting that his comments mischaracterized NYPD procedure. </p>

<p>&quot;I deeply regret the statements I made last week about rape,&quot; Rose stated. &quot;I failed to communicate accurately how I respond to reports of rape, and the actions the Department as a whole take.&quot; </p>

<p>He continued: </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My sincerest apologies for the comments I&apos;ve made. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620/https://t.co/TL4yC8JChq">pic.twitter.com/TL4yC8JChq</a></p>&#x2014; NYPD 94th Precinct (@NYPD94Pct) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620/https://twitter.com/NYPD94Pct/status/818547773054349312">January 9, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Captain Rose appeared to characterize date rape as less serious than stranger rape on multiple occasions. During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170106/greenpoint/rapes-nypd-arrest">an interview with DNAInfo published Friday</a>, reporter Gwynne Hogan asked Rose to address the fact that reports of sexual assaults and attempted sexual assaults had increased in the neighborhood, from 8 in 2015 to 13 in 2016: a 62 percent jump. Apparently attempting to provide reassuring context, Rose said that &quot;some of them were Tinder, some of them were hookup sites, some of them were actually coworkers. It&apos;s not a trend that we&apos;re too worried about because out of 13 [sex attacks], only two were true stranger rapes.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="010917_Rape.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/010917_Rape.jpg" width="300" height="300"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Captain Rose (via Twitter). </i></div> Rose reiterated this opinion during a community council hearing, reportedly saying that the alleged assaults weren&apos;t &quot;total abomination rapes&quot; where &quot;strangers are being dragged off the streets. If there&apos;s a true stranger rape, a random guy picks up a stranger off the street, those are the troubling ones. That person has, like, no moral standards.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Advocates said Monday afternoon that Rose&apos;s apology doesn&apos;t hold up to scrutiny. Jane Manning of the National Organization for Women pointed to the fact that 10 out of the 13 reported incidents&#x2014;all acquaintance rapes&#x2014;had not been solved. &quot;That is a horrible statistic,&quot; Manning said. This weekend, NOW announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620/http://beta.gothamist.com/2017/01/08/national_organization_for_women_to.php">plans</a> to protest outside of the 94th Precinct. Those plans aren&apos;t changing. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s good that he apologized, but an apology doesn&apos;t fix the problem,&quot; Manning said. &quot;Because the mentality behind his comments is a pervasive mentality in our criminal justice system.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We want a top-to-bottom overhaul of how rape cases are handled by the police,&quot; she added. &quot;And we want a thorough investigation to find out if these appalling numbers are an aberration, or if they are a symptom of a city-wide problem.&quot;  </p>

<p>Last fall, the 94th Precinct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/23/greenpoint_assault_crackdown.php">was criticized</a> for what local women deemed a lax response to an uptick in reported rapes. &quot;What I am getting from a lot of people, and it&apos;s a lot of females, is that the 94th Precinct doesn&apos;t do anything,&quot; said Debbie Tenney, a longtime resident, at the time. </p>

<p>&quot;If the victim doesn&apos;t feel comfortable pressing charges, that doesn&apos;t mean it didn&apos;t happen,&quot; added Jenny Makholm, a resident of 12 years. &quot;That just means a criminal investigation can&apos;t happen.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Rape is rape, in New York City and everywhere else,&quot; Mayoral spokesman Eric Phillips stated, following Rose&apos;s comments. &quot;The crime merits no moral qualification and does not involve shades of criminality or degrees of danger.&quot; </p>

<p>The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621030620/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-nypd-commander-apologizes-dismissive-rape-comments-article-1.2941736?utm_content=buffera0345&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">reports</a> that Rose has not been disciplined for his statements. </p>
