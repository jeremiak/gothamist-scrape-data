<p>Dozens of cops and federal investigators last week searched a Park Slope brownstone that served as headquarters for a drug sale operation, according to the NYPD. The early morning search turned up large quantities of cocaine and weed and two loaded firearms, among other evidence. </p>

<p>According to neighbors, Ernest Jacobs, 38, and his girlfriend Ana Robles, 30, kept a relatively low profile at 30 St. John&apos;s Place between 5th and 6th Avenues, aside from an aggressive street-parking routine. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113154044/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161010/park-slope/ernest-jacobs-drug-dealer-weapons-arrest">DNAInfo reports</a> that Jacobs typically used orange parking cones to block off a spot for his white BMW&#x2014;and, neighbors believe, to assist customers coming and going from his apartment. </p>

<p>Neighbors also told the outlet that they&apos;d noticed four security cameras mounted on the building&apos;s exterior, pointed at the sidewalk below.</p>

<p>The October 5th search took place at 6:20 a.m., according to a criminal complaint filed with the Brooklyn District Attorney&apos;s office. Upon entry, police found Jacobs and Robles in their bedroom with their 7-year-old son, who is autistic. There was a cocked .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol on the bedroom floor with a round in the chamber, according to the report. Weed was recovered from the bedroom, and cocaine from the kitchen, as well as a 9-mm cartridge and a scale. A MAC-11 9-mm assault weapon was recovered from the basement. </p>

<p>Jacobs and Robles were both arrested and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminal possession of a weapon, as well as endangering the welfare of a child. Jacobs is being held on $150,000 cash bail, and Robles on $25,000 bail.</p>
