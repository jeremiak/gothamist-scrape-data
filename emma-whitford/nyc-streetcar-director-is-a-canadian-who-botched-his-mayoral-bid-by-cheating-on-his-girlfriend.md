<p>But with the support of his foot soldiers at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://www.nycedc.com/">Economic Development Corporation</a> and a newly formed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/13/business_interests_transit_advocate.php">pro-BQX nonprofit</a> made up of business interests, developers, urban planners and transit advocates, de Blasio has held firm to his &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/16/it_worked_for_north_haverbrook.php">noble experiment</a>.&quot; And this week, the city appointed a BQX Director with relevant street car experience (he used to serve as chair of the Toronto Transit Commission)... who also made a stir when everyone in Toronto learned he&apos;d been cheating on his girlfriend with a teenager&#x2014;repeatedly, inside his Toronto City Hall office. </p>

<p>39-year-old Adam Giambrone dropped out of the race for Mayor of Toronto in 2010 after one week, when leaked text messages revealed that he&apos;d been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/02/11/giambrones_girlfriend_tells_why_she_came_forward.html">cheating on his live-in girlfriend</a> (now wife), who he described to another woman as a political asset. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://nypost.com/2016/07/18/this-is-the-canadian-anthony-weiner-and-he-works-for-us-now/">The Post is calling him</a> the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Canadian Anthony Weiner</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Kristen Lucas, Giambrone&apos;s then-lover, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/02/11/giambrones_girlfriend_tells_why_she_came_forward.html">told The Toronto Star in 2010</a> that she started sleeping with Giambrone when she was 19. In one particularly damning text to Lucas, Giambrone reportedly wrote, &quot;You know I will be announcing I have a partner. It is someone named Sarah [McQuarrie], who I&apos;ve been involved with in the past. It is important for the campaign.&quot; </p>

<p>When text messages between Lucas and Giambrone leaked, Giambrone, who served as chair of the Toronto Transit Commission from 2006 to 2010, dropped out of politics for a while. (To be fair, the guy Toronto elected instead, Mayor Rob Ford, is arguably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://gawker.com/another-rob-ford-crack-video-is-for-sale-here-are-stil-1570134492">more tabloid-friendly</a>.) More recently, Giambrone&apos;s been traveling around as a streetcar expert and consultant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/brooklyn-queens-streetcar-plan-gets-a-czar.html">New York magazine reports</a>, helping launch systems in Montreal and Milwaukee. </p>

<p>As for his streetcar chops, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/brooklyn-queens-streetcar-plan-gets-a-czar.html">from New York magazine</a>: </p>

<blockquote>In Toronto, he spent years working on a network of suburban streetcars called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/http://torontolife.com/tag/transit-city/page/2/">Transit City</a> that mayor Rob Ford killed almost as soon as he took office in 2010. One element of that project, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134442/https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/crosstown.html">Eglinton Crosstown line</a>, has since been revived and is under construction, but the failure of the larger plan has left the city hobbled, says Toronto Globe and Mail architecture critic Alex Bozikovic. &quot;The vision Giambrone was pushing made a lot of sense, and it died for political reasons.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>&quot;When it comes to who will deliver on the city&apos;s next great transportation project, we&apos;re confident New Yorkers are more concerned with qualifications than years old text messages and past personal matters,&quot; said Mayor spokesman Austin Finan in a statement. &quot;Mr. Giambrone is a respected industry expert with extensive experience planning and launching new streetcar lines, including overseeing North America&#x2019;s largest streetcar system. We&apos;re excited to have him join the team.&quot; </p>

<p>Giambrone&apos;s salary, with the EDC, will be $160,000, according to the Post. (The EDC deferred comment to the Mayor&apos;s office.)</p>

<p>From a New Yorker&apos;s perspective, what&apos;s really troubling here is that, in his New York magazine interview, Giambrone apparently made a passing reference to the &quot;Downtown East Side.&quot;</p>
