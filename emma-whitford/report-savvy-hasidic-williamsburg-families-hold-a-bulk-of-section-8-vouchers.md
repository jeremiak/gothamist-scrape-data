<p>Families in Hasidic Williamsburg are using a large chunk of the City&apos;s limited stock of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/section-8/about-section-8.page">Section 8 vouchers</a> to maintain an island of below-market rate housing within one of the hottest real estate markets in NYC, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hasidic-neighborhood-b-klyn-top-beneficiary-section-8-article-1.2639120">a report</a> today from WNYC and the Daily News. </p>

<p>Federal records show that residents of Hasidic communities have historically applied for vouchers in bulk with the assistance of real estate-connected community organizations like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/http://www.unitedjewish.org/">United Jewish Organizations</a> (UJO), and use them to live in new apartments designed to suit large Hasidic families&#x2014;multi-bedrooms in low-slung buildings that don&apos;t necessitate elevators. </p>

<p>In February 2007 UJO helped 2,000 people apply for Section 8 in a single day (there were 200,000 applicants total during the 90-day window). And when HPD offered up 400 vouchers to Community Board 1 members after a 2008 rezoning, UJO helped 600 people apply in a matter of hours. </p>

<p>&quot;These are people who are poor, but they&apos;re not beaten down. They&apos;re savvy,&quot; Queens College professor Sam Heilman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/http://www.wnyc.org/story/section-8-part-two/">told WNYC</a>. &quot;They&apos;ve figured out a way to live with poverty, but not to be impoverished. That&apos;s the extraordinary story.&quot; </p>

<p>About 55% of Hasidic households in NYC live below the federal poverty line, outpacing the city average. But while many Section 8 holders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/20/landlord_voucher_discrimination.php">struggle to find landlords who will entertain their applications</a>&#x2014;despite anti-discrimination laws in place since the late aughts [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/downloads/pdf/misc/psb_100_13_8_107.pdf">PDF</a>]&#x2014; many Hasidic families can expect to find receptive landlords in their communities. </p>

<p>There were 1,394 Section 8 vouchers in Williamsburg&apos;s 9 Yiddish-speaking census tracts in the year 2000. By 2014, there were 3,296 voucher holders across 12 such tracts. These voucher holders are concentrated in formerly-industrial pockets of Bed-Stuy and Williamsburg, a.k.a. New Williamsburg, where Hasidic families have been converting factory buildings into apartments since the late 1990s, raising concerns about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/minority_groups_charge_discriminati.php">discriminatory rental practices</a>. </p>

<p>Citing local real estate attorneys and ex-community members, today&apos;s report also outlines how some powerful Hasidic landlords may also be charging tenants under the table, on top of Section 8. The vouchers cover about $1,050 per month in the neighborhood, according to the report&apos;s findings, while the maintenance cost for apartments is much steeper. </p>

<p>&quot;They&apos;ll do anything, including paying extra money above Section 8,&quot; one ex-Hasidic teenager whose father is a contractor told the News. &quot;So the landlords are asking it only because the tenants will pay it. The tenants will only pay it because they have no other option.&quot;</p>

<p>As property values <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/11/brooklyn_rent_obscene_forever.php">continue to spike</a> across NYC, Hasidic families are also taking their Section 8 vouchers to ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods upstate, where the subsidy goes farther. </p>

<p>While 120,000 NYC residents wait on the Section 8 waitlist, NYCHA records show that about 500 Section 8 holders have moved out of NYC, to predominantly-Hasidic villages like Monsey and Spring Village in Rockland and Monroe counties. Some families in the community follow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015525/https://twitter.com/sec8heimish">@Sec8heimish</a> on Twitter for regular updates on Section 8 waiting lists, and openings in New York and surrounding states. </p>
