<p>A 43-year-old homeless man is facing murder charges after turning himself in to the NYPD on Wednesday, following the fatal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426125451/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/mcdonalds_employee_fatally_stabbed.php">Monday morning stabbing</a> of a McDonald&apos;s night manager in the Bronx. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2016_01_agarcia.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426125451im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/2016_01_agarcia.jpg" width="270" height="364"> <br> <i style=" width:270px; ;display:block"> Adam Garcia</i></div> Rafael Gonzalez has been charged with manslaughter and second degree murder. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426125451/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/nyregion/man-arrested-in-fatal-stabbing-of-bronx-mcdonalds-manager.html">The NY Times reports</a> that he was a &quot;regular&quot; at the McDonald&apos;s where the stabbing took place, and frequently used the bathroom to clean up. <p></p>

<p>According to the NYPD, officers responded to a 911 call from the McDonald&apos;s at 5765 Broadway near West 236th Street, just before 4:30 a.m. on Monday. There, they found 28-year-old employee Adam Garcia with multiple stab wounds to his neck and torso. Garcia was pronounced dead at New York Presbyterian Hospital. </p>

<p>The murder took place less than a block from the 50th Precinct station house. </p>

<p>Garcia had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426125451/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/nyregion/police-seek-assailant-in-fatal-stabbing-of-bronx-mcdonalds-manager.html?_r=0">reportedly</a> stayed late after his Sunday night shift, and attempted to escort Gonzalez from the McDonald&apos;s were he had been sitting for about eight hours. </p>

<p>Police said the two men argued in the restaurant parking lot, and Gonzalez stabbed Garcia in the neck and chest multiple times before fleeing. Garcia managed to return to the restaurant, where a coworker called 911. The NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426125451/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/05/fatal_mcdonalds_stabbing.php">released surveillance footage</a> of the suspect soon after the attack. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426125451/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/man-charged-fatal-stabbing-bronx-mcdonald-worker-article-1.2488385">The News reports</a> that authorities were tipped off by two Bronx librarians who recognized Gonzalez in surveillance footage. The librarians said that they believed Gonzalez had harassed female employees at two local branches of the public library. The librarians tipped detectives off to Gonzalez&apos;s Facebook, prompting the NYPD to contact his family for confirmation. </p>

<p>Gonzalez is scheduled for arraignment on Thursday. Investigators described him earlier this week as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426125451/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/nyregion/police-seek-assailant-in-fatal-stabbing-of-bronx-mcdonalds-manager.html">mentally unbalanced</a>.&quot; </p>
