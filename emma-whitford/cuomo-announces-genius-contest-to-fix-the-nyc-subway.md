<p>Less than a week after Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/19/mta_cuomo_subway_broken.php">attempted to distance himself</a> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/13/subway_delays_mta_cuomo.php">steadily-deteriorating</a> Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the man who essentially controls the MTA took a decidedly different approach on Tuesday. Addressing a crowd at the City University of New York Graduate Center, Cuomo challenged the MTA to look internationally for &quot;groundbreaking and innovative solutions&quot; for the subway&apos;s crowding and delays. If the best solution requires funding beyond the State&apos;s $8 billion commitment to the MTA&apos;s five-year capital plan, Cuomo promised he&apos;ll find a way to pay for it. </p>

<p>&quot;If the MTA finds the technology and can deploy that technology, and if it requires additional capital money for the capital plan, I will fight for that additional money for the capital plan,&quot; Cuomo told the crowd, including members of the City Council and State legislature. </p>

<p>Andrew Albert, chair of the New York City Transit Riders Council and a nonvoting member of the MTA Board, chuckled during a phone interview following the announcement. &quot;He wasn&apos;t &apos;I don&apos;t run the MTA&apos; today, was he?&quot; </p>

<p>Cuomo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/https://www.ny.gov/programs/mta-genius-transit-challenge-reimagining-new-york-s-transportation-system">MTA Genius Transit Challenge</a> calls for signal system overhauls; new subway car designs or overhauls to the existing stock; and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/ferrari_bus_identical.php">because it&apos;s Cuomo</a>, WiFi and cell service throughout the system, tunnels included. The winner in each category will receive $1 million from the State. </p>

<p>&quot;Copenhagen [has] driverless electric trains that feature open ended cars,&quot; Cuomo said Tuesday. &quot;In Hong Kong, every station has high speed Wi-Fi. The ideas are out there. The technology is out there. We need to get those ideas and that technology here.&quot; </p>

<p>Watchdogs and advocates praised Cuomo&apos;s willingness to take responsibility on Tuesday, tempered with concerns about funding. &quot;Governor Cuomo is taking a vital step, which is to declare that it&apos;s squarely his responsibility to fix the subway,&quot; said John Raskin, Executive Director of the Riders Alliance. &quot;The next question is: what is the actual plan, and where will the Governor find the money to pay for it?&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="042717penn.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/042717penn.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> (Todd Seelie / Gothamist) </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Cuomo and his spokespeople emphasize the State&apos;s appropriation of around $5.4 billion of a promised $8 billion in capital funding. But that funding will only become available once the MTA has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/24/bdb_monorail_ftw.php">drained all of its capital resources</a> from years past, including debt and federal grants. Until then, the city&apos;s $1.8 billion contribution will also be under lock. </p>

<p>&quot;Although there have been commitments made by the state to basically make sure the money is there if it needs to be, we don&apos;t have specific sources for some of the funds in the capital fund right now,&quot; said William Henderson, director of the watchdog group Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA. &quot;And this stuff is going to be expensive.&quot; </p>

<p>The state legislature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2017/02/26/laguardia-airtrain-still-happening-reason/">raised the MTA&apos;s debt ceiling</a> to $55 billion in 2016, giving the authority more leeway to borrow. It is this borrowing, Albert said, that increases the MTA&apos;s debt and, in turn, puts &quot;more pressure on fares.&quot; </p>

<p>Henderson also predicted that public transit innovations successful in other cities might be more costly in NYC. &quot;Building transportation infrastructure is more expensive here than almost anywhere in the world,&quot; Henderson said. &quot;It&apos;s a 24-hour system, and the complications that develop, just because of what&apos;s in the ground already, are pretty amazing.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA is committed to delivering actionable, smart, innovative solutions in the short-term to fix problems that have festered for decades,&quot; said MTA Acting Director Ronnie Hakim, praising the &quot;genius&quot; proposal. Last week, the MTA announced a $20 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/15/mta_subway_rehab.php">six point plan</a> to address subway delays in the short term.</p>

<p>Also on Tuesday, Cuomo announced his willingness to take over much-needed renovations of Penn Station from Amtrak, which has owned the transit hub for decades, and prioritize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/tags/GatewayTunnel">the long-overdue Gateway Tunnel project</a>. Such a takeover would require federal funding, as well as money from the State and private partners, according to Cuomo. &quot;We come in the spirit of cooperation and creativity,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/21/cuomo_appeals_to_president_trump_fo.php">sent a letter</a> to President Donald Trump over the weekend, suggesting that responsibility for Penn Station shift to the Port Authority, or a private operator. Offering his own services Tuesday, Cuomo repeatedly cast doubt on Amtrak&apos;s ability to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/02/amtrak_says_penn_station_commuters.php">complete emergency track renovations on schedule this summer</a>.  </p>

<p>Under Amtrak, Cuomo predicted, &quot;I think you&apos;re going to see these breakdowns continue for the foreseeable future.&quot; </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Amtrak officials maintain they have everything under control. &quot;It is Amtrak&apos;s role and our responsibility to step up and run that station as well as we can, and that&apos;s exactly what we intend on doing,&quot; Amtrak CEO Wick Moorman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://nypost.com/2017/05/23/amtrak-wont-cede-control-of-penn-station-to-port-authority/">told the NY Post this week</a>. </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://media.amtrak.com/new-york-penn-station-infrastructure-renewal-program/">Tuesday press release</a>, Amtrak announced plans to bring in an outside infrastructure company to speed up the summer 2017 repairs. </p>

<p>According to Henderson, Cuomo&apos;s latest Penn Station promise raises the same concerns as today&apos;s promise of increased capital funding. President Trump&apos;s $1 trillion infrastructure promise is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711020820/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-budget-infrastructure_us_592450e4e4b03b485cb5557b?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000016&amp;section=politics">still a rough sketch</a>. &quot;Frankly there&apos;s a real question about what the federal government&apos;s willingness to fund some of these things is,&quot; Henderson said. </p>

<p>The Governor&apos;s Office did not immediately respond to an inquiry about how the State might cover additional capital costs.</p>

<p>&quot;We can&apos;t fault the Governor for not answering the funding question within two hours of his announcement,&quot; Henderson added. &quot;But eventually it has to be answered.&quot; </p>
