<p>The NYPD has arrested a 14-year-old boy accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120324/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/menorah_vandalized_in_upper_east_si.php">repeatedly vandalizing</a> a large wooden menorah in Carl Schertz Park on the Upper East Side, not far from Gracie Mansion.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120324/http://jpupdates.com/2015/12/14/breaking-man-who-vandalized-menorah-twice-near-mayors-house-in-manhattan-arrested/">JP Updates reports</a> that the suspect was arrested at his Manhattan home on Friday evening. According to the news outlet, detectives noted that the boy&apos;s parents were &quot;very cooperative.&quot; Once in custody, he admitted to vandalizing the menorah on two consecutive nights because he was &quot;bored.&quot; </p>

<p>The NYPD would not confirm the suspect&apos;s name because he is a minor, but said that the alleged vandal was charged with two counts of criminal mischief as a hate crime.  </p>

<p>The vandalism, which took place around 12:30 a.m. on Saturday December 5th and Sunday December 6th&#x2014;the night before Hanukkah, and late on the first night of the holiday&#x2014;prompted an investigation by the city&apos;s Hate Crime Task Force. The Mayor&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426120324/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Menorah-Vandalize-Carl-Schurz-Park-Jewish-Hanukkah-Celebration-360815361.html">put out a statement</a> after the second incident, reminding New Yorkers that &quot;incidents like this have no place here or anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Following the Sunday night vandalism, Rabbi Elie Weinstock of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun said, &quot;Last night we gathered to kindle the menorah, bringing light to the world and this morning we found that we were met by an act of darkness. But light always overcomes darkness, and tonight we plan to light the menorah again.&quot;</p>
