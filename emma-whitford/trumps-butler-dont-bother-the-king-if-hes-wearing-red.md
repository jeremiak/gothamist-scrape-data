<p>When he&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825153833/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/13/donald_trump_encourages_violent_sup.php">egging on</a> his most violent supporters and amassing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825153833/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/11/immigrant_model_trump.php">wage-theft</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825153833/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/trump_is_being_sued_for_stolen_wage.php">lawsuits</a>, Donald Trump migrates south to Mar-a-Lago, a 118-room &quot;Mediterranean-style manse&quot; in Palm Beach where his long-time and apparently deeply appreciative butler maintains a blissful equilibrium of rock-hard steaks and bundles of print newspapers.</p>

<p>The Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825153833/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/us/politics/donald-trump-butler-mar-a-lago.html">toured Trump&apos;s Mar-a-Lago estate</a> with 74-year-old Anthony Senecal recently, who noted, &#x201C;You can always tell when the king is here.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;king&quot; also enjoys peeling $100 bills from his pocket wad and handing them to an appreciative garden staff: &quot;You&apos;re a Hispanic and you&apos;re in here trimming the trees and everything, and a guy walks up and hands you a hundred dollars... and they love him, not for that, they just love him.&quot; </p>

<p>A few more gems from the elderly butler who Trump apparently loves too much to let out of his sight (&quot;Tony, to retire is to expire&quot;).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Senecal recalls how Trump&apos;s father, Fred Trump, once stepped out of his limo at the estate and remarked &quot;Somebody better get that coin,&quot; prompting Senecal to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve a penny from the gravel. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>There&apos;s a salon on the estate, but Trump insists on doing his own hair. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Trump gets about four hours of sleep a night. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>One time, years ago, Senecal was warned that Trump was in a &quot;sour&quot; mood, and hired a bugler to play &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; as he stepped out of his limo. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Trump&apos;s hat color signals his mood: &quot;If the cap was white, the staff noticed, the boss was in a good mood. If it was red, it was best to stay away.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Marjorie Merriweather Post, the cereal heiress who built the mansion 90 years ago, bent the nearby airport to her will, insuring that airplanes skirted around her property. Trump hasn&apos;t been able to swing the same privilege, and is currently suing the airport. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>There&apos;s a portrait of The Donald in the library-turned-bar at Mar-a-Lago, posing in tennis whites. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>On a recent Sunday afternoon, Trump passed through the living room on his way to the golf course, in front of Senecal and a reporter from the paper of record. The former called &quot;All rise!&quot; and everyone rose. </li>
</ul>

<p>Senecal also appeared on CNN last week to defend his employer, the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825153833/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/03/10/trump_butler_incredibly_generous_just_a_nice_man.html">incredibly generous person</a>,&quot;  but we&apos;d rather sign off with this flashback to 2013, when Trump was more amusing than threatening and Senecal was packing his suitcase for The Apprentice and not The White House.</p>
