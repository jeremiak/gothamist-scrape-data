<p>Veteran NYPD officer Masood Syed says that he was suspended without pay earlier this week after he refused to shave his beard to one millimeter&#x2014;even though he&apos;s maintained a longer beard for &quot;nearly all&quot; of his decade on the force. A practicing Muslim from Queens, Syed has filed a federal class-action lawsuit alleging that the NYPD&apos;s beard policy&#x2014;an amalgamation of guidebook rules and unwritten accommodations&#x2014;violates his Constitutional rights. </p>

<p>Former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180544/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/15/nypd_requires_c.php">revised the department&apos;s patrol guide</a> in 2008 to prohibit facial hair, making exceptions for undercover officers and&#x2014;on a case-by-case basis&#x2014;cops seeking religious or medical accommodation. Those exempt from the no-beard policy are often allowed facial hair up to one millimeter in length, according to the suit.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a bizarre thing where [officers] are limited to a beard of one millimeter by this unwritten policy,&quot; Syed&apos;s attorney Luna Droubi told us. &quot;If you&apos;re undercover and you want to fit in with a biker gang or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180544/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/03/nypd_spies_like_not_us.php">do Muslim surveillance</a>, that&apos;s fine. But if it&apos;s for a religious accommodation, that&apos;s not okay.&quot; </p>

<p>Captain James Kobel of the Equal Employment Opportunity office allegedly told Syed last summer that his beard was against policy, as it exceeded one millimeter (the equivalent of one day&apos;s stubble, according to Droubi). Syed refused, prompting a series of meetings with superiors. Syed made a formal exemption request in December&#x2014;maintaining his beard all the while&#x2014;and didn&apos;t hear anything more on the matter until this week, when Kobel gave him an ultimatum, according to the suit. </p>

<p>An emergency hearing was held in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180544/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/nyregion/muslim-officer-sues-new-york-police-dept-over-no-beard-policy.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;_r=0">the NY Times reports</a>. The NYPD has been ordered to keep paying Syed&#x2014;who&apos;s assigned to a unit that handles internal disciplinary proceedings&#x2014;until his next court date on July 8th. Ultimately, Syed hopes the suit will protect the rights of about 100 officers seeking religious accommodation. </p>

<p>In June 2013, a Hasidic police cadet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180544/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/09/hasidic_police_cadet_claims_nypd_fi.php">alleged</a> that he had been fired for refusing to shave his beard. Cadet Fishel Litzman sued the NYPD, and a judge found the policy in violation of the First Amendment. </p>

<p>The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However Lawrence Byrne, NYPD deputy commissioner for legal matters, told the NY Times that the beard policy was in accordance with federal guidelines for gas masks. &#x201C;We remain the No. 1 terrorist target in the world,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And we need to have all 36,000 of our officers able to respond.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But Droubi says that her client was certified to wear a gas mask, despite his beard. &quot;I can&apos;t speak to why they are suddenly making this a big deal,&quot; she said. &quot;But there&apos;s a lot of inherent discrimination that can be masked under words that sound neutral.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The NYPD in some ways represents the city, and it&apos;s not representing the city accurately if it&apos;s not allowing all of its Muslim, Sikh and Jewish officers to present their religious beliefs,&quot; she added.  </p>
