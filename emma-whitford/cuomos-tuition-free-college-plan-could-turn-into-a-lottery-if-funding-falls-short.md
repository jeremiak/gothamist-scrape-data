<p>Governor Cuomo&apos;s budget director confirmed Tuesday that CUNY and SUNY schools will have the option to award his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/03/cuomo_cuny_suny_tuition.php">new free tuition scholarship</a> by random lottery if demand exceeds supply. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s just in case, for some strange reason, there is not sufficient capacity with the appropriation,&quot; said budget director Robert Mujica. &quot;We think there is going to be plenty.&quot; </p>

<p>The relevant section of the bill reads [emphasis added]: </p>

<blockquote>The president <strong>may establish: (a) an application deadline and (b) a method of selecting recipients if in any given year there are insufficient funds to cover the needs of all  the applicants</strong> provided that priority shall be given to eligible applicants who are currently in attendance at a public institution of higher education.

<p>6. Rules and regulations. The corporation is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations, and may promulgate <strong>emergency regulations, necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this section including, but not limited to, the criteria for distributing the awards, which may include a lottery or other form of random selection.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Mujica added that similar language has been included in other scholarships, like the State&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/https://www.hesc.ny.gov/repay-your-loans/repayment-options-assistance/loan-forgiveness-cancellation-and-discharge/nys-get-on-your-feet-loan-forgiveness-program.html">Loan Forgiveness Program</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/nys-grants-scholarships-awards/nys-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics-stem-incentive-program/nys-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics-stem-incentive-program-faqs.html">STEM</a>. But student advocates at CUNY have countered that the provision is one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/10/tuition_free_college_cuomo.php">too many stipulations</a>. Eligible students must maintain a 3.0 GPA and complete 30 credits per year, and live and work in-state for at least two years after graduation (otherwise the grant converts to a loan). </p>

<p>&quot;The whole thing should have come with a &apos;while supplies last&apos; caveat,&quot; said Erik Forman, a current ESL teacher for CUNY and organizer with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/http://www.free-cuny.org/">a new campaign</a> to make CUNY entirely tuition-free. </p>

<p>The State has earmarked $87 million for the Excelsior Scholarship for the 2017-2018 school year, and plans to increase that investment to $163 million by year three. Full scholarships will be accessible to families making up to $100,000 annually in fall 2017, $110,000 annually in 2018, and $125,000 annually in 2019. </p>

<p>According to Mujica, the $87 million is expected to accommodate about 22,000 people in its first year across four-year and community colleges. That estimate assumes an average scholarship of $4,500 per year per student, and is based on a projection of the number of full-time students in the income bracket who meet all requirements. </p>

<p>Part-time students, who make up a sizable percentage of both two and four-year institutions, are excluded from the scholarship. At CUNY, 44 percent of 146,234 four-year students and 40 percent of  99,045 two-year students were part time in 2015. </p>

<p>A 2015 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/http://www.mdrc.org/news/press-release/new-study-shows-cuny-s-asap-program-nearly-doubles-three-year-graduation-rate">Independent Budget Office report</a> estimated that a free-tuition program for full-time students at CUNY Community Colleges alone would cost $138 million. Judith Scott-Clayton, a professor of economics and education at Teachers Colleges, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/https://www.brookings.edu/research/as-cuomo-proposal-rekindles-free-college-movement-new-research-provides-ammunition-for-skeptics/">predicted earlier this year</a> that Excelsior &quot;could easily cost two to four times&quot; the IBO estimate. </p>

<p>Sudents with Free CUNY also pointed to new tuition increases written into the budget, calling Excelsior a &quot;smokescreen.&quot; The budget includes an option for $200 increases per year at four-year CUNY and SUNY schools, for the next four years. These tuition increases would be contingent on Board of Trustee votes, a SUNY spokeswoman said; neither CUNY nor SUNY commented on whether they plan to instate the increases. </p>

<p>According to the Governor&apos;s Office, the State increased overall higher education funding by $448 million this fiscal year. Mujica also said that 180,000 low income students already receive free tuition at CUNY and SUNY, thanks to the state-funded Tuition Assistance Program. &quot;Tuition is only going to up only for those who are not eligible for TAP, and now Excelsior,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Spokespeople for both CUNY and SUNY stressed that the lottery would only kick in under certain circumstances. </p>

<p>&quot;We need to see how actual demand increases during the summer,&quot; said SUNY spokeswoman Holly Liapis. CUNY spokeswoman Emily Gest said that the language is conditional, and not a requirement. </p>

<p>Melinda Karp, assistant director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420020509/http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/">Community College Research Center</a> at Teachers College, said she was troubled by the lottery provision in the legislation, which would apply in &quot;any given year there are insufficient funds to cover the needs of all the applicants.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That to me reads as, &apos;If there is a budget crisis, or if more students apply, or if the cost is much larger than what the state is saying&apos;&#x2014;I read it as a way to say, &apos;We don&apos;t have to make everyone eligible a recipient,&quot; Karp said. <br>
