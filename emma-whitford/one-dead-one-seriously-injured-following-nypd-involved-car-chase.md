<p>One person was killed and another seriously injured in a car chase that ended in a crash in Queens on Thursday afternoon, the FDNY confirmed. According to social media reports, the NYPD was involved in the chase, and the driver of the pursued vehicle and a pedestrian were seriously injured.</p>

<p>Four other people have been transported to North Shore Hospital with minor injuries, according to the FDNY. </p>

<p>The NYPD could confirm only that the crash took place at 12:49 p.m. outside 225 Linden Boulevard, near the corner of 225th Street in Cambria Heights, and that officers are on the scene. </p>

<p>Witnesses say that an elderly woman was struck in the crash. </p>

<p>&quot;Shit crazy man,&quot; said Instagram user <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122720/https://www.instagram.com/b_loyalrdietryin/">Bern Franlkin</a> in a short video from the scene. &quot;Lady just lost her life right here on Linden and 225th. Police was chasing down somebody.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now they trying to hide the lady body with that NYPD barricade,&quot; Franlkin added in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122720/https://www.instagram.com/p/BHkfzCFBeHU/?taken-by=b_loyalrdietryin">second video</a>, which shows the barricade. &quot;NYPD a fuckin&apos; bitch, man. You&apos;re supposed to know when to chase somebody when to ease up, man.&quot; </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122720/https://www.facebook.com/RiiqueBossin/videos/vb.100001524576772/1129841767076632/?type=2&amp;theater">Facebook post</a> and accompanying video, witness Ty. B Kapone writes that police officers were chasing a driver, who in turn struck an elderly woman at the intersection of Linden and 225th. According to Kapone&apos;s account, officers on the scene did not immediately go to the pedestrian&apos;s aide. Here&apos;s the post in full: </p>

<blockquote>
Bad Footage But These NYPD Officers Are Crazy .. They Were Chasing A Man In His Car , As He Came Accross The Intersection An Old Lady Crashed Into Him .. They Were So Worried About Getting Him Out Of The Car &amp; Or Killing Him , Not One Cop Tended To The Lady To Try &amp; Resuscitate Her . The Old Lady Is On The Ground Behind All Of This Bleeding To Death . After The Man Is Arrested &amp; Put In The Squad Car They Rush Over &amp; Act Like They Where Trying To Help Her But It Was Too Late ... &#x1F621; &#x202A;#&#x200E;FUCKNYPD&#x202C; For Real &#x203C;&#xFE0F; &#x1F4AF;</blockquote>

<p>In the video Kapone can be heard saying, &quot;They [cops] was ready to shoot him before he... before they even got him out the whip. How you gonna shoot him he isn&apos;t even out the car yet?&quot; His footage shows an unmarked NYPD vehicle on the scene with lights flashing, although it&apos;s not clear if the vehicle was involved in the crash. </p>

<p>We will update as more information becomes available.</p>
