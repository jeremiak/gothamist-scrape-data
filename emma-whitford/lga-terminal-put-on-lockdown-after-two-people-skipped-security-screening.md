title: LGA Terminal Put On Lockdown After Two People Skipped Security Screening
---

	
										<p>A JetBlue security checkpoint at LaGuardia Airport&apos;s Terminal B was on lockdown for about 20 minutes this morning after two people wandered through a designated exit into the terminal, completely bypassing security, according to the TSA. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the TSA said that two people passed by clearly-marked signage indicating that the area was off limits and ended up in the terminal stairwell area that&apos;s meant for people who have already been screened. Both people&#x2014;the TSA couldn&apos;t confirm age or gender&#x2014;were apparently rushed out of the typically-secure area within 20 seconds. </p>

<p>The incident took place around 8:45 this morning and though the actual breach was brief, TSA says it took until about 9:15 to get security lines moving again&#x2014;plenty of time for a sizeable passenger backlog to form. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, travelers cheering for the Olympics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022065304/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/jfk_airport_evacuation.php">prompted a false-alarm active shooter threat</a> at JFK Airport. Two terminals were evacuated, and Governor Cuomo subsequently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022065304/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/17/cuomo_jfk_airport_probe.php">ordered an interdepartmental review</a> of how the Port Authority responds to threats and security breaches.  </p>
