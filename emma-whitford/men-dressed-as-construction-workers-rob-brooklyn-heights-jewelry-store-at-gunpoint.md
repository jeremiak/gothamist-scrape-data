<p>Three men disguised as construction workers in hard hats and orange vests assaulted a Brooklyn Heights jewelry store owner on Thursday evening before making off with jewelry and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>Police from the 84th Precinct responded to a call of a robbery in progress at Court Street Jewelers near Joralemon Street just after 5:30 p.m., a spokesman said. Upon arrival, they encountered the store&apos;s 67-year-old owner with a laceration to the head. Four men had already fled into the Borough Hall subway station, according to the NYPD, making off with $250,000 in cash and &quot;half a million&quot; in jewelry. </p>

<p>Three suspects allegedly entered the store after 5:00 p.m. and displayed a handgun before assaulting the owner, according to the NYPD. A fourth suspect wearing a Tyvek suit allegedly stood guard outside the store, holding an umbrella and a sign that read &quot;Danger Asbestos&#x2014;Men Working.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He had his head bashed open,&quot; one witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709020138/http://nypost.com/2017/05/25/armed-robbers-swipe-800k-in-jewels-and-cash-in-rush-hour-heist/">told the NY Post</a>, referring to the shop owner. &quot;He was like running around screaming: &#x2018;Help me, help me.&#x2019; A lot of people were calling the cops&#x2014;it was really crazy.&quot; </p>

<p>Photos from the scene show the shop owner on a stretcher, his face bloodied. He &#x201C;was chasing the person who robbed him around [the block],&quot; another witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709020138/https://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2017/5/25/shopkeeper-injured-violent-jewelry-store-robbery-court-street-brooklyn-heights">told the Brooklyn Daily Eagle</a>. </p>
