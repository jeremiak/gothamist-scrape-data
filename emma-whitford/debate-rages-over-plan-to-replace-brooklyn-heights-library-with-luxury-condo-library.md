<p>&quot;I think this is the most controversial issue that I&apos;ve seen in my district since being elected in 2009,&quot; said Councilmember Stephen Levin at a hearing that dragged on for more than four hours on Wednesday. All told, 85 constituents testified for or against a proposal to demolish the aging and low-ceilinged Brooklyn Heights branch of the Brooklyn Public Library and replace it with a with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/16/brooklyn_heights_library.php">36-story luxury condominium</a>. </p>

<p>As part of the $52 million proposal, developer Hudson Properties would construct a public library branch on the first floor of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/http://280cadman.com/">tower at 280 Cadman Plaza West</a>, with an estimated completion date of 2020. </p>

<p>Three hours into the debate, Levin spoke up again. &quot;People,&quot; he said, &quot;please behave.&quot; </p>

<p>Already, Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce President Carlo Scissura had dubbed the project &quot;truly innovative&quot; and even &quot;something revolutionary&quot;; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/http://www.commoncause.org/">Common Cause</a> Policy Manager Prudence Katze had deemed it &quot;relatively hasty and uncreative,&quot; setting &quot;a dangerous precedent for plugging budget holes&quot; by nullifying a public asset; Union coalition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/http://www.buildupnyc.org/">Build Up NYC</a> had condemned Hudson&apos;s refusal to mandate union construction labor. </p>

<p>&quot;This is not a dilapidated library,&quot; said one neighbor, defending the existing structure. Another insisted that, &quot;The library is a dark place, a dirty place. Hot in the summer and cold in the winter.&quot; </p>

<p>Brooklyn Height&apos;s Community Board 2 and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/11/03/city_planning_greenlights_controversial_brooklyn_library_project.php">City Planning commission</a> have both approved the Hudson plan, which also mandates that the developer supplement its luxury units with 114 units of affordable housing at an offsite location in neighboring Clinton Hill. </p>

<p>These units will take applicants who earn between 60-165% of the Area Median Income&#x2014;for a family of two, that means household incomes ranging from $41,424 to $113,916. Rents for two-bedrooms will range from $1,106 to $3,135. According to the 2013 census, around 36.3% of New York households make less than $35,000 a year, and 47.8% make less than $50,000.</p>

<p>This &quot;affordable&quot; housing, with an estimated completion date of 2018, has done little to appease many Brooklyn Heights residents, who argue that their neighborhood is already feeling the strain of steady high-rise development from the Heights to nearby DUMBO and Vinegar Hill. </p>

<p>Last fall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/realestate/transforming-a-brooklyn-neighborhood-with-new-condos.html?_r=1">the NY Times reported</a> that about half a dozen residential developments are projected to add between 1,500 and 2,000 people to DUMBO in the next few years. PS 8, which serves Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/22/dumbo_school_rezoning_fight.php">in the midst of a contentious rezoning battle</a> with the Department of Education, and is at 140% capacity. </p>

<p>&quot;What is Brooklyn Heights getting by this sale? A new high rise,&quot; testified retired librarian Daniel Winicore. &quot;It will not be getting any new affordable housing.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="071615currentBPL.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/071615currentBPL.jpeg" width="640" height="448"> <br> <i>The Brooklyn Heights Library at 280 Cadman Plaza West (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brooklyn_Public_Library_branches">via</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Hudson Properties Principal David Kramer did his best to get the hearing&apos;s attendees on board with the plan. Because he lives &quot;blocks from the site,&quot; he said, the project is &quot;very personal.&quot; Kramer described two &quot;micro-retail&quot; spaces that would join the library on the tower&apos;s first floor&#x2014;Brooklyn Coffee Roasters (&quot;so people can get the necessary caffeination&quot;) and a &quot;curated pop-up retail space&quot; with a weekly rotation of Smorgasburg vendors. </p>

<p>Brooklyn Library President Linda Johnson also defended the plan, describing a new library branch that will be &quot;modern and inviting&quot; for people to work &quot;collaboratively&quot; in.</p>

<p>Primarily, though, she focused on a Brooklyn library system that is experiencing a &quot;maintenance crisis.&quot; The entire system has an estimated $300 million in unfunded capital needs; 70% of the libraries in the system are more than 50 years old, and a quarter of them need $5 million in maintenance. The Brooklyn Heights branch, which was built in 1962 (she described it as &quot;outdated and outmoded&quot;) needs about $9 million. The city only provides the BPL with $15 million annually in capital funds. </p>

<p>Johnson also argued that the new proposed library would total 18,500 square feet of public space, &quot;more than any other Brooklyn branch.&quot; (The library facing demolishment totals 19,000 square feet of public space, plus a 16,400-square-foot Business and Careers library.) $40 million from the sale would go towards renovating public libraries in Bushwick, Fort Greene and Boerum Hill, and an $8-million, brand new library in Sunset Park.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to quote from our spiritual forefather K. Marx, who said &apos;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&apos; and thats what this is really about,&quot; said former District 15 CEC President Jim Devore. &quot;To the extent that this will redistribute wealth from Downtown Brooklyn to other parts of Brooklyn, it&apos;s important and it&apos;s necessary.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="071615libraryrendering.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002203im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/071615libraryrendering.jpeg" width="640" height="399"> <br> <i>This is what a library inside of a condo might look like (Marvel Architects)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Councilmember Levin was less sure. &quot;In doing this you&apos;re taking away something from an area that has a lot of traffic,&quot; he said. &quot;My concern is that this is removing a resource from Downtown Brooklyn.&quot; </p>

<p>Earlier, Kramer had presented a rendering of the 7,000-square-foot interim library that would operate out of Our Lady of Lebanon Church on nearby Remsen Street for the duration of construction. &quot;It beats a book mobile,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;It beats no service at all.&quot; </p>

<p>The City Council is scheduled to vote on the proposal before the end of 2016. </p>
