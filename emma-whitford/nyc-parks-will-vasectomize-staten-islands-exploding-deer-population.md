<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of deer on Staten Island. So many, that Borough President James Oddo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/23/staten_island_rejects_hipster_deer.php">took personal offense</a> when two of them were unceremoniously dumped on his soil last fall. &quot;We already have an exploding deer population approaching crisis proportions, and to release more deer into this overcrowded herd is unconscionable,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>A 2014 study counted 763 deer total on the island. That comes out to about 42 deer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/10/22/staten-island-a-deer-dumping-ground-one-official-speaks-out/">per square mile</a>. </p>

<p>To combat the crisis, NYC Parks today announced plans to vasectomize every single male deer as soon as this coming fall, assuming the State&apos;s approval. The surgical approach to crowd control would be carried out over three years, and is expected to reduce the borough&apos;s herd by between 10-30%. </p>

<p>As recently as 2008, there were only 24 deer in the entire borough. Experts say the population exploded from just a handful&#x2014;&quot;presumed to have swum from New Jersey,&quot; according to the City&#x2014;in part because Staten Island doesn&apos;t harbor any deer predators. </p>

<p>And as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/05/deer_caught_head_light.php">benign and bumbling</a> as they may seem, deer can wreck havoc. Not only do they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20151113/willowbrook/city-install-deer-crossing-signs-on-staten-island">get in the way of cars</a>&#x2014;the Advance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/sterilize_staten_island_deer.html">reports</a> that there were 40 deer collisions on Staten Island last year&#x2014;but they&apos;ve been known to spread tick-borne illnesses like lyme disease, and stilt tree growth. </p>

<p>Parks also plans to install new fencing around Staten Island forest land, and launch a public awareness campaign about health risks associated with tics, as well as safe driving practices on deer-heavy roadways. </p>

<p>As recently as March, Mayor de Blasio had not ruled out the possibility of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/de_blasio_wont_rule_out_killin.html">population control by poison</a>, rather than sterilization. The lethal approach has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://www.nyclass.org/savethedeer">strongly opposed</a> by the developer-backed anti-horse-carriage-industry group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://www.nyclass.org/splash?splash=1">New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets (NYCLASS)</a>, which donated $100,000 to Mayor de Blasio&apos;s now-disbanded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/22/de_blasio_shadow_govmnt.php">Campaign For One New York</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/22/nyclass_subpoenaed.php">was recently subpoenaed</a>. </p>

<p>The connection didn&apos;t get past reporters at a tense media availability this afternoon, where the mayor took questions about his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006141716/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/09/de_blasio_fund-raising_corruption.php">recently-scrutinized</a> fundraising efforts. </p>

<p>&quot;It [vasectomy] is a smart plan,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;It&apos;s very consistent with the most modern, humane treatment of animals.&quot;</p>
