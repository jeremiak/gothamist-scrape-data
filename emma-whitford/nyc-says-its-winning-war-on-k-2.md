<p>Last September, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/nyregion/k2-a-potent-drug-casts-a-shadow-over-an-east-harlem-block.html">declared</a> East Harlem the &quot;epicenter&quot; of NYC&apos;s K2 crisis, following a frenzy of tabloid reportage on the sale and abuse of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/tags/k2">the drug</a>: a highly-addictive and inexpensive mixture of potpourri and chemicals that, until recently, was sold freely behind the counter at neighborhood bodegas. </p>

<p>Today, she and Mayor de Blasio, along with representatives from this City&apos;s Health Department, declared that crisis essentially squashed. &quot;This harmful drug has no place on our streets,&quot; Mark-Viverito stated. &quot;I thank the City for working with us to end the K2 epidemic.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the Mayor&apos;s office, K2-related hospitalizations have decreased 85% since July 2015, when the City took the drug to task&#x2014;from 1,200 cases at peak to about 180 this March. </p>

<center><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <div class="image-none"> <img alt="050316_K2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/050316_K2.jpeg" width="600" height="311"> <br> <i> (via Mayor&apos;s Office). </i></div></span></center>

<p>Sold alternatively as spice, rocks and AK-47 (according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/media/k2-campaign.page">one poster</a> designed by the City), K2 is a mixture of chemical-sprayed leaves, often imported from China. It&apos;s been linked to strokes and erratic behavior, and has been ruled the cause of at least one death in NYC. </p>

<p>The war against K2, punctuated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opPyEEGAg30">PSAs</a> and press conferences, has been lengthy. The drug solicited an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/18/160_new_yorkers_hospitalized_over_f.php">early warning</a> from Governor Cuomo last April, after 160 people were hospitalized for likely overdoses in a single month. Since then, the Feds have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/16/k2_bust_nyc.php">detailed how the stuff gets made</a>, and lifted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/24/k2_10_million_nyc.php">2 million packets</a> from a Bronx garage in one go. A former K2 addict came forward to recount her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/25/k2_crackdown_smoke_parties.php">smoke parties</a>, and some level-headed City Council members suggested that people might stop smoking fake, deadly &quot;synthetic marijuana&quot; if the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/21/k2_or_weed_nyc.php">real thing</a> were simply decriminalized (we&apos;re still waiting for the final word on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/09/brooklyn_pot_decriminalize.php">that one</a>). </p>

<p>Sale and production of the drug was ultimately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/k2_synthetic_marijuana_illegal.php">criminalized in October</a>, but not before the City deemed it &quot;weaponized,&quot; and blasted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/04/video_nypd_says_synthetic_weaponize.php">demonstrative video</a> of a naked man tearing through a fence with his bare hands, which turned out to be clipped from an episode of COPS shot in Des Moines, depicting the effects of PCP (a discrepancy the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/04/video_nypd_says_synthetic_weaponize.php">later defended</a>). </p>

<p>&quot;The City remains committed to eliminating any remnants of K2 sales,&quot; said Elizabeth Glazer, director of the Mayor&apos;s Criminal Justice office, on Tuesday. In the meantime, the logical conclusion of all this reminiscing is this last, sweet reminder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813154521/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/fake_weed_taste_test.php#photo-1">simpler times</a>. </p>
