<p>Hundreds of airport workers are protesting at LaGuardia&apos;s Terminal B this afternoon to push the Port Authority&apos;s hand on a living wage and benefits. Several workers were arrested outside the terminal entrance around 12:45 p.m., according to participants. Exact numbers were not immediately available.  </p>

<p>Today&apos;s planned civil disobedience coincides with actions at 10 major airports across the country, including Boston, Chicago and Miami. Martin Luther King Jr. Day has been NYC airport workers&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://www.seiu32bj.org/spotlights/mlk-our-day/">only paid holiday</a> since January 2014, freeing up many of today&apos;s participants to march over the 94th Street Bridge. </p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s what MLK fought for&#x2014;justice, equality and a non-violent movement,&quot; said Jean Timmer, 42, a Jet Blue cabin cleaner for going-on five months. With a living wage of $15/hr, Timmer says he could help send his 23-year-old daughter to college to pursue fashion. </p>

<p>Timmer, who lives in Brooklyn, currently makes the Port Authority-mandated minimum of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=1966">$10.10/hr</a>. His job entails cleaning airplane seat cushions and bathrooms, where he regularly encounters bodily fluids like saliva to vomit.</p>

<p>The timing of today&apos;s action is deliberate. Organizers pointed out that King <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/08/28/2539901/unfulfilled-demand-march-washington-15-minimum-wage/">demanded a $2/hr minimum wage</a> at the 1963 march on Washington. Adjusted for inflation with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">BLS calculator</a>, that comes to $15.51/hr in 2015. </p>

<p>Airport terminal and cabin cleaners have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/17/jetblue_plane_cleaners_rights.php">long alleged</a> that Roma and Ultimate Aircraft, JetBlue&apos;s non-union cleaning service subcontractors, fail to supply their employees with sanitary gloves or goggles to clean airport bathrooms and airplane galleys, and distribute unmarked cleaning chemicals. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="011816_JFK2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/011816_JFK2.jpg" width="240" height="320"> <br> <i style=" width:240px; ;display:block"> (via SEIU 32BJ)</i></div> Today&apos;s action is the latest in a two-year-long effort to raise wages and secure benefits at airports nationwide. In January 2014, cabin cleaners, bag haulers, and other minimum wage airport employees&#x2014;all employed by subcontractors&#x2014;rallied outside of Port Authority, demanding a living wage, in addition to vacation days and health benefits. Later that month, 32 protestors were arrested outside of LaGuardia while rallying for similar benefits.<p></p>

<p>JFK and LaGuardia workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/strike_4.php">launched a 24-hour strike</a> in mid-November 2015, and a 24-hour hunger strike on the eve of Thanksgiving. </p>

<p>Last fall&apos;s actions coincided with the resignation of former Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye. Foye voiced his support for a $15/hr minimum wage at the end of his tenure, and had support from several Port Authority board members, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/nyregion/port-authority-leader-to-quit-as-ceo-search-drags-on.html">according to the NY Times</a>. But Board Chairman John Degnan opposed the move, stating that the Port Authority is &quot;not a social welfare agency.&quot;</p>

<p>The authority is in the midst of planning several expensive projects, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/laguardia_reboot_ferry.php">$4 billion</a> overhaul for LaGuardia, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/15/hudson_rail_tunnel_obama.php">new tunnel</a> under the Hudson River. </p>

<p>&quot;The Board sounded off but didn&apos;t take any action,&quot; said Amity Paye, a spokeswoman for the service workers union SEIU 32BJ, which organized today&apos;s march. &quot;So airport workers are still waiting.&quot; </p>

<p>Governor Cuomo endorsed an industry-wide $15 minimum wage in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628061858/http://m.nydailynews.com/news/politics/cuomo-airport-workers-deserve-boost-minimum-wage-article-1.2499905">op-ed</a> published in the Daily News on Sunday. &quot;By raising the minimum wage for airport workers, we can put thousands of families on the path to financial independence and a brighter future,&quot; he wrote. </p>

<p>The Port Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We will update with any additional information. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There have been 25 arrests at LGA this afternoon, according to a spokeswoman for the union. Among the arrestees are three elected officials: Councilmember Corey Johnson, State Assemblyman Keith Wright, and Councilmember Mark Levine. </p>
