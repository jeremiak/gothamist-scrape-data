<p>A police officer fired his gun at three people inside a stairwell in a Queens housing project on Wednesday night, according to the NYPD. Two of the group were holding fake guns, which were later recovered from the scene. The gunshot did not strike anyone, and two people fled after it was fired. </p>

<p>The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314040328/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-officer-fires-suspect-aimed-toy-gun-police-article-1.2974002">reports</a> that the third person in the stairwell, a 15-year-old boy, was detained. A spokeswoman for the NYPD declined to confirm his age, as he hadn&apos;t yet been charged. </p>

<p>Police responded to the second floor stairwell of 106-35 159th Street in the South Jamaica Houses shortly before 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday. The NYPD says the officers were responding to reports of three males fighting and using drugs there. Upon arrival, cops allegedly came across the group, two of whom were holding fake guns. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the officers then took out their firearms and instructed the group not to move. One person allegedly &quot;turned towards the officers while still holding a firearm,&quot; according to a release from the department. One of the officers then fired his gun. </p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing as of Thursday morning. </p>

<p>In November 2014, former NYPD officer Peter Liang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314040328/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/pink_houses_nycha_gurley.php">fatally shot 28-year-old Akai Gurley</a> in a darkened stairwell at the NYCHA-run Pink Houses in East New York. Liang was convicted of manslaughter last year, but that charge was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314040328/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/nypd_cop_sentencing_gurley.php">ultimately dropped</a> by Brooklyn judge Danny Chun, who ruled that there was &quot;no evidence that Liang was aware of Gurley and still fired the gun.&quot;</p>
