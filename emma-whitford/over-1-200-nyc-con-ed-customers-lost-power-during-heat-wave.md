<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090017/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/06/swampy_hotbox_deadass.php">first heat wave of the summer</a> coincided conveniently with power outages in Brooklyn and Queens on Wednesday, leaving more than 1,200 customers in the dark across Bushwick, Flushing, Astoria, Long Island City and Jamaica. </p>

<p>In Bushwick, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090017/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/06/heat-power-outages/">CBS reports</a> that an outage at Knickerbocker and DeKalb Avenues knocked out street lights, prompting cops to direct traffic. </p>

<p>Con Ed crews are still at work making repairs this afternoon, and the company has identified 213 customers still in the dark, down from yesterday&apos;s peak of 1,224. Thirty-six of those unlucky customers live in Flushing, according to Con Ed&apos;s outage map, 22 in Jamaica, and 121 in Long Island City. The rest are scattered around Queens and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Con Ed spokesman Sidney Alzarez said on Thursday that he strongly doubted the outages were heat related. &quot;We <em>are</em> experiencing some hot temperatures right now, but to call these heat related&#x2014;it&apos;s not likely,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve had, in the past, higher temps that we&apos;ve had to deal with. In a nutshell, we have what&apos;s called a &apos;peak load demand,&apos; and we haven&apos;t reached that at all.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Having 1,200 customers out is not an unusual situation,&quot; he added, hedging quickly that, &quot;we don&apos;t want anyone to be out. But this isn&apos;t a very high number at all. We&apos;ve had thousands out.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090017/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/20/power_outage_nyc.php">True</a>. </p>

<p>So what <em>did</em> cause hundreds of people to kick their air conditioners yesterday? In Astoria, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090017/http://abc7ny.com/weather/power-outage-in-astoria-leaves-residents-in-the-dark/1416803/">ABC reports</a>, a manhole issue on 44th Street and Broadway left 100 people without service. And in Flushing, a manhole fire at Prince Street and Roosevelt Avenue impacted the NYCHA-run Bland Houses. </p>

<p>Alzarez said that both Brooklyn and Queens are supplied by overhead and underground Con Ed systems. The latter, to hear him tell it, are constantly at risk of being compromised. &quot;There could be many factors why the cable burned out,&quot; he said. &quot;During the winter when the city puts salt in the road, the salt gets into our system, and it&apos;s highly corrosive. Then there could be regular wear or tear on the cables, or rats chewing the cables, or vibrations from the subways disrupting the cables. Then there&apos;s also the heat factor.&quot; </p>

<p>Even if this week&apos;s outages can&apos;t be chalked up to heat unequivocally, today&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090017/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/07/also_locusts.php">lovely weather</a> won&apos;t help. Con Ed has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090017/http://coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20160705.asp">some tips for you</a> on that front. </p>

<p>Alzarez also cautioned that the storms on tap for later today could compromise overhead wires. </p>

<p>For now, if you&apos;re among the unlucky ones still in the dark, Con Ed&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014090017/http://apps.coned.com/stormcenter_external/default.html">outage map</a> updates every 15 minutes with estimated power restoration times. </p>
