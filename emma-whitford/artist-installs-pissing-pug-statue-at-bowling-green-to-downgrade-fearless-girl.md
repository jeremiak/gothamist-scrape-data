<p>A NYC-based artist installed a small statue of a dog lifting its leg to &quot;piss&quot; on the Fearless Girl statue over Memorial Day weekend, successfully prolonging a months-long <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://gothamist.com/tags/fearlessgirl">debate</a> over the corporate-sponsored artwork&apos;s feminist messaging. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://gardegafineart.squarespace.com/">Alex Gardega&apos;s</a> &quot;Pissing Pug&quot; drew attention from passersby at Bowling Green on Monday, but by Tuesday it had already been removed from its Wall Street post. <strong>[See below for update.]</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;This is corporate nonsense,&quot; Gardega <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://nypost.com/2017/05/29/pissed-off-artist-adds-statue-of-urinating-dog-next-to-fearless-girl/">told the NY Post</a>, referring to Fearless Girl. &#x201C;It has nothing to do with feminism, and it is disrespect to the artist that made the bull.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I decided to build this dog and make it crappy to downgrade the statue, exactly how the girl is a downgrade on the bull,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>The 48-year-old Upper East Side artist told the tabloid that he is &quot;pro-feminism&quot;&#x2014;a message that was lost on some. </p>

<p>Multi-trillion asset manager State Street Global Advisors and New York advertising firm McCann are behind artist Kristen Visbal&apos;s Fearless Girl installation, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/https://www.instagram.com/p/BRmrJtOg0RH/">appeared across from sculptor Arturo Di Modica&apos;s Charging Bull</a> in early March accompanied by a plaque advertising State Street. A flood of empowering selfies ensued, while critics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/too-bad-that-statue-of-a-girl-staring-down-the-wall-street-bull-is-a-pr-stunt-by-wall-street-patriarchs-9749317">dismissed as toothless</a> any rebuke of Wall Street sponsored by Wall Street itself.</p>

<p>State Street, which currently has three women on its 11-person board, coincided the Fearless Girl launch with a new push to invest in companies with women board members. </p>

<p>&quot;Today, we are calling on companies to take concrete steps to increase gender diversity on their boards and have issued clear guidance to help them begin to take action,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://fortune.com/2017/03/07/money-manager-gender-equality/">said</a> Ron O&apos;Hanley, CEO of State Street, at the time. </p>

<p>&quot;We collaborated to conceive of this powerful symbol with universal appeal that is strong, yet not confrontational,&quot; Visbal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/07/fearless_girls_interview.php#photo-1">told Gothamist</a> in a recent interview. </p>

<p>Di Modica installed his bull statue outside the New York Stock Exchange without permission in 1989, and has bemoaned Fearless Girl since she appeared. He and his attorney, Normal Siegal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/12/fearless_girl_charging_bull.php">argue</a> that SSGA and city officials violated Di Modica&apos;s copyright on the bull by incorporating his art in the Fearless Girl installation without permission. </p>

<p>&quot;The message [of the bull] is for freedom in the world, peace, strength, power and love,&quot; Di Modica told reporters last Month. &quot;It&apos;s a negative now. The girl is right in front saying, &apos;Now I&apos;m here, what are you gonna do?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/12/fearless_girl_charging_bull.php">agreed to let Fearless Girl stand</a> at least through February 2018.</p>

<p>Gardega did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. </p>

<p><strong>[Update 11:00 a.m.]:</strong> Gardega told Gothamist by phone that he removed the statue himself on Monday afternoon, a few hours after the 9:00 a.m. installation. The paper mache statue, spray-painted bronze, cost $35 to make and was placed next to Fearless Girl, not bolted to the ground, according to the artist. </p>

<p>&quot;There were a few people who got really upset by it,&quot; Gardega said. &quot;A few people kicked it. One girl tried to throw it. I made the decision to take it away. I still have it. I&apos;m fixing its broken leg right now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I wanted it to be, like, punk rock lo-fi as a statement,&quot; he added. As for Fearless Girl&apos;s proximity to the Charging Bull, &quot;It&apos;s kind of like sticking something in front of Michelangelo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://www.accademia.org/explore-museum/artworks/michelangelos-david/">David</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>Gardega also insisted that he dislikes the statue because of its corporate sponsorship. &quot;I would respect this if it was done by a random artist standing up against Wall Street,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I&apos;m a very positive person actually, and I don&apos;t like to see people get upset.&quot; </p>

<p>Gardega is planning to bring his statue back to the Fearless Girl site in the near future, he said, and eventually sell it for $10 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174240/http://10dollarart.blogspot.com/">on his website</a>. One person offered $1,000 for it, which he declined, he said. </p>

<p>&quot;I am going to make a bunch of pissing puppies,&quot; Gardega added. &quot;They are going to be [sprayed with] gold paint. I&apos;m going to stick puppies around Manhattan for free.&quot; </p>
