<p>Around 4:00 p.m. on Monday, after nearly three full days of My Little Pony-themed activities&#x2014;pony drawing, pony yoga, pony character development, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011621/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/15/photos_ponycon_brooklyn.php">pony fashion show</a>, pony feminism&#x2014;the hardest thing to pick out among the marble busts, gilded oil paintings and gold-leaf banisters of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011621/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/grand_prospect_hall_tour.php">Grand Prospect Hall in Park Slope</a> was the slightest trace of irony. <br>
 <br>
Instead, teenage girls, cosplaying men in their 20s, one Park Slope dad with a baby strapped to his chest, a woman who discovered My Little Pony while recovering from a traumatic head injury, and a couple that has been inseparable since they met at a My Little Pony conference four years ago all expressed more-or-less the same sentiment: that a small herd of colorful ponies conceived in the 1980s and revamped in the aughts can help you obliterate daily challenges, lift you out of depression, and remind you that friendship is, well, magic&#x2014;or something.</p>

<p>At Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011621/http://ponycon.nyc/">fourth annual Ponycon</a>&#x2014;the first to be hosted at the Grand Prospect Hall&#x2014;attendees had a wide range of inundation stories. Fans in their 30s recalled G1, or the first &quot;generation&quot; of ponies, which had their own show in 1986 (<em>My Little Pony</em>) based on the Hasbro toys. The 2010 reboot, <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>, is primarily responsible for the strange mashup of nostalgic adults (mostly women who watched the show thirty years ago), cartoon-watching small children (mostly girls), and the slippery-to-define bronies, which we learned are mostly men (but not necessarily), mostly appreciative of the hyper-optimism of the show (although you can be in it mostly to appreciate the animation skills, apparently), and sometimes favor costumes that can cost upwards of a grand. </p>

<p>All told, a 19th century &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011621/http://www.grandprospect.com/ageofopulence2.html">playground for the rich</a>&quot; is a more fitting backdrop for earnest cosplay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011621/http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0LEVkBCZMNWIh4AksMnnIlQ;_ylu=X3oDMTEyaHZqdG1nBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDQjE1OTJfMQRzZWMDc3I-/RV=2/RE=1455674563/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fgothamist.com%2f2015%2f10%2f11%2fphotos_comic_con_invades_the_glowin.php/RK=0/RS=lulvSSVcHrrBztF500t24jXBbEk-">than the Javits Center</a>. </p>
