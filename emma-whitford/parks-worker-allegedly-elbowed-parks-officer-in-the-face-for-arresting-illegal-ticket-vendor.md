<p>A 53-year-old Parks Department employee was arrested and temporarily suspended on Wednesday, after she allegedly shoved and elbowed a group of parks enforcement patrol (PEP) officers while they attempted to arrest a man who was illegally selling sight-seeing tickets to tourists. </p>

<p>PEP officers encountered 36-year-old Royan Mitchell around 1:45 on Wednesday, attempting to sell tickets to the Hornblower Cruises at Pier 15 at the South Street Seaport. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060946/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2015/11/parks-worker-assaults-park-officer-over.html">According to A Walk in the Park</a>, Mitchell had been observed in the same act, at the same location, on November 11th. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="112715_Sandra2.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060946im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/112715_Sandra2.png" width="300" height="536"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Knight (via NYC Parks Advocates). </i></div> When the officers approached Mitchell, six Parks maintenance workers from Pier 15 stepped up and surrounded them, attempting to prevent them from carrying out the arrest.<p></p>

<p>&quot;They were cursing at us, and trying to prevent him from being locked up,&quot; one officer told A Walk in the Park. &quot;They were acting like animals.&quot; </p>

<p>Pier 15 maintenance worker Sandra Knight, 53, was particularly assertive, allegedly pushing the officers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060946/http://nypost.com/2015/11/27/ticket-peddling-parks-staffers-arrest-sparks-brawl/">According to the Post</a>, she elbowed PEP officer Ingrid Sanchez hard enough in the face to break her glasses. The officers eventually managed to arrest Mitchell. </p>

<p>Video posted on A Walk in the Park shows Mitchell handcuffed on the ground while Knight pushes forward yelling, &quot;You got me, you got me!&quot; As Knight continues to push forward, the officers tell her that she is under arrest. </p>

<p>Her colleagues can be heard shouting, &quot;Don&apos;t do it Sandra!&quot;</p>

<p>Mitchell, who refused to present ID, was ultimately charged with violation of local law, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. NYPD sources told the Post that he resisted by &quot;flailing his arms and attempting to run.&quot; </p>

<p>Knight, meanwhile, was issued criminal summonses for disorderly conduct, failure to comply with directives of officers, and obstruction of government administration. Namshik Yoon, Parks&apos; Chief of Operations, reportedly went to the 1st Precinct to speak on Knight&apos;s behalf, and managed to have her charges downgraded. </p>

<p>It was not immediately clear why Knight attempted to intervene in Mitchell&apos;s arrest. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the Parks Department would not comment on the incident, but confirmed that Knight had been issued a 30-day suspension. </p>
