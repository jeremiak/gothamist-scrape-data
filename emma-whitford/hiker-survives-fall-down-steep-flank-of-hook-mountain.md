<p>A hiker lost his footing and reportedly fell from a cliff down a steep flank of Hook Mountain in Nyack, New York on Monday afternoon and became wedged between a tree and the mountain face about 140 feet above sea level. </p>

<p>He managed to call for help on his cell phone while clinging to the tree, prompting a three hour rescue mission involving a stretcher and pulley system, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052221/http://abc7ny.com/news/hiker-used-cellphone-to-call-for-help-after-tumbling-down-getting-stuck-on-side-of-mountain/1130740/">according to ABC7</a>. </p>

<p>The man, who has yet to be identified by authorities, fell around 12:30 p.m., and was lowered to the ground around 4:00 p.m by local firefighters and police. He was treated for hypothermia and shock on the scene, and transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening hip and leg injuries.</p>

<p>&quot;He told them [the rescue team] he was tired and in pain,&quot; Gordon Wren, the county&apos;s emergency coordinator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052221/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2015/12/21/hook-mountain-rescue/77701342/">told the Journal News</a>. &quot;They said his speech was slurred. They estimated he was 140 to 150 feet above the river. He [had] no idea where he was.&quot;</p>

<p>Hook Mountain has the second-highest peak in the Palisades, over 700 feet above the Hudson.</p>
