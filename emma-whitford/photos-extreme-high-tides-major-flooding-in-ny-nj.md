										<p>The National Weather Service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214651/http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=OKX&amp;product=HWO">issued</a> a flooding advisory for coastal neighborhoods in NYC and Long Island this morning. Residents from Far Rockaway, Broad Chanel, Howard Beach and other waterfront neighborhoods are documenting flooding on city streets, in addition to snow flurries. </p>

<p>The Weather Service says that in addition to that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214651/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/snow_nyc_advisory_danger.php">winter weather advisory</a>, shore neighborhoods in Nassau and Suffolk counties, southern Westchester, and the Bronx were under advisory until 11:00 a.m, and will be again from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. tonight to coincide with the next high tide. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214651/http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/new-york-ny/10007/weather-warnings-1555408/349727">high-surf warning</a> is also in effect until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. </p>

<p>The tidal flooding is due in part to a coastal storm moving northward up the Atlantic today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214651/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Coastal-Storm-Moves-in-Tri-State-New-York-New-Jersey-Flooding-Howard-Beach-Snow-Hoboken-Union-368032901.html">NBC reports</a>. That storm is &quot;glancing&quot; the tri-state area, hence the high tides. The NJ Advance reports that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214651/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/1_to_4_inches_of_snow_forecast.html#incart_article_small">new moon</a> isn&apos;t helping.</p>

<p>Add to that the predicted snow flurries, and you&apos;ve got liquid precipitating above, and pooling below. </p>
