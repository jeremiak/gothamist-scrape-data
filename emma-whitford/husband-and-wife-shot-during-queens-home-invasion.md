<p>A State Corrections Department officer and his wife were shot in the entryway to their Jamaica, Queens home on Sunday night during an apparent home invasion. According to police, two men allegedly rang the front doorbell and burst through when Sharon Floyd-Wright, 52, answered. Her husband, 56-year-old Henry Wright, remains in critical condition. </p>

<p>Police responded to a call of two people shot at 163-72 Mathias Avenue on the corner of 166th Street just before 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. Upon arrival, they discovered Wright unconscious and unresponsive with multiple gunshot wounds to the torso. One or both of the suspects had allegedly shot him five times. Wright&apos;s wife had been shot once in the left shoulder. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151309/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/28/queens-home-invasion-suspects-sought/">According to CBS</a>, Floyd-Wright had already been shot when her husband came to her aid. &quot;Commotion in front of the house. Her husband came to see what happened and that&apos;s how he got shot,&quot; said a family friend who spoke to Floyd-Wright at Jamaica Hospital. </p>

<p>At one point during the encounter Floyd-Wright allegedly grabbed a hammer and managed to hit one of the suspects in the head, prompting them to flee west on Mathias Avenue. No arrests have been made as of Monday morning and an investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>The motive also remains unclear. An NYPD spokesman said that the men do not appear to have made off with any of the couple&apos;s possessions. </p>

<p>The suspects are both believed to be men in their 20s, according to the spokesman, and were last seen wearing blue jeans and black hoodies. </p>

<p>Wright works at Queensborough Correctional Facility in Long Island City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151309/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/correction-officer-shot-wounded-queens-home-invasion-article-1.2889239">according to the Daily News</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Everything was so quick,&quot; neighbor Mario Farez told the tabloid. &quot;They [first responders] just went inside and they just brought him back in the ambulance. He was in shorts. He didn&#x2019;t have a shirt on. He wasn&apos;t moving.&quot; </p>
