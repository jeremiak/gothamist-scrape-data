The law is now headed to Governor Andrew Cuomo&apos;s desk, where its approval is assured. <p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Repealing this regressive and unfair tax on women is a matter of social and economic justice,&quot; Cuomo said in a statement. &quot;I look forward to signing it into law.&quot;</p>

<p>Under current law, New York State exempts medical items from its sales tax, but excludes pads and tampons from the &quot;medical&quot; classification. According to the Department of Taxation&apos;s guide for retailers [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/publications/sales/pub840.pdf">PDF</a>], feminine hygiene products are &quot;generally used to control a normal bodily function and to maintain personal cleanliness.&quot; This differentiates them in the fine print from over-the-counter medication for a &quot;vaginal infection,&quot; which treats a &quot;specific medical condition.&quot; </p>

<p>Critics have called the state&apos;s 4% sales tax on tampons and other feminine hygiene products&#x2014;but not &quot;medical&quot; items like Rogaine, adult diapers and dandruff shampoo&#x2014;discriminatory and misogynistic, putting an outsized burden on low-income consumers. Earlier this year a group of women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/tampon_tax_lawsuit.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/https://www.tax.ny.gov/">New York State Department of Taxation and Finance</a>, arguing that the tax violates the Equal Protection clauses of the United States and New York State Constitutions.</p>

<p>&quot;This is one of many laws made by men and for men,&quot; said attorney Zoe Salzman at the time. &quot;If men menstruated once a month, there is no way there would be a sales tax on these products.&quot; </p>

<p>The bill also includes specific language exempting panty liners from the tax, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/http://divacup.com/">DivaCups</a> and period underwear (a product that&apos;s recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/subway_ads_mta.php">raised a few eyebrows in response to a subway ad campaign</a>). </p>

<p>&#x201C;It was very important that the bill language was broad enough to envisage new menstrual products,&#x201D; said bill sponsor Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal in a statement Wednesday. &#x201C;If and when the day comes that a new and improved menstrual technology hits the market, this law, once it is signed, will provide us with flexibility so that we don&#x2019;t have to go back in and amend the law to exempt each and every new product, that new product will simply be exempt.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The exemption will go into effect on September 1st, at which point New York State will finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tampon-tax-will-end-july-1-1.3091533?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2F2016%2F03%2F03%2Ftampon_tax_lawsuit.php&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click">be on par with Canada</a>. </p>

<p>In the meantime, Queens City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras would like NYC to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/10/free_tampons_for_everyone.php">take it a step further</a>, with free tampons for teen girls distributed in public schools. Twenty-five middle schools and high schools in the Bronx and Queens are already proving that this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104412/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/14/free_tampons_nyc_schools.php">can work</a>. </p>
