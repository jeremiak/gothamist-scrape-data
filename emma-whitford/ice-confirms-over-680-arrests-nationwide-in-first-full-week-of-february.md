										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="020817_Sanctuary.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415112912im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/020817_Sanctuary.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Scott Lynch / Gothamist) </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested a total of 41 people in the New York City metropolitan area during the first full week in February, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415112912/https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/statement-secretary-kelly-recent-ice-enforcement-actions">press release Monday afternoon</a>. Of that total, 38 people had prior criminal convictions. Three did not have criminal records. </p>

<p>The confirmation comes on the heels of an ICE memo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415112912/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/12/post_195.php">leaked over the weekend</a> that confirmed roughly 40 arrests in the NYC area. Today&apos;s extended press release does not confirm what neighborhoods the raids took place in, nor does it detail the criminal convictions of all of the individuals arrested. </p>

<p>Instead, ICE highlights three cases: a citizen of El Salvador with an assault conviction who, according to ICE, confirmed membership in the MS-13 gang; a Jamaican citizen convicted of first degree sexual assault of a minor under the age of 11; and a Mexican citizen with the same sexual assault conviction.</p>

<p>ICE also confirmed operations across the country last week, in the Los Angeles area, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Antonio, in addition to New York. In total the agency said &quot;more than 680&quot; arrests were made. Of that total, &quot;approximately 75 percent&quot; had criminal convictions. </p>

<p>By that calculation, roughly 170 individuals did not have criminal convictions. </p>

<p>&quot;ICE officers frequently encounter additional suspects [during an operation] who may be in the United States in violation of federal immigration laws,&quot; the agency stated in today&apos;s release. &quot;Those persons will be evaluated on a case by case basis and, when appropriate, arrested by ICE.&quot; </p>

<p>Immigration advocates and attorneys had hoped that ICE would provide more specifics on the convictions of those arrested in New York. President Obama, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415112912/http://blogs.reuters.com/data-dive/2015/02/25/tracking-obamas-deportation-numbers/">deported a record 400,000</a> people-plus annually early in his presidency, later narrowed ICE&apos;s focus to convicted felons&#x2014;individuals with charges similar to those outlined in today&apos;s release. But President Trump has indicated that his focus will be broader, including anyone who has committed an immigration violation&#x2014;those who are undocumented, have an open deportation order, or returned to the country after being deported. </p>

<p>&quot;President Trump has been clear in affirming the critical mission of DHS in protecting the nation and directed our Department to focus on removing illegal aliens who have violated our immigration laws, with a specific focus on those who pose a threat to public safety, have been charged with criminal offenses, have committed immigration violations or have been deported and re-entered the country illegally,&quot; said Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly in a statement Monday. </p>

<p>&quot;The question is, who are they counting as criminals?&quot; Camille Mackler, director of legal initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition, told Gothamist. &quot;This is just putting a very false and derogatory face of immigrants in general, because they are saying that these are all criminals, but they&apos;ve defined criminal so broadly that... if you actually look at them, they aren&apos;t all people who everyday Americans would consider a threat.&quot; </p>

<p>Historically, &quot;The most deportable immigrants are the ones with aggregated felonies, and then the violent or sexual aggregated felonies,&quot; said Michael Musa-Obregon, an immigrant defense attorney based in New York. &quot;Then you have the majority of people that are still deportable, for convictions such as shoplifting, minor domestic violence as opposed to major, or fraudulent documentation, like false green cards and drivers licenses.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Trump&apos;s stated policy is that he&apos;s going to pursue people with even minor offenses aggressively,&quot; Musa-Obregon added. </p>

<p>ICE has said in recent days that last week&apos;s activity was routine. According to the agency, ICE arrested 1,660 people across the country in August 2013, 1,517 of whom had criminal convictions. On the local level, ICE made 16 arrests in Milwaukee in January; 74 arrests in Michigan and Ohio in December; and more than 100 in the Los Angeles area last July. An operation last August in the New York City area resulted in 58 arrests. </p>

<p>(For the sake of further comparison, we asked ICE for the arrest numbers for the same period of time last year, and will update if we get them.)</p>

<p>But advocates in New York have countered that they are troubled by the pace and scale of recent ICE operations.</p>

<p>&quot;There were no concerted raids under the Obama administration for low-level criminal offenders, or for people with deportation orders, in the last three or four years. We hadn&apos;t heard of them,&quot; Musa-Obregon said. &quot;It was a dormant situation that all of a sudden woke up.&quot; </p>
