New Yorkers eager to carry the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/19/anti_trump_bannon_protests.php">momentum</a> of recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/20/photos_ban_bannon_march_stops_to_sa.php#photo-1">anti-Trump protests</a> through our President-elect&apos;s inauguration&#x2014;but for whom a trip to Washington D.C. presents logistical challenges&#x2014;now have an NYC option: a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/https://www.facebook.com/events/1601810850126741/">sister march</a> to the planned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/https://www.facebook.com/events/2169332969958991/">Women&apos;s March On Washington</a> is in the works for the day after inauguration.<p></p>

<p>Nearly 3,000 people have already committed to the march on Facebook, which will assemble in Union Square around 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, January 21st ahead of a march on Trump Tower. </p>

<p>And while women are organizing this march, it&apos;s eminently clear that all are welcome. </p>

<p>&quot;Marching to the doorsteps of this tower to promote the advancement of equality and human rights for all women, minorities, and immigrants sends a clear message to the incoming cabinet that we are watching,&quot; wrote organizers Katherine Siemionko and Hayley Dwight in a public Facebook event posted last week. &quot;This march also sends a message to the millions of foreign onlookers that the United States of America is not racist, sexist, or anti-gay.&quot; </p>

<p>While hate incidents have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/nypd_hate_crime_stats.php">spiked</a> in the aftermath of Trump&apos;s election&#x2014;following a campaign that stoked racist, sexist, and homophobic sentiment&#x2014;opposition to that hate has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/20/ad_rock_elected_officials_gather_at.php#photo-1">swift and fierce</a>. </p>

<p>Earlier this morning, Mayor de Blasio addressed New Yorkers&apos; resilience <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/21/de_blasio_cooper_union_2.php">in a speech</a> at Cooper Union in Manhattan. &quot;The results of an election don&apos;t change who we are,&quot; he said. &quot;A single office-holder doesn&apos;t change who we are; a law that gets passed in Washington doesn&apos;t change who we are. We are 8.5 million strong, and we ain&apos;t changing. We are always New York. <em>Somos siempre Nueva York</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Dozens of other sister marches are planned for January, 21st, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/https://www.facebook.com/events/644071919106389">New Jersey</a>, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124112445/https://www.facebook.com/events/160520691084922/">London</a>.
