<p>Two of Time Square&apos;s teal green <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/09/dazd_confused_times_square.php">Designated Activity Zones</a>&#x2014;new, mandatory standing areas for costumed characters and ticket sellers&#x2014;were wet with fresh paint and marked off with caution tape Thursday morning. Less than two weeks into their enforcement, and amidst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/times_square_freedom_cage.php">complaints from their daily costumed inhabitants</a>, all eight zones will be painted two feet wider&#x2014;a slightly roomier 10&apos; x 50&apos;. </p>

<p>Department of Transportation spokeswoman Alana Morales confirmed the adjustment. &quot;As we&apos;ve said we (and NYPD) would monitor the DAZ once they were installed and enforcement began to see if any adjustments needed to be made,&quot; she stated. &quot;The DAZ are being extended 2 feet in width to allow for more space. We will continue to monitor.&quot; </p>

<p>During a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/joker_times_square_costumes.php">City Council hearing on the zones</a> this spring, DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg pitched zones roughly the size of a city bus, spread across a 112,000 square-foot area on the Times Square pedestrian plaza. She stressed that &quot;we anticipate some trial and error.&quot; </p>

<p>We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/times_square_freedom_cage.php">spoke to some Times Square costumed characters</a> a few days into DAZ enforcement last week, and most of them expressed frustration with the zones, which they say are demeaning and increase their competition&#x2014;compelling tourists, characters and ticket sellers to cram together into a narrow space. </p>

<p>&quot;You ever see those animals at the Bronx Zoo? That&apos;s how I feel,&quot; said Louis M., an Elmo.</p>

<p>&quot;We used to go out on corners,&quot; Rosa B., dressed as Minnie Mouse, said in Spanish. &quot;The model was to go up to people and convince them to take a picture. Now we have to somehow try to get them to come to us.&quot;</p>

<p>Violations of the DAZ are punishable by fines that can go up to $500, and after repeat offenses, jail time. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/index.aspx">Times Square Alliance</a>, a business interest group that lobbied for the zones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/times_square_disney_crackdown.php">with a PR boost from the Naked Cowboy</a>, said on Thursday that they have also replaced signs that read &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/times_square_freedom_cage.php#photo-1">tipping street performers is optional</a>&quot; with new signs bearing a slightly more transaction-friendly slogan: &quot;If you take a photo with an entertainer, please note they expect a tip.&quot; </p>

<p>Several costumed characters worked the zones on Thursday morning, even as cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/30/your_move_naked_cowboy.php">apprehended and hospitalized</a> a naked man drawing attention to himself over the TKTS booth in Duffy Square. One family of tourists from Vancouver declined to tip, despite the new signage. After taking a picture inside the zone, the mother moved along while a character dressed as the Hulk pointed to a handheld card asking for tips. </p>

<p>Afterwards, the mother told us that she assumed the characters were part of a promotion, perhaps for Disney, and that she didn&apos;t think tipping was part of the equation. Minutes later, a few children ran into a zone while their parents stood back, delayed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101115/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/24/fake_monks_high_line.php">a fake Buddhist monk</a>. The second family declined to tip as well. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, several characters strayed from the zones.  </p>

<p>&quot;The Times Square Alliance remains very pleased with the first few weeks of enforcement, and we appreciate this proactive response to feedback by the NYPD and Department of Transportation,&quot; said an Alliance spokesman on Thursday.</p>
