<p>Brooklyn Assemblywoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184424/http://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/">Diana Richardson</a>, who represents Crown Heights, Prospect-Lefferts Gardens and East Flatbush, was arrested early Saturday morning after her 13-year-old son walked into the 71st Precinct station and told police that his mother had struck him with a broomstick. </p>

<p>The alleged incident stemmed from an argument over the child&apos;s grades in school, according to police. Richardson&apos;s son went for help around 11:30 p.m. on Friday. Officers then responded to their President Street home in Crown Heights and arrested Richardson on charges of assault, a felony, as well as endangering the welfare of a child, harassment, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. </p>

<p>Richardson, 33, struck her son&apos;s left arm with the broomstick causing &quot;redness and pain,&quot; a police spokesperson added. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184424/http://nypost.com/2016/11/07/assemblywoman-who-allegedly-beat-son-was-a-child-advocate/">An NYPD source told the Post</a> that the argument stemmed from his refusal to write an essay about improving his grades. </p>

<p>The child was hospitalized, according to the criminal complaint. The alleged assault also prompted him to &quot;fear further physical injury and to become alarmed and annoyed.&quot; </p>

<p>Elected on the Working Families ticket in 2015, Richardson is up for reelection on tomorrow&apos;s ballot, unopposed. During her time in office, she&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184424/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/03/crown_heights_rent_war.php">frequented pro-tenant rallies</a> at residential buildings in her swiftly gentrifying district. She is also chairwoman of the Assembly&apos;s subcommittee on foster care, and has introduced legislation that would require the city&apos;s Administration for Children&#x2019;s Services to submit annual reports on its cases to the governor. Her key issues are &quot;housing, juvenile justice, and criminal justice reform,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184424/http://nyassembly.gov/mem/Diana-C-Richardson/photos">according to her website</a>. </p>

<p>Richardson is also a single mother, and often brings her son to events and rallies, according to fellow politicians. An online biography refers to the teen as &quot;her greatest accomplishment.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve seen her and her son together for many years,&quot; New York Working Families Director Bill Lipton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184424/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/nyregion/support-and-dismay-for-brooklyn-assemblywoman-after-charges-she-hit-her-son.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a>. &quot;It&apos;s a very close, loving relationship. He was on the campaign trail with her all the time.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Former City Council Member Una S. T. Clarke&#x2014;who, like Richardson, is of West Indian descent&#x2014;told the paper that her friend&apos;s actions pointed to the importance of education in their families. &quot;Part of it is cultural,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Caribbean parents don&apos;t care if it&apos;s the weekend or midweek. There are expectations that we have for our children, and education comes first.&quot; </p>

<p>Richardson&apos;s office did not respond to a request for comment. This morning, she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184424/https://www.facebook.com/diana.richardson.92">posted on her Facebook wall</a> that she was &quot;feeling heartbroken.&quot; Comments on the post are primarily offerings of prayers and support. </p>

<p>&quot;Sending love and prayers for the both of you,&quot; wrote Mahadya Mary. &quot;Being the mother of a 13 year old boy I know that no one can or will Love your son more you [sic].&quot; </p>

<p>Richardson was reportedly released from police custody on Saturday, with a temporary order of protection. Her next court appearance is January 10th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184424/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/nyregion/support-and-dismay-for-brooklyn-assemblywoman-after-charges-she-hit-her-son.html?_r=0">The NY Times reports</a> that her son is staying with a relative. </p>

<p><strong>[Update 4:30 p.m.]:</strong> Richardson issued a statement on Monday afternoon. &quot;We would like to express our thanks for the support and generosity of the community,&quot; she said. &quot;We ask that you respect our privacy as we find strength during this time.&quot; </p>
