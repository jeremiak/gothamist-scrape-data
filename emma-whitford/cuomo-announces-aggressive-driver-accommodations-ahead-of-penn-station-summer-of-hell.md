<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612170612/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/23/subway_genius_wanted.php">made it no secret</a> that he doubts Amtrak&apos;s ability to complete <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612170612/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/25/amtrak_tracks_penn_station.php#photo-1">emergency repair work</a> at Penn Station in a timely fashion this summer. And while Amtrak has rebuffed the governor&apos;s public offer to step in and take over, Cuomo inserted himself into the process this morning with a pledge to speed up bridge and tunnel repairs by early July. More commuters will ditch the train for a car during the eight-plus weeks of work, the logic goes. If bridge and tunnel work is out of the way by then, drivers will be less bottlenecked. </p>

<p>&quot;Our top priority is ensuring all New Yorkers can get where they need to go as quickly and easily as possible this summer and we&apos;re taking every conceivable step to prepare for Amtrak&apos;s summer of hell,&quot; Governor Cuomo stated Monday. &quot;By aggressively expediting construction we are taking action to ease commutes and provide New Yorkers with peace of mind.&quot;</p>

<p>The statement prompted quick backlash from transit advocates, who have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612170612/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/19/mta_cuomo_subway_broken.php">long criticized</a> Governor Cuomo&apos;s underinvestment in the decaying subway system. Some have made the case that Cuomo&apos;s investments in highways, tunnels and bridges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612170612/http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/01/19/cuomos-priorities-2-billion-to-cram-more-cars-on-the-van-wyck/">encourage more driving</a>, and should take a back seat. Cuomo&apos;s $500 million investment in cashless tolls, for example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612170612/https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/10/27/cuomo-diverts-mtas-focus-to-shiny-500-million-toll-booths-sorry-subway-commuters/">raised eyebrows</a> at an MTA Board meeting last fall. </p>

<p>Ongoing construction work on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, Queens-Midtown Tunnel, Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, and Hugh L. Carry Tunnel will be complete by July 8th, according to the Governor&apos;s Office, in collaboration with the MTA and State Department of Transportation. </p>

<p><strong>Verrazano Narrows Bridge:</strong> Cashless tolling to be complete by July 8th, moved up from November 30th; new Brooklyn-bound lane for buses and high-occupancy vehicles by June 19th, up from November 30th, increasing road capacity by 16 percent, according to the State. </p>

<p><strong>Queens-Midtown Tunnel:</strong> North tube construction accelerated from August 31st to July 8th, with both tubes open during daytime hours; second of two downtown Manhattan exit ramps will reopen, having been closed since last September. </p>

<p><strong>Robert F. Kennedy Bridge:</strong> Cashless tolling; new 125th Street Manhattan on-bound ramp to RFK Bridge (one of two lanes has been closed since last February); complete construction of Queens-to-Manhattan ramp; complete construction of Queens and Bronx-bound plaza; complete demolition of Bronx and Manhattan toll plazas, up form an initial September 30th completion date. </p>

<p><strong>Hugh L. Carey Tunnel:</strong> Completion of three outbound lanes from lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>Expectations on service disruption during the scheduled July 7th-25th and August 4th-28th Penn Station repairs have varied, ranging between 20 and 25 percent reductions in service during peak hours. </p>

<p>Penn Station is already bursting at the seams, with 600,000 daily passengers&#x2014;more than triple the station&apos;s intended capacity, according to the Governor&apos;s Office. The planned repair work will take three of the station&apos;s 21 tracks out of commission for weeks at a time. That&apos;s 14 percent of the total tracks, and 19 percent of the 16 tracks that serve NJ Transit and Amtrak.</p>

<p>Two disgruntled Amtrak passengers from Long Island are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612170612/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/11/frustrated_commuters_file_class_act.php#photo-1">suing</a> the MTA, the LIRR and New York City Transit&#x2014;alleging negligence for the amount of emotional distress they&apos;ve endured at the disaster-prone transit hub. </p>
