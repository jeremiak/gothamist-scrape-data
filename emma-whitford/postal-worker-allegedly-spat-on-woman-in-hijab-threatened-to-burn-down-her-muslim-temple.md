<p>A postal worker was arrested early Tuesday morning for allegedly spitting on a Muslim woman in hijab and yelling that he would burn her &quot;Muslim temple&quot; while she pushed her baby in a stroller in Bed-Stuy last Friday night. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the 30-year-old victim was walking with her sister, also in hijab, past NBA Deli on the corner of Nostrand Avenue and Halsey Street around 8:30 p.m. on Friday when 33-year-old Dainton Coley started accosting her. Coley, wearing his postal uniform, began shouting at the victim, allegedly calling her a &quot;bumbaclot Muslim&quot; and threatening to &quot;burn your Muslim temple down&quot; before spitting on her, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224710/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-grilling-person-interest-anti-muslim-attack-article-1.2445346">the Daily News reports</a>. </p>

<p>Mustapha Ndanusa, an attorney for the two sisters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224710/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Muslim-Attack-Spit-Brooklyn-Woman-Hijab-Police-Hate-Crime-Investigation-353176791.html">told NBC</a> that the women were on their way home from a mosque when the incident occurred. </p>

<p>&quot;She heard &apos;Muslim&apos; and other derogatory words, and that guy said something I think like, &apos;I&apos;m going to burn down your temple,&apos; and then the person proceeded to spit in her face and elbow her,&quot; the attorney said. </p>

<p>NBC reports that Coley lashed out when the victim bumped into him with her stroller. Both women turned into the deli when Coley confronted them, but he followed and continued to verbally harass them. The scene in the deli was captured on security camera.</p>

Deli manager Jamel Abdulla <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224710/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/24/postal-worker-brooklyn-muslim-hate-crime-arrest/">told CBS</a> that he tried to intervene. He said he recognized Coley, who often came through for a beer. &quot;He make a lot of noise in the street all the time,&quot; Abdulla said. 

<p>The US Post Office got in touch with the Hate Crimes Task Force late Monday night, when they recognized Coley as an employee at the post office on Atlantic Avenue. Coley has since been charged with acting in a manner injurious to a child, harassment and menacing as a hate crime.</p>

<p>NYPD data shows a 43% decreased in anti-Muslim hate crimes over the last year&#x2014;from 23 by mid-November last year, to thirteen by mid-November 2015. </p>

<p>Last week, a 28-year-old medical student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224710/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/17/texting_while_black.php">was harassed</a> by a man who accused him of looking &quot;suspicious&quot; for sending texts on his phone at an Upper West Side movie theater. &quot;You know what happened in Paris,&quot; the man said. <br>
