<p>The America&apos;s Cup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025132922/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/29/2016_americas_cup_will_be_in_nyc_fo.php">is sailing back to New York Harbor</a> this weekend, for the first time in almost a century. This weekend&apos;s races, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday from 2:00 to 3:30 p.m., are part of a series of warmups leading up to the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025132922/https://www.americascup.com/en/bermuda.html">America&#x2019;s Cup 2017</a>. The big event will be happening in Bermuda in June 2017.</p>

<p>Six teams will be sailing in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025132922/https://www.americascup.com/en/world-series-AC45.html">Louis Vuitton America&#x2019;s Cup World Series</a>, each on behalf of a home country. Oracle Team USA, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025132922/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/sports/sailing/new-york-louis-vuitton-americas-cup-world-series-regatta.html">defending champions</a> (!), will face Emirates Team New Zealand, Land Rover BAR for Great Britain, Artemis Racing for Sweden, SoftBank Team Japan, and Groupama Team France. For those who are new to all this, the organizers clarify: </p>

<blockquote>All six teams will race against one another at the same time, in a fleet racing format.

<p>The Louis Vuitton America&#x2019;s Cup World Series is raced in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025132922/http://acws-gothenburg.americascup.com/en/about_the_boat.html">AC45F class</a>&#x2014;a one-design catamaran powered by a wing sail, and sailed by a crew of five. This new version of the AC45 flies above the water on hydrofoils and is capable of speeds near 40 mph.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Race organizers are expecting crowds in the thousands on both days; and while &quot;many spectators&quot; are planning to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025132922/https://www.americascup.com/en/spectator-boats.html">watch from the comfort of their private boats</a>, pedestrians are encouraged to head to Battery Park City or Waterfront Plaza at Brookfield Place for solid (free!) views. The finish line will be right by the Plaza, where a main stage will host live music, speeches from each team&apos;s skipper, and an award ceremony on Sunday. Big projection screens will prevent the need for excessive squinting, and a live commentator will call the races.  </p>

<p>The races will also be viewable along the Hudson River waterfront north to Pier 25, and from Liberty State Park in Jersey. </p>

<p>&#x201C;We have been eagerly awaiting this moment and look forward to getting out on the water for the races this weekend,&#x201D; said Oracle USA skipper Jimmy Spithill, in a statement. &#x201C;The uniqueness of the Hudson River, the currents, and the winds, should make for extremely competitive and exciting races.&#x201D;</p>
