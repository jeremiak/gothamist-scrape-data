<p>This morning, neighborhood gumshoe blog Tribeca Citizen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028210706/http://tribecacitizen.com/2016/10/25/the-return-of-pearl-river-mart/">reported</a> that Pearl River Mart has secured a new, smaller home in Tribeca&#x2014;six months after its brocade coin purse and paper lantern emporium on Broadway shuttered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028210706/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/07/rip_pearl_river_mart.php#photo-4">in the face of a massive rent hike</a>. </p>

<p>The possible new location, reported without sourcing, is 395 Broadway on the corner of Walker Street in Tribeca, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028210706/http://www.leeassociatesnyc.com/listings.php">ground floor space</a> with an accompanying mezzanine and basement totaling 5,725 square feet (that&apos;s a humbler home than 477 Broadway in Soho, which clocked at 30,000 square feet). </p>

<p>JP Sutro, the managing director for 395 Broadway leaser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028210706/http://www.leeassociatesnyc.com/index.php">Lee &amp; Associates</a>, refused to confirm anything on the record on Tuesday. &quot;Where&apos;d you hear that?&quot; he asked us. &quot;I can&apos;t really confirm anything on this end, because we&apos;re still working on a portion of the building and the landlord hasn&apos;t really given an answer on what he wants done with it.&quot;</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Pearl River also declined to divulge details, though she confirmed some news is pending. &quot;Great to hear from you,&quot; she said. &quot;Pearl River will be making an announcement tomorrow regarding their plans.&quot; Asked to elaborate, she said the exclusive has been given to a &quot;business paper.&quot; </p>

<p>All of this suggests that Tribeca Citizen is on to something. Regardless, we won&apos;t have to wait long for confirmation. </p>

<p>Pearl River Mart was co-founded in 1971, under the name Chinese Native Products, by company president Ching Yeh Chen, her husband Ming Yi Chen, and a group of student activists from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The Chens&apos; original store location was on Elizabeth Street in Chinatown. Taking the name Pearl River in 1978, the store made a pit-stop on the corner of Canal and Broadway in 1986 before settling into 477 Broadway. </p>

<p>When news of the old location&apos;s pending closure broke in April 2015, Ching Yeh Chen told us plans for a smaller location were in the works (in addition to the online shop, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028210706/http://pearlriver.com/v3/index.asp">browse here</a>). </p>

<p>&quot;We truly believe that to have a strong and modern website, and take advantage of the social media, is one of the major things that Pearl River has to do,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;a brick-and-mortar of a much smaller size would be important too, because that&apos;s part of Pearl River. People can spend hours here!&quot;</p>
