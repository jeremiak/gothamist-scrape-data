<p>Tomorrow marks the one year anniversary of the most deadly crash in Metro-North history, involving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234204/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/04/metro-north_crash_driver.php">Metro-North train and a civilian SUV</a> at a railroad crossing in Westchester County. To coincide with the anniversary, the family of the deceased driver, 49-year-old Ellen Brody, is suing the Metro-North and the State of New York&#x2014;as well as Westchester County and the town of Mount Pleasant&#x2014;for negligence and wrongful death. </p>

<p>&quot;The accident happened because the railroad crossing is a dangerous crossing that should have been eliminated,&quot; said Philip Russotti, the family&apos;s attorney, on Tuesday. &quot;The signage is inadequate and confusing. The accident was caused by a confluence of problems, none of which were her fault. She was a victim.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_02_fatalcollision.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234204im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/2015_02_fatalcollision.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i>NTSB investigators at the crash scene (NTSB)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Brody was driving her Mercedes SUV on the night of February 3, 2015 when she stopped in the tracks at a red light over Commerce Street in Mount Pleasant, according to an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. According to the MTA at the time, &quot;The gates came down on top of the vehicle, which was stopped on the tracks. The driver got out to look at the rear of the car, then she got back in and drove forward and was stuck.&quot;</p>

<p>Brody&apos;s SUV was struck at about 6:30 p.m. by a 5:44 p.m. Harlem Line train out of Grand Central, with 800 passengers. The train&apos;s engineer was traveling at 58 miles per hour, well under the 70 mph speed limit, and threw on his breaks to no avail, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234204/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/07/metro-north_engineer_very_traumatiz.php">according to investigators</a>. About 400 feet of the electrified third rail pierced the first car, causing an explosion. Five passengers in the first car of the train were killed. </p>

<p>An initial investigation revealed that Brody was unfamiliar with the rail crossing, which is at a curved road. A witness said she appeared to have stopped in the rail crossing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234204/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/06/metro_north_suv_crossing.php">for at least 30 seconds</a> before she was struck. </p>

<p>The suit, to be filed on Wednesday, outlines myriad alleged safety failures, as well as instances of noncompliance with the Railroad Highway Grade Crossing Handbook. For example, the crossing at Commerce Street in Mount Pleasant cuts across the Metro-North tracks at a 177 degree angle, reducing sight lines. The suit also claims that a combination of obstructive buildings, dim lighting, and vegetation at and around the intersection likely reduced sight lines for Brady. </p>

<p>Russotti added that the light at the intersection should have been synched with the train signal, so that an approaching train would have coincided with a green light. The queue space between tracks and light is too short, he added, increasing the likelihood that a driver could land on the tracks at a red light. </p>

<p>From 2012 to 2014, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234204/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/transit/2015/02/04/valhallas-commerce-street-train-crossing-site-fatal-crash/22868251/">reportedly</a> 81 crashes resulting in 15 deaths at intersections in New York where railroad tracks cross a road. Russotti said that the Commerce Street crossing should have been shut down years ago, citing an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234204/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/metro-north-crash-site-fatal-accident-1984-records-article-1.2103066">October 1984 train crash</a> that killed a cable company worker stopped at the same intersection. </p>

<p>In the weeks following the crash, the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234204/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/nyregion/at-rail-crossings-in-new-york-area-a-constantly-lurking-danger.html">conducted a thorough investigation</a> of the ten most dangerous railroad crossings in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut as determined by the Federal Railroad Administration. The report found that many railroad crossings in the region bear the characteristics outlined in this month&apos;s suit&#x2014;harsh angles and awkward traffic signals that can nudge drivers into the tracks. </p>

<p>Russotti said the amount sought in damages has yet to be determined. He added that, more broadly, &quot;What we hope to do is eliminate the safety problems of railroad crossings.&quot; </p>

<p>The MTA declined to comment on the claim. However, the agency reiterated safety measures it has implemented in the last year&#x2014;last September, the MTA Board approved a $269,000 contract to conduct risk assessment at 20 railroad crossings. A second, three-year assessment of &quot;priority&quot; LIRR and Metro-North crossings is scheduled to commence this year. </p>

<p>According to the MTA, the town of Mount Pleasant is investigating the possibility of closing the crossing at Commerce Street. </p>
