<p>The MTA&apos;s transit committee voted Monday to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133430/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/w_train_boooooooy.php">resurrect</a> a truncated version of the long-suspended W train, from Astoria in Queens to Whitehall Street in Lower Manhattan. The W got the axe in 2010, when the MTA budget deficit was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133430/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/24/mta_money_cuomo.php">comparatively-paltry</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133430/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/mta_may_eliminate_w_train_among_oth.php">$1.2 billion</a>. Bringing it back, the MTA says, will ease the insult of lost Q service in Astoria, when that train reroutes to new stations on 2nd Avenue in Manhattan. </p>

<p>The approved W train proposal will likely pass a full committee vote on Wednesday, and service is expected to launch in November&#x2014;before the MTA reroutes the Q train, which currently serves Astoria along with the N, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133430/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/27/2nd_ave_subway_photos.php">promised</a> new stations between 63rd and 96th streets. </p>

<p>Before the Second Avenue Subway stations open to the public, the Q will temporarily terminate at 57th street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133430/http://www.amny.com/transit/w-train-revival-set-for-mta-approval-1.11832462">AM New York reports</a> that N trains will start running express during peak weekday hours as soon as the W is on the rails. </p>

<p>Incorporated into the subway system in 2001, the W ran from Astoria all the way to Coney Island until 2004. That year, the W switched to a local route from Astoria to Whitehall. Along with the V train and several bus routes, it was nixed as part of the largest service cut in the MTA&apos;s history&#x2014;at a time when Astoria was seeing an influx of new residents. (&quot;To cut the only service to this neighborhood in half would be like choking the breath out of this community,&quot; Council Member Peter Vallone Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133430/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/mta_may_eliminate_w_train_among_oth.php">said at the time</a>.)</p>

<p>Addressing the MTA transit committee on Monday, Board Member Andrew Albert said that while he endorses the plan, he&apos;d like to see the W fully restored to something closer to its pre-2004 glory. </p>

<p>&quot;I will still put in a pitch for, during rush hour, extending the W down to say, a Bay Parkway terminus,&quot; he said. &quot;Having the R the only train along local stations along 4th Avenue and rapidly developing areas of Southern Brooklyn is not enough.&quot; </p>

<p>Albert argued that W trains will be originating in Brooklyn anyway, and will be passing through R stations that the MTA is planning to skip. </p>

<p>Rail service planning manager Judy McClain countered that ridership along the R line doesn&apos;t merit a service expansion; even if it did, she clarified, &quot;we don&apos;t have the equipment right now.&quot; McClain added somewhat vaguely that, &quot;in the future, if ridership grows, we can get more cars.&quot; Until then, some W trains will stop in Brooklyn on their way into service early in the morning, picking up passengers along the way like a regular R train. </p>

<p>Regardless, here&apos;s hoping the W train&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133430/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/next-stop-on-the-w-train-history/">boozy funeral</a> will get an equally enthusiastic re-birthday follow-up.</p>
