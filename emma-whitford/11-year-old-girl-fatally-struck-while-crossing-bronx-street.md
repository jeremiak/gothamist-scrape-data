<p>According to a preliminary investigation, the child was crossing 180th Street from the south just before 11:45 a.m. when a 35-year-old man behind the wheel of a 2014 black Toyota Camry struck her. The driver, who had been headed west on East 180th Street, remained on the scene. </p>

<p>Witness Verenis Beverreno, a clerk at a nearby deli, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161231133858/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/girl-11-struck-killed-car-crossing-street-bronx-article-1.2925626">told the Daily News</a> that the driver struck the victim&apos;s head. </p>

<p>&quot;The child was in front of the store,&quot; she told the tabloid. &quot;She always comes here. She walked by and the car ran over her. She was trying to cross the street on 180th Street to go to her apartment.&quot;</p>

<p>Responding officers found the girl lying in the road with trauma to her body. They transported her to St. Barnabas Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the NYPD could not confirm if the child was in the crosswalk when she was struck, or if the driver was obeying traffic lights. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>There have been 499 crashes with injuries in the Bronx&apos;s 48th Precinct this year as of December 18th, according to the NYPD&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161231133858/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/traffic_crash_map_nypd.php">new TrafficStat tracker</a>&#x2014;compared to 435 last year. Today&apos;s crash appears to mark the precinct&apos;s first fatal traffic crash in at least two years. The intersection where the girl was killed had not seen any crashes in 2016 before today, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161231133858/http://www.visionzeroview.nyc/">Vision Zero View</a>. </p>
