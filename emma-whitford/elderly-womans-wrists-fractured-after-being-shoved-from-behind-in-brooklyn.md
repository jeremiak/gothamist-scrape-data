<p>Police are looking for a woman who allegedly shoved an 88-year-old woman to the ground last week, fracturing both of her wrists. </p>

<p>The elderly victim was standing outside Esther&apos;s Deli at 3664 Nostrand Avenue in Sheepshead Bay around 5:00 p.m. on Friday when an unidentified woman approached from behind, according to the NYPD. The woman then pushed her to the ground and ran away down the sidewalk. The victim was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in stable condition, where she was treated for two fractured wrists. </p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman said the victim did not know her attacker, and that the two did not exchange words before the surprise assault. The suspect didn&apos;t make off with any of the elderly woman&apos;s possessions. </p>

<p>The suspect, who was captured on surveillance footage, was last seen with her hair in a ponytail and glasses. She was wearing a gray hat, gray sweatshirt, beige sweater and brown work boots. </p>
