<p>The Attorney General&apos;s office has launched a probe into the shooting death of an unarmed suspect in Westchester County on Tuesday. A police officer from the 50th Precinct in the Bronx fired the fatal shot, following a wild <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/nypd_chase_ends_in_crash_on_saw_mil.php">car chase from the Bronx</a> up the Henry Hudson Parkway to the Saw Mill River Parkway. </p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/08/cuomo_special_prosecutor.php">issued an executive order</a> appointing Attorney General Eric Schneiderman as a special prosecutor on police-killing deaths in June. This is the second time the AG has exercised that right, concurrent with an ongoing investigation into the death of 42-year-old Raynette Turner, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/03/raynette_turner_probe.php">found dead in a holding cell</a> in Mount Vernon after being arrested for allegedly shoplifting crab legs from a nearby grocery store.  </p>

<p>Representatives from Schneiderman&#x2019;s office were already on the scene in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Tuesday afternoon, even before the officers involved in the shooting had been interviewed by the department, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/nyregion/new-york-state-attorney-general-takes-control-of-inquiry-into-fatal-police-shooting.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=1">according to the NY Times</a>. </p>

<p>The deceased, 36-year-old Miguel Espinal, had reportedly been living in Florida at the time of his death, but grew up in Queens. Two officers from the 50th Precinct, since identified as Garthlette James and Romeo Francis, tried to pull Espinal&apos;s car over before noon at 242nd Street and Broadway&#x2014;he was reportedly driving erratically&#x2014;and continued to pursue him towards Yonkers. </p>

<p>Following a dramatic crash that left Espinal&apos;s car pinned between two police vehicles, Espinal jumped from the vehicle and fled into adjacent Tibbetts Brook Park. The officers pursued him, and James fired one shot, killing Espinal. </p>

<p>&quot;One shot was discharged from one New York City police officer&apos;s weapon,&quot; Westchester Public Safety Commissioner George Longworth said in a statement. </p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2015/12/08/saw-mill-yonkers-pursuit/76979854/">told the Journal News</a> that he saw Espinal get out of the car and run into the park. &quot;The next thing I heard was gunshots,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>An NYPD representative confirmed that no weapons were recovered from the scene. </p>

<p>Espinal&apos;s passenger, 25-year-old Akeem Smith, was taken into custody at the crash scene and hospitalized in stable condition. </p>

<p>Advocates, many of them relatives of New Yorkers killed by police including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://gothamist.com/tags/ericgarner">Eric Garner</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/fired_sean_bell_shooting_detective.php">Sean Bell</a>, began pushing for a special prosecutor last December, when a Staten Island Grand Jury chose<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/eric_garner_grand_jury.php"> not to indict</a> Officer Daniel Pantaleo for fatally choking Eric Garner. The appointment will go up for renewal next July, and is therefore at risk of expiration. </p>

<p>Cuomo&apos;s push to have the appointment signed into law <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090532/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/07/8571635/flanagan-casts-doubt-cuomos-special-prosecutor">failed in June</a>. </p>

<p>Schniederman&apos;s investigative unit has 15 lawyers and 20 investigators, according to the NY Times. If the unit decides that there is enough evidence to support filing charges, it will launch a special grand jury to hear evidence. </p>

<p>Autopsy results, which will go far in determining how close officer James was to Espinal when the shot was fired, are pending. </p>
