<p>The NYC Parks Department has reversed its decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/nyregion/a-problematic-sculpture-is-silenced-by-new-york-parks-officials.html">censor</a> a sixteen-foot sculpture in Riverside Park that a local artist hopes will compel parkgoers to challenge hate in all of its manifestations. </p>

<p>Artist Aaron Bell&apos;s <em>Stand Tall, Stand Loud</em>, which was unveiled this week in its censored form, will be altered in the coming weeks to reflect the artist&apos;s original design&#x2014;a human form topped with a noose twisted into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/https://images.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search;_ylt=A0LEVjrMRmRXdYYAXFAnnIlQ?p=banned+circle+with+line+through+it+image&amp;fr=yhs-mozilla-002&amp;fr2=piv-web&amp;hspart=mozilla&amp;hsimp=yhs-002#id=1&amp;iurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clipartbest.com%2Fcliparts%2Fdi7%2FjA7%2Fdi7jA7n6T.gif&amp;action=click">symbol</a> that indicates a banned activity. </p>

<p>The decision was reached after a meeting between Bell, his attorney, and the Parks Department on Tuesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2016/06/parks-dept-reverses-noose-sculpture.html">as first reported by A Walk In The Park</a>. </p>

<p>Bell conceived <em>Stand Tall, Stand Loud</em> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://www.theartstudentsleague.org/special-programs/model-to-monument/">Model to Monument</a>, a joint NYC Parks-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://www.theartstudentsleague.org/">Art Students League of New York</a> competition that selects eight works each year for display in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx and Riverside Park South on the Upper West Side. The theme for this year&apos;s competition was &quot;The Public Square&quot;; artists were encouraged to consider the role of public spaces in sparking dialogue, according to the Art Students League website. </p>

<p>&quot;[My piece] will serve as a reminder to the diverse flow of visitors that we each should encourage and strive to make tolerance and understanding a daily minimum requirement,&quot; Bell wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nNOOSEQUOTE.pdf">in an artist statement</a> obtained by West Side Rag. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="061716_Bell.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/061716_Bell.jpeg" width="640" height="428"> <br> <i> Bell (L) at the dedication of his sculpture on Thursday. At right is a poster of what the installation will look like in a couple of weeks (via Geoffrey Croft/NYC Park Advocates). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Bell, who is black, added that the noose was conceived as &quot;the embodiment of all forms of hate found in society&quot;&#x2014;towards &quot;LGBT communities, religious communities, racial and ethnic communities,&quot; as well as &quot;corrupt members of police departments and corrupt governments... bullies and egocentric politicians.&quot; </p>

<p>The sculpture is inscribed at its base with this Martin Luther King., Jr. quote: &quot;Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="061716_Sculpture2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/061716_Sculpture2.jpeg" width="320" height="696"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> A model of the second iteration of Bell&apos;s sculpture, featuring a line through the noose. Parks rejected this version (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nNOOSEQUOTE.pdf">via</a>). </i></div> In a move that seemed to blatantly defy Bell&apos;s message, city officials rejected his proposal outright last November. That version of the statue was topped with a noose, according to images supplied by the Parks Department. Bell then pitched a revision with a line through the noose, which was also rejected. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/nyregion/a-problematic-sculpture-is-silenced-by-new-york-parks-officials.html">The NY Times reports</a> that Jennifer Lantzas, who coordinates public art projects for city parks, e-mailed Parks staff expressing her concern that &quot;the image of the noose could be problematic for the borough.&quot;</p>

<p>Echoing the sentiment, Parks spokesman Sam Biederman told the paper via e-mail that Bell&apos;s project was rejected because its proposed site, near West 68th Street in Riverside Park, &quot;is adjacent to an area regularly programmed with passive recreational activities such as yoga, Pilates and senior movement.&quot; </p>

<p>As first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://www.westsiderag.com/2016/05/18/the-city-censored-a-sculpture-with-a-noose-for-riverside-park-exhibit-artist-says">reported by West Side Rag</a>, Bell alleged in May that the Model to Monument committee hadn&apos;t granted his requests to explain or defend his concept. </p>

<p>The Parks Department said at the time that all proposals had been reviewed by a departmental panel that included Parks Commissioner Mitchell Silver, and that works were subject to peer critique and revision. Factors that influenced the panel&apos;s decisions, they said, included safety and durability, as well as&#x2014;quite broadly&#x2014;general suitability. </p>

<p>In a partial reversal, Parks accepted a third version of the sculpture with no noose element&#x2014;the one erected this week. Bell chose to depict a large mouth, instead, despite his reservations. &quot;The mouth is simply a resolution to satisfy members of the Parks Department,&quot; he told the NY Times. </p>

<p>Parks spokesman Sam Biederman now says the department has approved a <em>fourth</em> version of the sculpture, with a bolder line through the noose. </p>

<p>&quot;Earlier this week Mr. Bell approached us with a fourth version which included the noose with a diagonal line more clearly placed,&quot; Biederman wrote via e-mail. &quot;Our art staff believed this final version (with the noose) depicted its message clearly and powerfully. It will be placed in the park in the coming weeks.&quot; </p>

<p>Geoffrey Croft of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/">NYC Park Advocates</a>, who says he spoke with Bell last night, strongly denied that the agency&#x2019;s issue was related to the size or placement of the line. &quot;The Parks Department has had the noose with the slash design since February,&quot; he said. &quot;The press department&apos;s repeated attempts to claim otherwise is shameful.&quot; Bell could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://ncac.org/">National Coalition Against Censorship</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://ncac.org/letters/stand-tall-stand-loud-censored-by-nyc-department-of-parks">wrote a letter</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211217/http://ncac.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/NCAC_NYC-Parks-Letter-June-2-2016.pdf">PDF</a>] to Commissioner Silver earlier this month, stating that his department&apos;s decision raised &quot;serious first amendment concerns&quot;: </p>

<blockquote>Art that expresses thoughts and ideas that are not to the taste of every single member of a community are nonetheless fully protected by the First Amendment. Aaron Bell&#x2019;s work, which addresses the important issue of racially-motivated violence, does so through imagery that enjoys full constitutional protection&#x2014;a protection that is not lessened by the possibility that the work and its message may make some viewers feel uncomfortable.</blockquote>

<p>&quot;NYC Parks is pleased to have come to an agreement with Mr. Bell, who shared with us a vision of his piece that suits the site and conveys its message clearly and powerfully,&quot; Beiderman stated. </p>
