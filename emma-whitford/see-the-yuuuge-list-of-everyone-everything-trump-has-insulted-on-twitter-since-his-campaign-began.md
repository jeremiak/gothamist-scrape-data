<p>Press coverage of Donald J. Trump is more plentiful than oxygen these days. There are the meticulous deep dives into his business ventures and money-handling that raise questions about how a man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/">exploits wage workers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/02/report_donald_trump_may_not_have_pa.php">avoids taxes</a>, and fudges his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/us/politics/donald-trump-charity.html">charitable giving</a> might flex his power in the Oval Office. Then there&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/more_trump_groping_claims.php">upswell</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/trump_groping_us_open.php">of allegations</a> from women who say Trump sexually abused them, bolstered by the steady flow of misogyny he&apos;s spewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">behind closed doors</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/donald_trump_i_couldnt_have_attacke.php">in public</a>. There&apos;s the constant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://www.wnyc.org/story/trump-vs-facts/">fact checking</a> of his denials, the analyses of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/trump_debate_nyc_republicans.php#photo-1">supporters</a>, and the dissection of those swing state people who might vote for him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/19/cnn_focus_group_trump_won_third_debate_10-5.html">but still aren&apos;t sure</a>. And don&apos;t forget the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/us/politics/trump-bigly-big-league-linguists.html?_r=0">debate</a> over &quot;bigly.&quot;</p>

<p>Amid all this, a constant, thrumming, election coverage hangover is inevitable. (That aching behind your eye sockets, right?) So with less than 15 days (15 days!!) until the election, the NY Times has brought us a palate cleanser of sorts. Not a break from the Trump news, but a distillation of it. Perhaps, the ultimate Trump coverage: a very long list, printed on dead trees, of every person, place and thing The Donald has insulted on Twitter since he declared his candidacy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/16/clown_car_donald_trump.php#photo-1">way back when we could laugh about all this</a>. </p>

<p>The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035551/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html">has kept a running list</a> online for some time now&#x2014;China (&quot;Terrible!&quot;), New Jersey (&quot;deeply troubled&quot;), Alec Baldwin (&quot;portrayal stinks&quot;)&#x2014;but there&apos;s something more physically arresting about dragging your ink-smudged pointer finger down the rows (and rows, and rows). Maybe walk over to the bodega and pick up a copy of this one for your bemused grandkids. </p>
