<p>Mayor de Blasio, First Lady Chirlane McCary, and their children Chiara and Dante stood before reporters on Monday afternoon to announce a $305 million commitment to destigmatize and expand treatment for the mentally ill. </p>

<p>Unlike a $22 million plan introduced over the summer geared explicitly towards mentally-ill New Yorkers with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/07/nyc_safe_hub_violence.php">history of violence</a>, the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/http://thrivenyc.cityofnewyork.us/#_intro">ThriveNYC</a> plan has a much broader scope, hypothetically addressing the needs of veterans with PTSD, mothers with postpartum depression, substance addicts seeking treatment, college students, and homeless youth with depressive symptoms. </p>

<p>The backdrop for this programing is a public awareness campaign aimed at &quot;changing the culture&quot; surrounding mental illness in NYC. According to the city, at least one in five New Yorkers is likely to grapple with a mental health issue in any given year. More than 25% of all students reported feeling persistently sad or hopeless in the last year, and drug overdose deaths outnumbered homicides. </p>

<p>&quot;People have these images in their mind, they don&apos;t want to be a member of this stigmatized group, they don&apos;t want to be seen as somebody like a homeless person or someone who&apos;s been in jail&#x2014;these negative images,&quot; McCray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/chirlane_mccray_mental_health.php">told reporters</a> over the summer. &quot;I think it&apos;s terrible that they&apos;re tied so closely together [with mental illness], because I think it prevents people from wanting to reach out and get help.&quot;</p>

<p>As if to set an example, de Blasio got very personal with reporters this afternoon, describing his own father&apos;s battle with alcoholism. </p>

<p>&quot;My dad would deny that he had an alcohol problem after many, many drinks&#x2026; he would say he could quit smoking any time he wanted,&quot; the mayor said. &quot;He&#x2019;d take the pack of cigarettes... and throw it out the window of the car and say, &apos;See, I can quit any time I want.&apos; Except there was a whole other carton in the glove compartment.&quot; </p>

<p>De Blasio added that his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/nyc_teen_text_hotline.php">daughter Chiara</a> has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/nyregion/in-speech-and-essay-chiara-de-blasio-details-her-depression-and-addiction.html?_r=0">shown him</a> the merits of AA, adding, &quot;I literarily wished at times there was a time machine where I could... go back in time to reach my father.&quot;</p>

<p>The $305 million in new funding, to be distributed over the next four years, will fund 23 new initiatives, including the immediate dispersal of 100 mental health consultants across the city&apos;s public school system, and the training of &quot;at least&quot; 1,000 new providers of buprenorphine, a drug that dampens opioid cravings. Starting next year, the city&apos;s 24/7 mental health crisis hotline will offer non-crisis referrals, help New Yorkers set up appointments based on their insurance options, and even conduct basic text and phone counseling sessions. </p>

<p>Another $1 million in grant money will go towards organizations that offer holistic treatment for Veterans suffering from chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia. And a pilot program at certain CUNY schools will provide college students with apps to &quot;self-manage&quot; their mental health. </p>

<p>A new Mental Health Service Finder, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/https://maps.nyc.gov/mental-health/">currently in Beta</a>, allows users to narrow their health treatment searches by age, type of care (mental health, substance abuse, both), and type of insurance (or lack thereof). A more refined search function filters for young mothers, domestic abuse victims, HIV/AIDS patients, and veterans.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the conference, a reporter asked the mayor if he had ever sought mental health counseling himself. </p>

<p>&quot;Back when I was in graduate school... I was going through some challenges, and I sought some counseling for a few weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;I got a few things off my chest and felt better.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/http://thrivenyc.cityofnewyork.us/#_intro">ThriveNYC website</a> lays out the full range of initiatives, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052615/http://thrivenyc.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MentalHealthRoadmap.pdf">PDF of the plan</a> goes into more detail on each of them. </p>
