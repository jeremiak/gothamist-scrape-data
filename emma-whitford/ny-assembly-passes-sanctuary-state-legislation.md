<p>In the face of President Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/trump_sanctuary_cities.php">threat</a> to withhold funding from so-called &quot;sanctuary cities&quot;&#x2014;cities including New York that limit communication between police, prisons, and federal immigration officials&#x2014;Assembly Democrats on Monday passed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://assembly.state.ny.us/Press/20170206/">legislation</a> that would create similar protections for non-citizens across the state.  </p>

<p>The legislation passed by a relatively narrow margin of 77-58, with some upstate and suburban Democrats siding with the Republicans to vote &apos;no,&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/02/assembly-passes-sanctuary-state-bill-as-trump-response-109389">according to Politico</a>. </p>

<p>Sponsored by Queens Assemblyman Francisco Moya (D), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A.3049B&amp;term=2017">New York State Liberty Act</a> would prohibit state and local police from conducting a stop or making an arrest based solely on perceived immigration status. It would also prevent government agencies from inquiring about immigration status when an individual seeks aid or reports a crime&#x2014;all policies that are already established in NYC. </p>

<p>It would also, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/520-14/mayor-bill-de-blasio-signs-law-bills-dramatically-reduce-new-york-city-s-cooperation-with#/0">NYC law</a>, prohibit law enforcement from detaining non-citizens in precincts, jails or prisons at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under some circumstances. Exceptions would include people previously convicted of a violent or Class A felony, or those on a federal terrorism watch list. Anyone facing deportation would be guaranteed legal representation. </p>

<p>Another Moya bill passed as part of the package, the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://www.nycbar.org/member-and-career-services/committees/reports-listing/reports/detail/report-in-support-of-the-one-day-to-protect-new-yorkers-act">One Day To Protect New Yorkers Act</a>,&quot; has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://www.nycbar.org/member-and-career-services/committees/reports-listing/reports/detail/report-in-support-of-the-one-day-to-protect-new-yorkers-act">endorsed by the New York City Bar</a> and immigration advocacy groups including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://www.immdefense.org/">Immigrant Defense Project</a>. The legislation would reduce the maximum sentence for an A misdemeanor from one year to 364 days, protecting non-citizens from federal legislation that allows deportation of individuals convicted of crimes with sentences of one year or longer. </p>

<p>&quot;The Assembly Majority believes that the continued success of our state depends on ensuring that immigrants have access to the resources they need to make meaningful contributions to their communities,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://assembly.state.ny.us/Press/20170206/">said</a> Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie ahead of the legislation&apos;s signing on Monday. &quot;Without the fear of inappropriate deportation and other serious consequences.&quot; </p>

<p>Also on Monday, the Assembly passed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://gothamist.com/tags/dreamact">Dream Act</a>, which would allow undocumented high school students in New York to apply for financial aid&#x2014;legislation that has passed five times in the Assembly, only to be killed in the Senate. Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/cuomo_middle_class_anger.php">recently endorsed the Dream Act</a>, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/nyregion/cuomo-might-cut-dream-act-from-state-budget.html?_r=0">dropping it last year</a> citing a lack of Senate support. </p>

<p>Both bills will likely face an uphill battle in the Senate, which is currently controlled by a conservative (and, admittedly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/forget_it_dave_its_albany.php">confusing</a>) coalition between Republicans and the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference [IDC]. </p>

<p>Spokeswoman Candice Giove said that the IDC would vote yes on both, but Republicans lashed out at the Liberty Act on Monday, and the New York State Conservative Party issued a memo urging a &apos;no&apos; vote on both bills.  </p>

<p>&quot;We pass laws for a reason&#x2014;we pass laws to protect the public,&quot; Republican Assemblyman Dean Murray of Long Island told Politico. &quot;Now we&apos;re asking our local law enforcement to just completely ignore some of those laws. That&apos;s a problem.&quot; </p>

<p>Republican Assemblyman Al Graf predicted that the bill would not pass the Senate, adding that he feared President Trump would make good on his threat to withhold funding. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ve seen the actions of the new president and I don&apos;t think he&apos;s bluffing when it comes to taking away federal money from the states,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-Assembly-Backs-Sanctuary-State-Policies-Despite-Risk-From-White-House-412992023.html">told NBC</a>.</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio praised the Assembly in a statement Monday, saying that the body &quot;voted today to protect the American Dream.&quot; </p>

<p>In recent weeks, immigration lawyers and advocates have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/27/sanctuary_city_nyc_trump.php">challenged the mayor for continuing to uphold &quot;broken windows&quot; policing</a>, which has been documented to draw an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022021030/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/broken_windows_still_racist.php">outsize number</a> of low-income people of color into the criminal justice system. According to President Trump&apos;s executive orders, non-citizens could be targeted for deportation for an arrest, even if the charge is ultimately dismissed. </p>

<p>Neither the established NYC immigrant protections, nor those proposed at the state level, would prohibit ICE from conducting business in New York. ICE is still &quot;a law enforcement agency with investigative ability,&quot; Camille Mackler, director of legal Initiatives for the New York Immigrant Coalition, told Gothamist earlier this month. </p>

<p>The Governor&apos;s Office did not immediately comment on the legislation. Nor did Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan. </p>
