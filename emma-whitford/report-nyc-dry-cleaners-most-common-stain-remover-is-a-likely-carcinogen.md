<p>The most commonly-used stain remover at New York City dry cleaners is a &quot;likely carcinogen&quot; according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and has been linked to headaches, dizziness and even liver and kidney failure among dry cleaner workers who are exposed to it on a daily basis. Crain&apos;s today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160508/SMALLBIZ/160509884/cheap-easy-and-dirty-the-toxic-chemical-new-yorks-dry-cleaners-cant-quit">published an in-depth investigation</a> into the dangers of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/https://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=22">perchloroethylene</a>, known as &apos;perc&apos; in the industry, which also poses health risks to New Yorkers who live above street-level dry cleaners. </p>

<p>The EPA launched perc regulation efforts in the early 1990s, but enforcement has been lax to date. And in New York City, where more than 60% of mom-and-pop dry cleaners are operated by Korean-American immigrants, upgrades to safer, environmentally-friendly compounds have proven cost-prohibitive. (It doesn&apos;t help that the dry cleaning industry as a whole is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/https://americandrycleaner.com/articles/drycleanings-decline-permanent">on the decline</a>, with fewer Americans buying clothing that calls for the service; the industry&apos;s overall revenue has dropped 13% in the last decade.)</p>

<p>Despite its lurid chemical makeup, the sweet-scented cleaning agent is highly effective at removing stains. &quot;The thing about perc is people really don&apos;t care,&quot; Daniel Lee, a dry cleaner owner on East 23rd Street, told Crain&apos;s. &quot;They want the job done right and don&apos;t care much about how it&apos;s done.&quot; </p>

<p>The EPA mandated in the mid-2000s that all dry cleaners that use perc <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904888304576472240509156636">vacate residential buildings by 2020</a>, but with the deadline fast approaching many New Yorkers are still exposed&#x2014;Crain&apos;s sites a 2009 study that identified 400 perc dry cleaners located in apartment buildings, exposing an estimated 2.3 million New Yorkers to the chemical. </p>

<p>The outlet also found that one in five of the 10,000 workers at 3,500 dry cleaners in New York City are exposed on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s a primmer on perc&#x2014;its pervasiveness and associated health risks, as well as governmental efforts to regulate it&#x2014;culled from Crain&apos;s reportage: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Perc is dangerous when inhaled heavily and consistently. Unfortunately, humans can&apos;t detect that sweet smell until concentration hits 6,000 micrograms per cubic meter, or about 200 times the recommended maximum. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>NYC dry cleaners are required to post a sign if they&apos;re using perc, but landlords are not legally obligated to notify tenants who live above dry cleaners of the associated health risks. A 2013 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/http://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-research">Environmental Research</a> study found an average of 106 micrograms per cubic meter in NYC apartments near dry cleaners&#x2014;more than triple the State Health Department&apos;s 30 microgram safety threshold. Children are more at risk than adults, since they &quot;inhale more air relative to their size.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>California <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/03/dry-cleaning-perc.html">ruled to ban perc</a> in 2007, but the law won&apos;t go into effect until 2023; New Jersey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/https://americandrycleaner.com/articles/new-jersey-issues-perc-phaseout-plan">considered a ban in 2008</a>, but dropped the idea amid considerable industry pushback. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>In 1997, New York State ruled that dry-cleaning machines had to be replaced with newer models that wash <em>and</em> dry clothes, so that workers would no longer have to carry containers of perc-soaked clothing between machines. But store owners were given until 2005 to make replacements; many of the perc machines used today are about 20 years old&#x2014;an age at which they start leaking fumes. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The City does not have an established system for regulating dry-cleaning emissions. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Many dry cleaners that advertise as &apos;eco-friendly&apos; use an alternative stain remover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/https://www.greenearthcleaning.com/">called Green Earth</a>, which is made up primarily of microscopic particles of sand. Experts say it&apos;s significantly safer, but D5, its active ingredient, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112820/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027323001530009X">has been linked to cancer in rats</a>. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The cost of replacing two dry-cleaner machines is estimated to be about $150,000&#x2014;a steep expenditure for a mom-and-pop shop. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Department of Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment on efforts to discourage the use of perc in residential buildings, ahead of the 2020 ban. The Department of Environmental Protection inspects dry-cleaners every three years, and workers are supposed to inspect machine vents on a daily basis to make sure perc isn&apos;t leaking. </p>

<p>&quot;We are concerned about the health of people who may have been exposed to perc and will continue to respond to residents concerned about possible exposure to elevated levels of perc,&quot; a DOH spokesman told Crain&apos;s. </p>
