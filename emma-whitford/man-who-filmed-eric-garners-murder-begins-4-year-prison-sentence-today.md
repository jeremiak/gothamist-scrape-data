<p>Twenty-five-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://gothamist.com/tags/RamseyOrta">Ramsey Orta</a>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">filmed</a> NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo putting Staten Island man Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold in July 2014, is beginning a four year prison sentence today, following a July plea deal. Orta made the plea on gun and drug charges that have accrued since his cellphone video went viral, sparking global condemnation of the NYPD. </p>

<p>The Staten Island activist and his attorneys have long attested that Orta&apos;s decision to film Garner&apos;s death put a target on his back. This morning Orta tweeted his distain for the NYPD, and posted a series of photographs with his young daughter. In them, he&apos;s wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the logo for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://www.copwatchnyc.org/">Copwatch</a>, the police watchdog group he joined after Garner&apos;s death. </p>

<p>&quot;[Hours after] Eric died, at 4am in the morning, there was a spotlight shining through my window. I looked out the window and there was a cop [police] car outside,&quot; Orta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/10/ny-man-filmed-eric-garner-death-heading-jail-161001074627241.html">told Al Jazeera last week</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;They parked outside my house and stopped people coming in and out of my house. That was going on until the day they ruled it [Garner&apos;s case] a homicide. I&apos;ve been arrested and let out many times. And now I am convicted of only two of seven cases.&quot;</p>

<p>Orta was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/04/man_who_filmed_nypds_fatal_chokehol.php">arrested in August 2014</a> for possession of a firearm, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2015/02/prosecutors_ramsey_orta_sold_d.html">then in February 2015</a> for allegedly selling drugs to undercover officers, and again in June 2015 for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/09/orta_still_targeted.php">allegedly selling MDMA to an undercover NYPD officer</a> on the Lower East Side. </p>

<p>Following the August 2014 arrest, Patrolmen&apos;s Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/police-union-president-ramsey-orta-arrested-witness-to-eric-garners-death-is-demonizing-the-good-work-of-police-officers-6700922">said</a>, &quot;It is criminals like Mr. Orta who carry illegal firearms who stand to benefit the most by demonizing the good work of police officers.&quot; </p>

<p>Orta&apos;s plea pertains to the gun arrest and the February 2015 drug arrest. </p>

<p>The February 2015 arrest landed Orta on Rikers for two months, while his family and friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/10/donovan_staten_island_republicans.php">crowdsourced</a> the full $16,250 necessary for bail. Even after he posted bail, Staten Island DA Daniel Donovan attempted to block Orta&apos;s release by requesting a bail source hearing. After the July arrest, the supposed MDMA was tested, and deemed fake. </p>

<p>In February of this year, Orta was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/22/garner_ramsey_orta_arrest.php">arrested after allegedly menacing his wife</a> Jessica Hollie (also an activist, a.k.a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/https://twitter.com/BellaEiko?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Bella Eiko</a>) with a knife and choking her during a domestic dispute. In the days following, Hollie launched an online campaign to raise bail money for Orta, and posted a video statement in her husband&apos;s defense, arguing that Orta has been &quot;harassed&quot; by the NYPD since publicizing the video of Garner&apos;s death, and that the February incident had been blown out of proportion. All related charges have since been dropped. </p>

<p>Orta had multiple arrests on his record before he filmed Garner&apos;s death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ramsey-orta-eric-garner_us_57a9edbde4b0aae2a5a15142">The Huffington Post reports</a> that he posted his rap sheet on Facebook earlier this year, showing 15 arrests since he turned 18, in 2010. Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://nypost.com/2015/02/10/man-who-shot-video-of-garner-death-busted-for-selling-drugs/">told the NY Post</a> in 2014 that Orta had 24 previous arrests, including rape. Orta&apos;s attorney Ken Perry disputed this number, but did not dispute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ramsey-orta-no-regrets-recording-eric-garner-video-article-1.2289979">a Daily News&apos; report</a> that Orta pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child when he was 18, for having sex with a 12-year-old. Perry told the Huffington Post that he believed releasing this kind of information to the press amounted to &quot;prosecutorial misconduct.&quot; </p>

<p>In an interview for the same Huffington Post profile, Orta said that his sleep is constantly punctuated with nightmares&#x2014;in which he is being strangled, or is running from police, or is shot by a person wearing a hooded sweatshirt. </p>

<p>&quot;Pretty much all my dreams are messed up,&quot; he told the outlet. &quot;I don&apos;t remember the last time I had a nice dream.&quot; </p>

<p>Orta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-filmed-eric-garner-fatal-2014-arrest-sues-nyc-10m-article-1.2727181">filed a $10 million lawsuit</a> against the city this summer, alleging that the arrests since Garner&apos;s death have been retaliation for his documentation of police brutality. </p>

<p>In August, a group of more than 40 documentarians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/10/filmmakers-citizen-journalists-justice-department-investigation">sent a letter</a> to the federal justice department, urging that body to investigate the harassment and &quot;targeting&quot; of citizen journalists&#x2014;Orta, as well as Chris LeDay and Abdullah Muflahi, who were detained after filming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/http://gothamist.com/tags/altonsterling">the death of Alton Sterling</a>, and Diamond &quot;Lavish&quot; Reynolds, who was detained after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/07/the-incredible-calm-of-diamond-lavish-reynolds/">filming the death of her boyfriend</a>, Philando Castile. </p>

<p>&quot;Mainstream media has paid ample attention to the images captured by these citizen journalists,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Largely, it has ignored the methods in which they were recorded and distributed, and the penalties for those involved.&quot; </p>

<p>An American Civil Liberties Union petition urging US Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate retaliation against citizen journalists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123116/https://action.aclu.org/secure/film-police">has 20,856 signatures</a> as of this writing. </p>

<p>[UPDATE 2:30]: William Aronin, one of Orta&apos;s attorneys for his criminal cases, said Monday, &quot;Ramsey made a choice, and we respect that decision. I know he is looking forward to putting this past him, and really looking forward to moving on with his life with a clean docket.&quot; </p>

<p>Aronin is not representing Orta on the civil lawsuit, and declined to comment on it. </p>
