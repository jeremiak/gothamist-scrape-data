title: Massive Verizon Outage Backed Up 1,500 Travelers At JFK On Sunday
---

	
										<p>As if snaking through TSA on a beautiful Sunday afternoon with hordes of miserable Memorial Day travelers weren&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/12/laguardia_breaks_us_all.php">cruel enough</a>, a massive Verizon service outage at JFK&apos;s Terminal 7 suspended all check-in systems yesterday, forcing more than a thousand travelers to stand on line for hours&#x2014;in many cases, to receive chicken scratch, pen-and-paper boarding passes. </p>

<p>Terminal 7 is operated by British Airways, and most of the impacted travelers were awaiting international flights. Lines maxed out at around 1,500 passengers hours after the 4:00 p.m. service breach, and had dwindled to about 80 fed up people by midnight on Monday. Port Authority spokesman Neal Buccino confirmed that service was back to normal by early Monday morning. </p>

<p>While British Airways declined to elaborate on the cause of the outage Monday, a letter from Cathay Pacific airlines&#x2014;which shares the terminal, along with Qantas and Iberia airlines&#x2014;blamed a &quot;current outage map for Verizon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They&#x2019;ve had to call everyone individually so it&#x2019;s quite disappointing,&#x201D; one passenger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134058/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/29/computer-system-shuts-down-at-jfk-terminal-7-passengers-say-airline-staff-handwriting-boarding-passes/">told CBS</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;They keep making announcements but you can&apos;t really hear them from out here,&quot; another added. &quot;So we&apos;re just doing what everyone else is doing.&quot; </p>

<p>Looks fun, huh? </p>

<p>&quot;We apologize for any inconvenience caused to our customers last night, as a result of a system outage at New York JFK airport,&quot; said a British Airways spokeswoman in a statement Monday morning. &quot;British Airways colleagues worked hard to assist customers during the outage to ensure all flights departed. The system providers worked overnight to resolve the issues, and things are now running again as normal.&quot; </p>

<p>The Port Authority stressed Monday that the issue was not TSA related, although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/tsa_lines_eternal_damnation.php">between budget cuts and increased security measures</a>, a normal day on the security line sets a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/13/video_tsa_security_checkpoint_see_it.php">pretty low bar</a>. </p>
