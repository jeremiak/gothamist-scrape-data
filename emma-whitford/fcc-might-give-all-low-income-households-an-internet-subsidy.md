<p>The Federal Communications Commission is moving forward on a plan to grant low-income families across the country a monthly $9.25 broadband subsidy, hopefully making studying for an exam, applying for a job, checking Facebook and researching say, healthcare providers, something less than cost-prohibitive. For context, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/technology/fcc-fine-tunes-plan-to-subsidize-internet-access.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">the NY Times reports</a> that internet costs $52.50/month on average in US cities. According to one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://broadbandnow.com/New-York/New-York">internet service aggregator</a>, internet in New York costs from $30/month. The FCC subsidy could result in monthly savings of about 20-30%. </p>

<p>The FCC&apos;s proposal is part of a $2 billion overhaul to a federal program called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/https://www.windstream.com/About-Us/Lifeline-Assistance-Program/">Lifeline</a>, which was established back in the 1980s to subsidize landline service for low-income families. To qualify, participants must make 135% of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines">national poverty level</a> or less (that&apos;s about $16,000/year for an individual), or already receive federal aid like Medicaid or food stamps. Republican legislators have been historically stingy when it comes to Lifeline&#x2014;in 2008, the program was expanded to subsidize wireless service as well, and some families began <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://www.wftv.com/news/local/9-investigates-abuse-free-cellphone-program-lifeli/107318289">billing double for subsidies</a>, even though they were only technically allotted one. &quot;Before again expanding the program, we need to consider what problems remain and how we can address them,&quot; Republican Senator Roger Wicker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/technology/republicans-resist-fcc-proposal-for-lifeline-broadband-subsidies.html">said over the summer</a>. But the NY Times points out that the FCC commissioners have a democratic majority, and are likely to pass the measure. </p>

<p>In New York City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/28/ok_kiosk.php#photo-1">&quot;super fast&quot; wifi kiosks</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/nyc_free_wifi_test.php">are proliferating</a> on sidewalks, and a Governor with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/penn_station_renovation.php">many</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/laguardia_reboot_ferry.php">grand</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/monorail.php">ambitions</a> is promising <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/subway_facelift_shutdown.php">Wi-Fi throughout the subway</a>. Meanwhile, a recent report from the Center for Economic Opportunity found that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://nypost.com/2015/07/16/city-to-spend-10m-providing-housing-developments-with-free-internet/">22% of households</a> don&apos;t have internet access. </p>

<p>The FCC is expected to vote on the proposed subsidy on March 31st. </p>

<p>Last summer, Mayor de Blasio committed $10 million to equip the Mott Haven Houses in the Bronx, the Red Hook Houses in Brooklyn, and the Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City with <em>free</em> broadband, with the latter coming online &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720213624/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/17/nycha_broadband_internet.php">as soon as</a>&quot; this year.</p>
