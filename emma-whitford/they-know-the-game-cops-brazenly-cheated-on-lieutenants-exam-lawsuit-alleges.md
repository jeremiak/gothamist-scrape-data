<p>NYPD sergeants who took a makeup exam to move up to lieutenant status last summer had access to an answer key posted on a popular message board for NYPD officers, according to a lawsuit being filed today in Manhattan Supreme Court. </p>

<p>The suit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200931/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-suit-nypd-lieutenants-exam-cheat-sheet-article-1.2575728">first reported</a> by the Daily News, includes excerpts from posts on the message board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200931/http://risingstarpromotion.activeboard.com/">Rising Star</a>, including a photograph posted May 13th of an answer key that the suit alleges is accurate, and still online. On May 18th, user Tavares91 posted, &quot;[If] you need the exact wording of a specific question, message me the question number and I will send it to you!&#x201D;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, NYPD sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200931/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/criminal-justice/2016/03/9/nypd-investigates-whether-some-sergeants-cheated-on-promotions-exam.html">told NY1</a> that cheating is so common on the lieutenant exam that some officers intentionally skip the original test date in order to schedule a makeup test and access an answer key in the meantime. &quot;Many people, they know the game,&quot; an anonymous sergeant told the outlet. &quot;If they call out sick or if they, what we call line of duty, they get injured on the job prior to the exam, that is their excuse for taking a make-up exam.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the 2,400 sergeants who took the Department of Citywide Administrative Services&apos;s  lieutenant exam as-scheduled last year, 164 passed&#x2014;about 6.8%. Of the 80 sergeants who took the makeup exam, 48% passed. </p>

<p>&quot;What it appears we have uncovered is that this is not an isolated incident,&quot; said attorney Randolph McLaughlin. &quot;Certainly someone who cheats should not be promoted.&quot; </p>

<p>NYPD lieutenants make upwards of $200,000 per year, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200931/http://seethroughny.net/payrolls/city-of-new-york">SeeThroughNY</a>. Their responsibilities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200931/https://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/downloads/pdf/noes/201101534000.pdf">include</a> commanding a platoon and overseeing general and special operations, coordinating responses to a crime scene, and disciplining subordinates. </p>

<p>The NYPD&apos;s Internal Affairs Bureau has confirmed that it is investigating the makeup test. In the meantime, the sergeants&apos; suit is calling for a department-wide freeze on promotions. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200931/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/09/nypd_officer_who_taught_cpr_class_f.php">stripped an academy CPR instructor of her badge</a> after a former NYPD officer who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200931/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/21/akai_gurley_lawsuit.php">fatally shot an innocent man</a> in Brooklyn testified in court that he only &quot;sort of&quot; received CPR training in her class. According to the NYPD, an investigation into allegedly lax CPR instruction is ongoing. </p>
