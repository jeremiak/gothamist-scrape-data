<p>A teenager crashed his Acura on Atlantic Avenue in Queens early Sunday morning and fled the scene, leaving his seriously injured brother in the wrecked passenger seat, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>Cops are still searching for 19-year-old Aidan Camacho, a spokesman for the department confirmed Monday. His passenger, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052802/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/police-hunt-queens-hit-and-run-driver-passenger-badly-hurt-article-1.2996089">identified by the NY Daily News</a> as 21-year-old Angel Camacho, remains in critical condition at Jamaica Hospital. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="031317_crash.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052802im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/031317_crash.jpeg" width="320" height="552"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> (DCPI)</i></div> Police responded to the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and 85th Street, on the border of Ozone Park and Woodhaven, around 4:15 a.m. on Sunday. There, they found a 21-year-old man, apparently Angel, in the passenger seat of a totaled 2008 Acura. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052802/http://nypost.com/2017/03/12/driver-flees-crash-scene-leaves-passenger-injured-cops/">The NY Post reports</a> that the man had suffered head trauma and sustained internal injuries. <p></p>

<p>According to a preliminary investigation, Camacho was driving west on Atlantic Avenue, in the left lane, when he &quot;lost control&quot; and struck a parked car and a tree. He fled the scene before cops arrived, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>Sources told the NY Post that Camacho jumped into a passing car after the crash. He was then dropped at Interfaith Hospital, according to the tabloid, but fled. </p>

<p>Camacho was last seen wearing a white hooded sweatshirt and dark pants. He is believed to be about 5&apos;8&quot; and 130 pounds. </p>

<p>City Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052802/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/rodriguez_hit_and_run_alert_system.php">sponsoring legislation</a> to hold hit-and-run drivers accountable, following a spate of such crashes in early January. One law would create a hit-and-run reward fund with up to $1,000 for information leading to arrest, prosecution or conviction. Another would launch an alert system, similar to AMBER Alert, to notify New Yorkers every time a hit-and-run incident occurs.</p>
