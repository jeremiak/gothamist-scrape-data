<p>Lower East Siders and community leaders gathered outside 45 Rivington Street on Wednesday morning to protest its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/les_luxury_condos_everywhere.php">imminent conversion</a> from a nursing home into 100 luxury condominium units, and demand that Mayor de Blasio compensate the neighborhood for what they perceive to be at best a massive governmental oversight, and at worst an example of real estate interests exploiting their connections to City Hall. </p>

<p>Until the fall of 2015, 45 Rivington Street was under a deed restriction that required it remain a nonprofit residential healthcare facility &quot;in perpetuity.&quot; The 118-year-old building on the corner of Forsyth Street served first as a public school, and then, for decades, as a nursing home for AIDS patients. </p>

<p>That restriction was lifted in November 2015, so quietly that many local leaders say they knew nothing of it. Last December, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2015/12/followup-city-cleared-the-way-for-luxury-housing-at-former-rivington-street-nursing-home.html">confirmed to the Lo Down</a> that the building&apos;s then-owners, a for-profit nursing home provider called Allure Group, had paid the city $16.15 million to lift the deed. In March, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.vanke.com/en/">China Vanke Co.</a>, the largest real estate developer in China, closed a $116 million deal on the property with Slate Property Group and Adam America Real Estate. </p>

<p>&quot;The whole notion of a deed restriction is that a luxury housing developer doesn&apos;t swoop in and take the property away from the community,&quot; said Borough President Gale Brewer on Wednesday, noting a shortage of nursing home facilities in the LES. </p>

<p>The Mayor could replace the 200 lost nursing home beds with a new community center, she argued, or new hospice, shelter, or supportive housing beds. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio has denied that he was aware of any inter-agency agreements that facilitated lifting the deed restriction on 45 Rivington. According to Mayoral spokeswoman Karen Hinton, the lifting of such a restriction is only necessarily brought to the attention of the Mayor&apos;s Office of Contract Services general counsel, which signs off on such decisions in a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/04/8595710/mayor-said-he-would-have-blocked-rivington-deal-if-hed-known">very pro forma way</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>According to Deputy Mayor Anthony Shorris, those with knowledge of the deal in the Mayor&apos;s office had been led to believe that the building would become a for-profit nursing home once it was out from under City-imposed restrictions. &quot;The city was as disappointed as local residents to [learn] that the property would no longer provide needed health services,&quot; Austin Finan, a Mayoral spokseman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.wsj.com/articles/manhattan-land-deal-is-examined-1458694201">told the Wall Street Journal</a> last month. </p>

<p>De Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/04/8595710/mayor-said-he-would-have-blocked-rivington-deal-if-hed-known">told reporters this week</a> that, &quot;If they [members of my administration] had informed me [of the agreement] I would&apos;ve said &apos;don&apos;t do it.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>But Community Board 3 Chair Gigi Li said on Wednesday that she sent a letter to the Mayor on January 27th, after neighbors informed CB3 that they were being approached by developers on the street. 45 Rivington&apos;s previous owner, Village Care, had requested CB3&apos;s support in altering the deed restriction a year previous, so the locals were suspicious. &quot;Our explicit request was that if a deed restriction had been lifted, every effort needed to be made to reverse it,&quot; Li said. &quot;And that [45 Rivington] needs to remain a community facility.&quot; The letter got no response. </p>

<p>Hinton told Politico this week that while the city&apos;s Community Affairs Unit heard complaints from CB3, &quot;no one understood the implications fully until late February.&quot;</p>

<p>The Department of Investigation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2016/03/comptroller-investigates-citys-role-in-sale-of-former-rivington-house-facility.html">Comptroller Scott Stringer&apos;s office</a> and, most recently, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/attorney-general-subpoenas-rivington-house-developer-article-1.2590272">Attorney General&apos;s office</a> have all launched investigations into what happened. </p>

<p>In the meantime, details of the negotiation keep getting knottier. The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-lobbyist-helped-turn-nursing-home-condos-article-1.2578230?cid=bitly">reported last week</a> that lobbyist James Capalino, who represented Village Care (which sold 45 Rivington to Allure Group in 2014 for $28 million) before moving to Slate Group, has bundled $50,000 in donations to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/22/de_blasio_shadow_govmnt.php">Campaign for One New York</a>, which support&apos;s the Mayor&apos;s 2017 reelection efforts. The donations started coming in last October, about a month before the deed restriction was lifted. (A spokeswoman for Capalino has since denied that Capalino &quot;represented Slate&quot; in the Rivington deal; Hinton reiterated that the Mayor &quot;has never discussed the sale with anyone, including Mr. Capalino.&quot;) </p>

<p>Councilmember Margaret Chin today announced that she is introducing legislation that would mandate radical transparency in all deed negotiations that could change a city-imposed restriction on a building&apos;s use. The legislation would require public notice well before the city considers lifting a deed restriction, and mandate a new online database including property records for all NYC buildings that are subject to the City&apos;s deed restrictions. </p>

<p>Until recently, announcements of deed restriction negotiations were only listed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/">City Record</a>. In the case of 45 Rivington, the NY Times reports, public notice of a hearing on the deed changes was listed in the Record for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/nyregion/nursing-homes-sale-to-condo-developer-raises-questions-for-city.html?_r=1">one day</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/downloads/pdf/cityrecord/cityrecord-05-11-15.pdf">May 11, 2015</a>. </p>

<p>According to the Mayor&apos;s office, DCAS mandated on March 1 that going forward, notice will be made &quot;not only in the City Record but to the affected Borough President, Council Member, and Community Board.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Really, it needs to be the law,&quot; Brewer challenged on Wednesday. &quot;We need to do more. I can&apos;t tell you how many properties there are in this City with deed restrictions, or where those buildings are. Transparency is needed.&quot; </p>

<p>Aurora Guzman, 48, has lived on the Lower East Side for 35 years. &quot;We have homeless in the streets, and veterans who don&apos;t have a place to stay and have a very hard time getting medical attention,&quot; she said. &quot;Politicians are not always very transparent in their deals. I think they... are really trying hard to make this city a city for a certain population.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Mayor is considering all legal options against Allure to determine if some kind of restitution can be made on behalf of the community,&quot; said Hinton on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear what form that compensation might take. </p>

<p>Allure Group came forward with its first statement since the condo sale on Monday. &quot;We tried to make Rivington House viable as a for-profit skilled nursing facility,&quot; Marvin Rubin, a partner at Allure, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016132843/http://www.wsj.com/articles/firm-denies-wrongdoing-in-new-york-city-deed-controversy-1459816460">told WSJ</a>. &quot;When it became clear that this was not possible, we followed all proper protocols and sold the building.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>CORRECTION:</strong> An earlier version of this piece said that the deed restriction was lifted in June 2015. It was in fact lifted in November 2015. </p>
