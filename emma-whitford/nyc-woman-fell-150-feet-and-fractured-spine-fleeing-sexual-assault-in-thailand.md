<p>A 23-year-old Queens woman traveling in Southern Thailand fell about 150 feet down a seaside cliff and fractured her spine while fleeing a man accused of sexually assaulting her near a beach popular with tourists and backpackers. </p>

<p>Hannnah Michel Gavios, 23, of Bayside, was attacked around 11:00 p.m. on Thursday, September 1st, Tourist Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152538/http://www.thephuketnews.com/american-woman-fleeing-sexual-advances-survives-horror-fall-in-krabi-58962.php#DYj4TlqMy6RHG8Pk.97">told Phucket News</a>, an English language news outlet. Gavios <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152538/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3775721/American-tourist-breaks-falling-150ft-cliff-fleeing-sex-attacker-Thai-beauty-spot-asked-directions.html">later told the Daily Mail</a> that she had gotten lost on Railay Beach after dark, and walked into a nearby tourist shop to ask for directions back to her hotel. According to Gavios&apos;s account, a man inside the shop offered to show her the way, and proceeded to lead her into a forested area, up a steep path. </p>

<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t get the best feeling about him but I was tired and wanted to get home,&quot; she told the Daily Mail. &quot;I&apos;d been traveling for 16 hours so I guess I wasn&apos;t feeling myself.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;While we were walking he grabbed me and was holding me down and trying to take off my clothes,&quot; she added. Before she ran off into the dark and fell: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;I started punching him in the face and beating him up and biting off his ear. I was biting his ear so hard it almost came off. His ear was half torn off... 

<p>He was in pain and asked me to stop, so we shook hands and he stopped but I was still nervous and he was still trying to harass me so there was no choice but to run. I started walking back to where I came from. Once there was distance between us I started running.&quot; </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>According to Gavios, the alleged attacker came down the cliff after her, and swung between expressing concern&#x2014;at one point she said he made a phone call, apparently for help&#x2014;and molesting her. &quot;He got on top of me. He took of his pants and masturbated on me,&quot; she said. &quot;He didn&apos;t rape me but he did everything else. I really thought I was going to die.&quot; </p>

<p>A call reportedly came in to police from Railay Beach, a peninsula near the southern city of Krabi, late Thursday. Police searched overnight and discovered Gavios on Saturday. According to Phucket News, Gavious told police that both of her legs were numb, and that she had fallen while attempting to escape a man who was harassing her. </p>

<p>&quot;Officials received a call reporting that a tourist had been injured after she had fallen down a mountain in the Railay area,&quot; Nitiphat Mongkolpradit, director of the Krabi Tourist Rescue Center, told Phucket News. </p>

<p>&quot;Rescue workers were searching for her last night, but they could not find her, so this morning we when out to search again and discovered her lying in between rocks about 45 meters from the trail at the top of the mountain. She was only 15 meters from the water below.&quot; </p>

<p>Haad Nopparathara National Park told Phucket News Friday that a suspect had been taken into custody&#x2014;one Apai Raingworn, 28, who allegedly &quot;admitted that he had made sexual advances toward a tourist while taking her from Railay to Tonsai.&quot; According to the Daily Mail, Raingworn eventually led rescue crews to the scene on Friday morning, and showed police the spot where Gavios had fallen. </p>

<p>Local police told reporters that Raingworn had scratches on his body. </p>

<p>Gavios studied graphic design at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, according to Facebook, and posted about a new job teaching English with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152538/http://www.gel.co.tz/index.php/about-gel/welcome-to-gel">Global Education Link</a> [GEL] on August 7th.
