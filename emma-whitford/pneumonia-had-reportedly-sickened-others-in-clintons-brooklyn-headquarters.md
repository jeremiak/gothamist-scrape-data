<p>The case of pneumonia that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/11/hillary_clinton_left_sept_11th_memo.php">caused Hillary Clinton to stumble</a> as she abruptly left a 9/11 memorial ceremony on Sunday morning reportedly hit her Brooklyn campaign headquarters late last month and took out at least six members of her senior staff. </p>

<p>A campaign source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://www.people.com/article/hillary-clinton-staff-sick-pneumonia">told People magazine</a> after Sunday&apos;s incident that &quot;everyone&apos;s been sick,&quot; and that two advisors often in Clinton&apos;s company ended up seeking emergency medical treatment. At least one collapsed from &quot;severe dehydration&quot; and was rushed to the ER. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/775080366671597572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">a statement Sunday night</a>, Clinton&apos;s longtime physician Dr. Lisa Bardack described similar symptoms. Confirming that Clinton had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, she said that the presidential nominee &quot;became overheated and dehydrated.&quot; </p>

<p>The doctor&apos;s statement came hours after Clinton&apos;s public near-collapse, leaving a big window for speculation&#x2014;especially considering Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-clintons-cough-is-not-appropriate-to-discuss-bu?utm_term=.ynBXaV0Vjl#.lfZWENBNO3">recent insinuations</a> about Clinton&apos;s coughing. The Republican nominee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/773181751749402624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">wondered on Twitter</a> last week &quot;what&apos;s up&quot; with Clinton&apos;s &quot;massive &apos;hacking&apos; or coughing attack,&quot; prompting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/21/asdfasdfasdf.php">a new conspiracy movement</a>. (Far-right conspiracy theorists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2FxYHfKyWk">have been questioning Clinton&apos;s health for years</a>.) </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not the end of the world&#x2014;I think she&apos;s OK&#x2014;but it ain&apos;t good,&quot; a person close to the Clintons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-health-trump-228008">told Politico</a> shortly after the nominee left her daughter Chelsea&apos;s Manhattan apartment on Sunday. &quot;It adds a new, unwelcome element.&quot; </p>

<p>Reporters on the campaign trail also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-has-pneumonia-doctor-says-228012">accused Hillary&apos;s camp</a> of dishonesty, criticizing them for waiting several days to reveal her pneumonia diagnosis. A 10:00 a.m. statement on Sunday said that Clinton had &quot;departed to go to her daughter&apos;s apartment, and is feeling much better&quot;; Clinton herself said only that she was &quot;feeling great&quot; when she left Chelsea&apos;s apartment. </p>

<p>Clinton&apos;s campaign canceled her Monday and Tuesday events, which included fundraising in California and appearing on the Ellen DeGeneres show, late Sunday. </p>

<p>Trump didn&apos;t add much fuel to the conspiracy fire on Monday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://abc7ny.com/politics/hillary-clintons-pneumonia-fuels-questions-about-her-health/1507743/">telling Fox News</a> that he hopes &quot;she gets well and gets back on the trail and we&apos;ll be seeing her at the debate.&quot; </p>

<p>But the Republican nominee, who the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/donald-trump-diet.html?_r=0">recently diagnosed</a> as the candidate &quot;hoping to become the nation&#x2019;s fast food president&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/05/picture_trumps_lower_intestine.php">taco bowl</a>, anyone? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170428091652/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/760299757206208512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">KFC</a>?) <em>is</em> expected to reveal detailed results of his latest physical examination later this week, on Dr. Oz. </p>

<p>&quot;I think they&apos;re going to be good,&quot; he said on Fox and Friends this morning. &quot;I feel great.&quot; </p>
