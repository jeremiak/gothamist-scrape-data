<p>On a chilly morning in early April, Lower East Siders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/45_rivington_press_conference.php">stood outside 45 Rivington Street</a> to protest the red brick building&apos;s impending conversion from a nursing home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/les_luxury_condos_everywhere.php">into 100 luxury condominium units</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2016/03/comptroller-investigates-citys-role-in-sale-of-former-rivington-house-facility.html">City</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/attorney-general-subpoenas-rivington-house-developer-article-1.2590272">state</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/deblasio_45_rivington_preet.php">federal</a> investigators have since launched probes into the deal. Mayor de Blasio has denied <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/04/mayor-said-he-would-have-blocked-rivington-deal-if-hed-known-033097">repeatedly</a> that he was aware of his office lifting a protective deed restriction on the building, and his press team has stated that no more deeds will be altered until the city&apos;s procedures are straightened out. </p>

<p>But gathering across the street from 45 Rivington on Monday, neighbors, elected officials, and former Rivington House patients said they&apos;re still waiting for any indication that the Mayor will step in and reverse the deed lift, re-establishing 45 Rivington Street as a healthcare facility in perpetuity. </p>

<p>&quot;We want the place back,&quot; said Tessa Huxley, president of coop adjacent to Rivington House, where she&apos;s lived since 1981. &quot;I don&apos;t need anyone to be punished, just give us back our facility. It&apos;s been a complete, deafening silence from the mayor.&quot;  </p>

<p>The 118-year-old, 200-bed building on the corner of Forsyth Street served first as a public school, and then, for decades, as a nursing home for AIDS patients. Locals say that while there may be fewer AIDS patients now than there were in the &apos;80s and &apos;90s, the need for local nursing homes is acute. </p>

<p>&quot;The only way people can keep a grasp on their community is to still live in it when they are older,&quot; Huxley added. </p>

<p>Last fall, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2015/12/followup-city-cleared-the-way-for-luxury-housing-at-former-rivington-street-nursing-home.html">lifted a deed restriction</a> on 45 Rivington that would have required it remain a nonprofit residential healthcare facility &quot;in perpetuity.&quot; In exchange, the building&apos;s then-owners, a for-profit nursing home provider called Allure Group, paid the city $16.15 million. In March, China Vanke Co., the largest real estate developer in China, closed a $116 million deal on the property with Slate Property Group and Adam America Real Estate.</p>

<p>&quot;We had protections in place, and look at where we are,&quot; said James Rodriguez of the local housing preservation nonprofit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://www.goles.org/">Good Old Lower East Side</a> on Monday. &quot;It really speaks to the state of development in this neighborhood&#x2026;. We&apos;re really beset on all sides here.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We need common space where the most vulnerable can be safe and actually be cared for when their families can&apos;t care for them themselves,&quot; added Michael, whose father lived at Rivington House for 8 years until his death in 2009 (Michael asked that his last name be withheld because his father was not public about his HIV diagnosis). &quot;Rivington House was a monument to compassion. Now we&apos;re going to give it up for 16 million dollars. Really?&quot; </p>

<p>A newly-formed coalition called Community Voices To Save Rivington House has also compiled a booklet of quotes from locals and former patients demanding that the healthcare facility be restored, which Huxley says is being sent to the mayor&apos;s office this week. </p>

<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/https://www.change.org/p/mayor-deblasio-return-rivington-house-to-the-les?recruiter=547457291">online petition</a> urging the mayor to intervene and give Rivington back to the community has 1,326 signatures as of this writing. &quot;This neighborhood doesn&apos;t need more investments opportunities for the wealthy,&quot; it states. &quot;We need affordable, supportive homes for our community&apos;s most vulnerable.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="062716_Rivington1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/062716_Rivington1.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Workers removing furniture from 45 Rivington Street in May (via Tessa Huxley). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Huxley called into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://www.wnyc.org/story/askthemayor-de-blasio/">Brian Lehrer&apos;s weekly #AskTheMayor segment</a> in May, and asked de Blasio directly if he would restore the facility. </p>

<p>&quot;What I want to know is how you and your team can save this beautiful [building], which was converted from a public school with public dollars, and make sure that it can be a neighborhood medical facility, such as a nursing home,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>The Mayor proceeded to describe his office&apos;s efforts to improve deed restriction protections moving forward, until Lehrer urged him to answer the question at hand. &quot;We are exploring that question right now,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;As soon as I can say more to the community about what can happen on that site, I will.&quot; </p>

<p>45 Rivington has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110085640/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/08/stop_work_order_issued_for_les_nurs.php">under a stop work order</a> since April 8th. At the time, a Department of Buildings spokesperson said that design plans for the new condos called for major building alterations that the construction permit did not cover.</p>

<p>In May, Huxley and her neighbors documented workers pulling furniture out of the building and crushing it. &quot;Even if we get the building back,&quot; Huxley said, &quot;It will be completely empty.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
