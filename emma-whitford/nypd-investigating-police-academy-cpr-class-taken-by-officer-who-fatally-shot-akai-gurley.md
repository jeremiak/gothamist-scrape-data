<p>NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton told reporters on Tuesday that his department is currently investigating the Police Academy CPR class taken by Peter Liang&#x2014;the former NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233927/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/11/nypd_cop_found_verdict.php">convicted this month</a> of manslaughter and official misconduct in the shooting death of Brooklyn man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233927/http://gothamist.com/tags/akaigurley">Akai Gurley</a>. </p>

<p>Liang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233927/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/21/akai_gurley_lawsuit.php">shot Gurley</a> while performing a vertical patrol of the Pink Houses in East New York in November of 2014. Bratton immediately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233927/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/nyregion/new-york-police-officer-fatally-shoots-brooklyn-man.html">declared the shooting an accident</a>, and called Gurley, who was unarmed, a &quot;total innocent.&quot; </p>

<p>When Liang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233927/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/liang_weeps_testimony_gurley.php">took to the witness stand</a> in Brooklyn Supreme Court earlier this month, he testified that his CPR training had been minimal. </p>

<p>&quot;Did you learn CPR at the police academy?&quot; Liang&apos;s attorney, Rae Koshetz, asked her client on the stand. Liang replied that he &quot;sort of&quot; had, adding that his class had been fed the answers by the police academy instructor. He also testified that he had never been trained for CPR with a dummy.</p>

<p>&quot;Under no circumstances will we tolerate any instructor in the New York City Police Department short-circuiting the process for this instruction,&quot; Bratton said on Tuesday, adding that &quot;literally within a half hour of that testimony being made, Internal Affairs initiated [an] investigation.&quot; </p>

<p>Bratton described the CPR investigation as &quot;very extensive&quot; on Tuesday, and said that all of the officers who took the class are being interviewed &quot;very intimately&quot; about the statements made in court. He added that results of the investigation would be made public. </p>

<p>According to court testimony, Liang didn&apos;t know that he had shot Gurley until he and his partner, Officer Shaun Landau, came across Gurley&apos;s girlfriend Melissa Butler administering CPR on a lower stairwell landing. The officers allegedly spent several minutes arguing over whether to alert superiors that Liang had fired his weapon. Meanwhile, Butler called 911. In court, Butler testified that &quot;the Asian officer was doing nothing the whole time.&quot; </p>

<p>Liang also testified in court that he &quot;never really touched&quot; his firearm training manual, and that he primarily learned about firearm safety from Powerpoint presentations. However, Bratton did not allude to any investigation into firearm safety training on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the CPR investigation will extend beyond Liang&apos;s CPR class, and if the NYPD has plans to investigate firearm training as well. </p>
