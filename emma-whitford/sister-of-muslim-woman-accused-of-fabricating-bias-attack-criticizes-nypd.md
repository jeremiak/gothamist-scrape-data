This photo was released to the press when Seweid went missing for two days last week (via NYPD). </i></div> The sister of an 18-year-old Muslim woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161845/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/14/muslim_subway_bias_attack.php">charged Wednesday</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161845/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/02/trumps_amerikkka.php">fabricating</a> a bias attack on the 6 train wrote a message in defense of her sister on Thursday morning. <p></p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know why Yasmin lied about what happened, but I know that for some reason she thought that making up the story was going to get her out of some trouble,&quot; Sara Seweid wrote on Facebook, in a post that has since been deleted. </p>

<p>Seweid, who could not immediately be reached for further comment, went on to criticize the NYPD for leaking details about her sister&apos;s personal life to the press, and for allegedly exhibiting anti-Muslim bias during the investigation. She also accused reporters of disseminating inaccurate information, and criticized the charges: obstructing governmental administration and falsely reporting an incident, which are both misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in prison.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You don&apos;t think calling for an 18 year old girl to be jailed for lying to be violent and abhorrent?&quot; she wrote.</p>

According to the tabloid, her Egyptian parents were upset with her becoming &quot;Westernized,&quot; and for dating a Catholic. Courtroom photographers captured Seweid during her arraignment, her head shaved. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161845/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/muslim-woman-reported-trump-supporter-attack-made-story-article-1.2910944">The Daily News</a> reported that the buzz was allegedly part of a punishment mandated by her parents. </p>

<p>Seweid initially told police that she had been the victim of an anti-Muslim bias attack on the subway on Wednesday, December 1st. According to her account, three intoxicated men followed her onto an uptown 6 train at 23rd Street around 10:00 p.m. that night. She said they began to scream xenophobic insults at her and eventually grabbed her purse and tried to pull off her hijab. Seweid reported the alleged incident to police when she exited the train at Grand Central.</p>

<p>&quot;I was harassed on the subway last night and it was just so dehumanizing I can&apos;t speak about it without getting emotional,&quot; Seweid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161845/https://www.facebook.com/yasmine.seweid/posts/1394774770568870">wrote on Facebook</a> following her initial report to police. &quot;It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trump[&apos;s] America is real and I witnessed it firsthand last night!&quot; Seweid added. &quot;Please stay safe everyone &amp; never let anyone take your rights away.&quot;</p>

<p>Investigators had difficulty finding witnesses or suspects. &quot;No witnesses came forward,&quot; an NYPD spokesman said Thursday, adding that police had been &quot;working diligently&quot; on the case. Then Seweid, who lives in New Hyde Park, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161845/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/10/muslim_teen_who_was_allegedly_attac.php">reported missing</a> for two days, prompting an investigation from the Nassau County PD.</p>

<p>An NYPD source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218161845/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/muslim-woman-reported-trump-supporter-attack-made-story-article-1.2910944?utm_content=bufferf0b6c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">told the Daily News</a> that Seweid&apos;s disappearance heightened investigators&apos; mounting suspicions about her allegations.</p>

<p>Seweid retracted her story on Wednesday. An NYPD source told Gothamist that Seweid allegedly fabricated the story to avoid getting into trouble with her family. &quot;She stated that she lied for the purpose of not getting into trouble with her parents for coming home late,&quot; the source said. &quot;She also said that she made up the story so that her father wouldn&apos;t yell at her.&quot; </p>

<p>Seweid, who has no prior arrests on her record, was arrested around 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon at 19 Pitt Street on the Lower East Side. She was arraigned and released without bail early Thursday morning. </p>

<p>Seweid&apos;s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. </p>
