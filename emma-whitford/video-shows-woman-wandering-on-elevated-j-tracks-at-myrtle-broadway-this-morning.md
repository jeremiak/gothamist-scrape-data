<p>A woman in a long, patterned coat stepped off of the train platform at Myrtle/Broadway in Bed-Stuy on Wednesday morning and started walking in the direction of Manhattan, according to multiple witnesses. <br>
  <br>
&quot;She stepped on the tracks at Myrtle/Broadway and walked very casually down the exact middle of the track,&quot; Gabbie Robbins, a 25-year-old office manager, told Gothamist. &quot;She&apos;s probably at Lorimer by now.&quot; </p>

<p>Robbins said that the woman didn&apos;t seem distressed when wandered onto the tracks shortly before 9:00 a.m. At one point, she appeared to look at her cellphone. &quot;She seemed totally fine and very confident about her decision to walk on the tracks,&quot; Robbins said. &quot;I have absolutely no idea why.&quot; </p>

<p>According to Robbins, commuters on the platform were &quot;all really surprised and quiet&quot; when the woman stepped off of the platform. Afterwards, a straphanger used the station &quot;help point&quot; to call the MTA.</p>

<p>MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said that police removed an emotionally disturbed person from the tracks this morning, and that normal service was restored by 9:13 a.m. The NYPD did not immediately have details on the incident. </p>
