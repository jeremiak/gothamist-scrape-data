<p>Officers from the NYPD&apos;s Special Operations unit rescued a red-tailed hawk that had managed to wedge itself between two panes of glass at an Upper East Side apartment this afternoon, maneuvering the bird of prey into a cat carrier by its talons. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re wondering how many cops are called in on this kind of mission, we count <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923062852/https://twitter.com/NYPD19Pct/status/742415780277571584">at least 6</a>!</p>
