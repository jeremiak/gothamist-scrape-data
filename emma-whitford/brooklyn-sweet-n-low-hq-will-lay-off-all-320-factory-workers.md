<p>Last Friday, manufacturing and packaging workers at the Sweet&apos;N Low factory in Fort Greene were called in for a company-wide meeting, and informed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023041553/http://cpack.com/">Cumberland Packing Company</a> CEO Steven Eisenstadt that all 320 factory jobs at the sugar and sweetener company&apos;s Navy Yard headquarters would be nullified by year&apos;s end. </p>

<p>The factory, where artificial sweeteners have been mixed since the late 1950s and where Sugar in the Raw, Stevia, and Sweet&apos;N Low are packaged and shipped internationally, will be shut down. Tasks performed by the local workforce&#x2014;two thirds of current employees live in Brooklyn, and a third in Queens&#x2014;will be entirely outsourced to what Cumberland has since described as &quot;domestic &#x2018;co-packing&#x2019; companies,&quot; or second-party factories. </p>

<p>&quot;It hit me like a brick,&quot; said Delbert Ranger, 52, on his lunch break on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Ranger lives in Bed-Stuy, and has worked for Cumberland for six years, operating a machine that packages Sugar in the Raw. He currently makes $9.92 an hour, which goes towards his $1,200/month rent, child support for his son, and care for his elderly mother.  &quot;Some people are still in denial that this is going to happen,&quot; he added. &quot;They&apos;ve worked 10, 20 years at the company and had hopes of retiring from this company.&quot; </p>

<p>Cumberland confirmed that it will keep its headquarters in Brooklyn. &quot;This borough and this city will always be our home,&quot; said Eisenstadt in a statement. &quot;As we move out of manufacturing, Cumberland will hone our focus on product development, marketing, distribution and sales here. Our corner of the industry has incredible competition that&apos;s changing our business model.&quot; </p>

<p>Cumberland received approximately $4 million in incentives from the city back in 2007, designated for renovating two of its Brooklyn Navy Yard buildings. As a stipulation of this agreement, Cumberland was required to maintain a workforce of at least 320&#x2014;but only until 2011. Company headquarters are required to stay in-borough until 2020. </p>

<p>&quot;Cumberland... kept the packing operations running in-house long after the scope of these incentives ended,&quot; said a company spokesperson this afternoon. &quot;The repair work that funds paid for to keep the buildings from crumbling down and the floors from falling in will benefit whoever moves into the space next.&quot; </p>

<p>A source also confirmed that the Navy Yard is in the midst of a 20-year reduced rent agreement with Cumberland, although exact amounts were not disclosed. The planned outsourcing of industrial labor does not impact the rent agreement. </p>

<p>United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 2013, the union that represents the factory workers, was as surprised as its members by Friday&apos;s announcement. Union leadership has been in bargaining with Cumberland since September 30th, and says that the company gave no warning of the impending layoffs. </p>

<p>UFCW 2013 President Mark Carotenuto says that he hadn&apos;t yet breached economic issues in the bargaining process. According to the union, three quarters of the staff makes less than $15 per hour. </p>

<p>&quot;Never once did they bring up anything around competitve pressure,&quot; said Carotenuto by phone on Tuesday. Carotenuto said that Cumberland canceled its last two negotiating meetings with the union, scheduled for late December and Thursday January 7th. &quot;It was disturbing that before we talked dollars and cents they decided they couldn&apos;t compete,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023041553/http://cpack.com/press-release">press release put out last Friday</a> states that Cumberland turned down &quot;many lucrative offers&quot; to move or sell the business to a conglomerate over the years, but decided that the time is right in 2016 because, in the company&apos;s estimation, a sufficient number of food and manufacturing jobs &quot;have returned to Brooklyn and New York.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio announced a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023041553/http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/780-15/mayor-de-blasio-speaker-mark-viverito-action-plan-grow-21st-century-industrial-and#/0">ten-point, $115 million plan</a> to increase the number of industrial and manufacturing jobs in NYC last November.</p>

<p>At the time, NYC had 530,000 existing manufacturing and industrial jobs, making up 15.4% of the city&apos;s private sector work force. A recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023041553/https://nycfuture.org/data/info/manufacturing-in-nyc-a-snapshot">study</a> from the Center for an Urban Future found that the city gained 880 manufacturing jobs between 2011 and 2014, an increase of 1.2%. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023041553/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2016/01/8587418/sweet%E2%80%99n-low-workers-lash-out-soon-be-former-employer">Politico points out</a> that food manufacturing jobs saw the biggest increase, at 13.6%. However, food manufacturing has the lowest annual wages in manufacturing citywide&#x2014;only $32,882. </p>

<p>Cumberland has also pledged to work with the City and the Navy Yard to insure that each of its employees finds a new job, and both parties today confirmed these efforts. </p>

<p>&quot;Today, even as we complete the inevitable, we want to work with the union to help everyone who wants a job, find a job,&quot; said Eisenstadt in a statement. </p>

<p>Until the union sits down with company representatives on Wednesday, Carotenuto said that &quot;to me, it&apos;s a lot of smoke and mirrors.&quot; </p>

<p>Ranger, the machine operator from Bed-Stuy, says that he might start looking for a new job before notice comes from Cumberland. As for his industry of choice, &quot;I don&apos;t have experience in clerical work. Data processessing, word processing, I don&apos;t know anything about that,&quot; he said. &quot;I know how to drive a truck, or drive a fork lift, and I have warehouse experience.&quot; </p>

<p>He added that work skills aren&apos;t the only barrier to future employment. &quot;I&apos;m bilingual so that&apos;s a plus for me, but a lot of my coworkers don&apos;t speak English, which is why many of them are hurting,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of people here are in their 50s and 60s. Where is a person who is 50 or 60 going to do? Is an employer waiting to employ you if you can&apos;t speak the language?&quot; </p>

<p>Workers are rallying this afternoon outside of Cumberland Packing Company at 2 Cumberland Street. </p>
