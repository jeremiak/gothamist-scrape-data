<p>These days, New York State&apos;s Illegal Hotels law is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125041/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/30/sure_drag_tim_burton_into_this.php">most often cited</a> in conjunction with Airbnb. According to the 2010 law, New Yorkers cannot rent out entire apartments for under 30 days if the tenant on the lease is not present. High-turnover pseudo-hotels operating out of private residences not only erode the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125041/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/13/affordable_housing_trickle.php">dwindling housing stock</a>, they&apos;re also illegal. </p>

<p>But a group of City Councilmembers is pushing for an amendment to the law, which they say has had a negative consequence: Because hostels were never officially defined in the city&apos;s list of building classifications, they are subject to the same laws as apartments, and cannot be rented out to travelers on short-term visits. In other words, youth hostels are illegal in NYC. </p>

<p>According to the proposed legislation, hostels would get official recognition under the city building code. The city would also open a special office to regulate them, and permit hostels only in commercial neighborhoods. </p>

<p>&quot;This legislation is about leveling the playing field when it comes to providing inexpensive accommodations for travelers&#x2014;especially for young travelers from foreign countries,&quot; said Councilmember Margaret Chin in a statement. According to Chin&apos;s office, the legislation eliminated more than 50 youth hostels when it went into effect five years ago, and has cost the city millions in potential revenue. </p>

<p>A handful of &quot;hostels&quot; currently operate in NYC, but are technically registered as hotels in city records and offer &quot;hostel-like&quot; amenities, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125041/http://www.amny.com/news/hostels-in-nyc-made-illegal-in-2010-could-rebound-under-new-legislative-push-1.11174351">AM New York</a>. (Unlike hotels, hostels rent by the bed, rather than the room.) The only true hostel in NYC is the nonprofit organization <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125041/http://hinewyork.org/">Hostelling International</a> on the Upper West Side, which operates under a special permit awarded in 1989. Nightly rates start from $49, according to the hostel&apos;s website. The city&apos;s official tourism site estimates that the average daily room rate for a traditional hotel in 2014 was $297. </p>

<p>Chin added that youth hostels could serve as effective competition for Airbnb. </p>

<p>&quot;Current law eliminates the competition for Airbnb, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025125041/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/17/de_blasio_airbnb.php">taking thousands of units</a> of affordable housing off the rental market,&quot; she said. &quot;Without alternative, reasonably-priced accommodations, youth travelers will either continue to sidestep the Big Apple, or worse yet, hunt for illegal apartment rentals through Airbnb, accelerating our affordability crisis.&#x200E;&quot;</p>
