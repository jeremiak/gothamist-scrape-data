<p>A barefoot man wielding a machete allegedly chased two livery cab drivers down a Queens street early Sunday morning, after robbing one of them of $50 and a laptop. The suspect ended up cutting his own hand with the blade, and was hospitalized following his arrest. </p>

<p>Cab driver Santos Carraco picked up the suspect, 25-year-old Cloyd Clark, just before 8:00 a.m. on Sunday in Ozone Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325042355/http://nypost.com/2015/11/29/man-robs-cabbie-pulls-machete-on-drivers-friends-cops-say/">According to the Post</a>, Clark initially refused to get out of the front seat of the cab. As Carraco asked him repeatedly to leave, he grabbed $50 in cash and Carraco&apos;s laptop, and bolted from the car. </p>

A small group of livery drivers, including Carraco, drove to Woodhaven to meet the cab. <p></p>

<p>Confronted by Carraco, Clark initially agreed to return the stolen possessions, which he claimed were inside his home. Witnesses say he then went inside, and emerged with a machete. </p>

<p>&quot;It was crazy to wake up to that,&quot; one witness told the Post. &quot;The guy was running in his barefeet with a machete. He was just a crazy man. He was saying he was defending himself, but everyone was running from him.&quot;</p>

<p>Video of the arrest acquired by the Post shows Clark insisting, &quot;I&apos;m trying to protect myself, I&apos;m the one that&apos;s blooded up... All I&apos;m trying to do is scare him off, that&apos;s it.&quot; </p>

<p>Cops reportedly tackled Clark, who cut his own hand with the machete. The suspect was taken to Jamaica Hospital for treatment, and charges are pending. </p>
