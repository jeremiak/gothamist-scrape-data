					<p>Several hundred NYC high school and college students walked out of class at noon on Tuesday and gathered in Manhattan&apos;s Foley Square to protest President Donald Trump and his administration&apos;s policy proposals on public and higher education as well as, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214654/https://www.facebook.com/events/1598079813540420/">more broadly</a>, &quot;bigotry, hatred, and prejudice.&quot; </p>

<p>The walkout coincided with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214654/http://dcist.com/2017/02/betsy_devos.php">Senate confirmation of Betsy DeVos</a>, who became the first cabinet nominee in American history to be confirmed following a tie vote. Vice President Mike Pence broke the tie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214654/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/07/betsy-devos-senate-vote/">according to CBS</a>. DeVos has been derided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214654/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-charter-school-group-condemns-betsey-devos-essay-article-1.2956742?utm_source=Master+Mailing+List&amp;utm_campaign=bb689ed3e5-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_01_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_23e3b96952-bb689ed3e5-75477365">charter school</a> and public school advocates alike, for her apparent lack of basic education policy knowledge and numerous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214654/http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/317975-the-ethics-case-against-betsy-devos">conflicts of interest</a>.   </p>

<p>&quot;Betsy DeVos was confirmed today despite her shameful inexperience and complete lack of understanding for the very job she seeks,&quot; one student speaker shouted into the mic, to loud boos from the crowd.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the rain, students also mic-checked their support for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214654/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/22/columbia_says_campus_will_be_sanctu.php">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)</a>, an Obama administration legacy that defers deportation for the children of undocumented immigrants. </p>

<p>&quot;Even though there was a temporary halt on the Muslim ban,&quot; organizers wrote in a Facebook event for the group, &quot;we must remain vigilant. Focus on the next issue. Focus on the injustice that went unnoticed.&quot; </p>

<p>Chants included &quot;Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!&quot; and &quot;Education, not deportation!&quot; and &quot;No registry! Fuck white supremacy! No ban!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This is a learning space. This is a classroom. This is a lesson in civic history,&quot; said Public Advocate Letitia James, addressing the crowd. &quot;Throughout history it&apos;s always been young people who have stood in the face of intolerance and indifference to demand tolerance and demand love.&quot; </p>

<p>You can watch the rally and march live here, both of which were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214654/http://www.amny.com/news/politics/nyc-students-protest-trump-s-ban-on-refugees-immigrants-1.13074563">reportedly organized by</a> 17-year-old organizer Hebh Jamal with the New York Immigration Coalition, Arab American Association of New York, and MPower Change: </p>

<p>The march from Foley Square is set to end at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) building at 26 Federal Plaza. </p>
