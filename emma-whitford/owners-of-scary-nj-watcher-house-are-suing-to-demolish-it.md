<p>More than two years after Derek and Maria Broaddus spent $1.3 million on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/the_watcher_history.php">allegedly-haunted &apos;Watcher&apos; house</a> on a tony block in Westfield, New Jersey, the couple is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://nypost.com/2017/03/27/watcher-house-owners-sue-to-demolish-home-over-stalker-letters/">back in court</a> trying to rid themselves of the investment they&apos;re too afraid to inhabit. The Broaddus family is still suing for the full purchase price of 657 Boulevard and punitive damages, and has now filed a second suit, in the hopes of demolishing the spooky home and building two new houses on the lot&#x2014;a plan that&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2016/09/watcher_house_owners_want_to_tear_down_infamous_ho.html">kicking around since September</a>. </p>

<p>The Broadduses bought the innocuous-seeming home in July 2014, and said cryptic notes from an anonymous stalker started arriving in their mailbox three days after they took up residence with their three young children. &quot;Do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested?&quot; one note asked. &quot;Have you found all the secrets it holds. Will the young bloods play in the basement. Who has the bedrooms facing the street? I will know as soon as you move in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have they found out what&apos;s in the walls yet?&quot; he/she added. &quot;I am pleased to know your names now, and the name of the young blood you have brought to me.&quot; </p>

<p>Threats from the so-called &quot;Watcher&quot; quickly drove the frightened family from the premises. Gothamist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/31/the_watcher.php">spent a day exploring the neighborhood in July 2015</a>, after a former resident contacted reporter Lauren Evans with a tip: &quot;The Watcher is a local crazy who lives on the street and harasses everyone. Apparently he&apos;s an adult son of a couple living on the street.&quot; Evans&apos;s conclusion, after a day of pavement pounding, was more or less this: &quot;Most people aren&apos;t comfortable talking about it.&quot; </p>

<p>Plans to demolish the house, which would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2016/09/watcher_house_owners_want_to_tear_down_infamous_ho.html">reportedly require a zoning variance</a>, were unanimously rejected by a town planning board in January, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2017/01/notorious_watcher_house_must_stay_will_be_demolish.html">according to NJ.com</a>. While the Broadduses insist they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2016/09/watcher_house_owners_want_to_tear_down_infamous_ho.html">cannot live in a house</a> that receives threatening letters from an anonymous stalker, their neighbors seem primarily concerned with how the demolition might harm the overall character of the neighborhood. &quot;We should be particularly vigilant in protecting this beautiful block,&quot; one board member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2017/01/notorious_watcher_house_must_stay_will_be_demolish.html">testified</a> earlier this year. </p>

<p>James Foerst, an attorney representing the Broadduses, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002539/http://nypost.com/2017/03/27/watcher-house-owners-sue-to-demolish-home-over-stalker-letters/">told the NY Post</a> that &quot;My clients are good people. They&apos;re caught in a situation they didn&apos;t ask for.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the damages suit, prior owners John and Andrea Woods filed a countersuit, also pending, arguing that all of the media attention on their old home had a negative impact. </p>
