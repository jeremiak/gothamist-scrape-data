<p>A Times Square Cookie Monster was stabbed in the back early Saturday night after he reportedly tried to break up a fight between a man dressed as a Native American and another man dressed as a pilot. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710154155/http://nypost.com/2016/10/30/it-was-not-a-good-halloween-for-times-square-characters/">According to the Post</a>, the man in the pilot costume attacked the man in the Native American costume because he thought the garb was racist.</p>

<p>The costumed character fight broke out at 5:45 p.m. on Saturday on West 50th Street near the corner of Broadway, according to the NYPD. The Post reports that the 30-year-old &quot;pilot,&quot; dressed specifically as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710154155/http://tuskegeeairmen.org/">Tuskegee Airman</a>, was arguing with the &quot;American Indian&quot; about his costume when Cookie Monster stepped in. The  pilot then allegedly pulled a knife out of his boot and stabbed Cookie Monster in the back. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the NYPD said that Cookie Monster checked himself into the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital, and that his injuries weren&apos;t life threatening. (She couldn&apos;t confirm the Post&apos;s report that Cookie Monster suffered a lacerated spleen.) No arrests have been made, and an investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>Though your Halloweekend hangover is telling you otherwise, today is the actual holiday. Avoid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170710154155/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/29/racist_halloween_costumes.php">racist costumes</a> and stabby pilots. </p>
