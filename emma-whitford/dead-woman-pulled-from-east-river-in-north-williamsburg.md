<p>An unidentified woman in her 40s was extracted from the East River in North Williamsburg on Wednesday morning, and pronounced dead on the scene. The recovery mission temporarily interrupted East River Ferry service at the North 6th Street dock during rush hour. </p>

<p>The FDNY responded to the scene shortly after 7:45 a.m. and extracted the victim, according to a spokesman for the department. The NYPD confirmed that the victim was discovered in the river, face down and unconscious without any clothing. It was not immediately clear where the victim entered the river, or if she fell or jumped. The cause of death is pending confirmation from the Medical Examiner&apos;s office, although the NYPD confirmed that the woman had no apparent trauma to her body. </p>

<p>Local resident Michael Cinquino noticed commotion on the North Williamsburg pier from his apartment nearby, and went outside to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708091038/https://www.periscope.tv/w/1RDGlBLaLZoxL">film the operation</a>. &quot;I saw a bunch of rescue vehicles and people running,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I saw them pull a body out of the East River and pull it up onto the pier. They roped off the pier as well.&quot;</p>

<p>Cinquino estimated that ferry service was up and running about 45 minutes after the body was extracted, just before 9:00 a.m. &quot;Passengers didn&apos;t realize that they were walking past a dead body in a body bag,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Another neighbor, David Woodley, said that cops were still on the ferry dock at 10:45 a.m. </p>

<p>The East River Ferry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
