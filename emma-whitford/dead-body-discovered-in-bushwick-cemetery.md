<p>A caretaker who mows the grass at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103957/http://interment.net/data/us/ny/kings/mostholy/index.htm">Most Holy Trinity Cemetery</a> in Bushwick was making rounds around 9:15 this morning when he came across a dead body, according to the NYPD. The department confirmed that the victim, a man who appears to have been in his 30s, was beginning to decompose. He had likely been in the park &quot;for a day or two,&quot; according to a spokesman. </p>

<p>The 23-acre cemetery, with an entrance at 685 Central Avenue near the Wilson Avenue L stop, was established in 1851 by the local German Catholic community. It&apos;s characterized by wooden crosses and &quot;rusted metal markers,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103957/https://nycemetery.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/most-holy-trinity-cemetery/">according to the New York Cemetery Project</a>.  </p>

<p>Cops have yet to ID the victim, and the Medical Examiner&apos;s cause of death report is pending. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103957/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/unidentified-person-found-dead-brooklyn-cemetery-article-1.2684943">The NY Post reports</a> that the NYPD is trying to determine if the body&#x2014;which didn&apos;t show signs of trauma&#x2014;was dumped inside the cemetery. <br>
