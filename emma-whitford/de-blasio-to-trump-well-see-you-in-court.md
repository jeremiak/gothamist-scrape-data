<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio convened an emergency press conference on Wednesday night to address President Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/trump_sanctuary_cities.php">executive order</a> threatening to strip federal funding from &quot;sanctuary cities,&quot; i.e. cities where local law enforcement and city agencies generally don&apos;t cooperate with federal immigration authorities. He emphasized that the order is &quot;vague&quot; in its language, and that New York City is prepared to challenge it in court. </p>

<p>&quot;We are immediately struck by how vague it is, and how subject to challenge it is,&quot; de Blasio told reporters. </p>

<p>&quot;The stroke of a pen in Washington does not change the people of NYC or its values,&quot; he added, insisting that, &quot;We&apos;re not going to allow our police officers to be used as immigration enforcement agents. It&apos;s as simple as that.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/824347165208248320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">executive order</a>, which President Trump signed this afternoon, states the following: </p>

<blockquote>[T]he Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary. </blockquote> 

<p>Zachary Carter, legal counsel to the mayor, pointed to the phrase &quot;to the extent consistent with the law.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There are hedges embedded right in the order itself,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>&quot;We believe we are on solid ground for a legal challenge,&quot; de Blasio added. He referenced the 2012 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/567/11-393/opinion3.html">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a>, which found that the federal government could not withhold unrelated funding from states unwilling to comply with a federal mandate. </p>

<p>But even as he insisted that the executive order has weak legs, de Blasio offered his understanding of where funding could be cut, based on his office&apos;s perusing the order. If President Trump were able to withhold federal funding from New York City, he predicted, it would hit the NYPD the hardest. </p>

<p>NYPD Commissioner Jimmy O&apos;Neill echoed the concern, estimating somewhere between $150 and $160 million in federal cuts to anti-terrorism efforts, including bomb squad training, security cameras and overtime, as well as security for the United Nations, and, ironically, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/here_have_more_nightmares.php">Trump Tower</a>. </p>

<p>Even this was hedged, though, as de Blasio acknowledged language in the order indicating that federal grants could be withheld with the <em>exception</em> of law enforcement funding. &quot;This order is written in a very vague fashion,&quot; he reiterated. </p>

<p>The city&apos;s next fiscal year budget, a preliminary version of which was presented this week, calls for $7 billion in federal funding. Budget experts say most of that money goes towards programs that serve low-income families. </p>

<p>&quot;Federal funding goes predominantly toward social services, education and health,&quot; Maria Doulis, director of city studies for the Citizens Budget Commission, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/nyc_budget_2017_trump.php">told Gothamist this week</a>. &quot;To the extent that the federal government pulls back on these things, it will put pressure on the state and the city. And there is a limit to how much the city can do to address these needs on its own.&quot;</p>

<p>Other elected officials took the podium on Wednesday, stating their intention to defy Trump&apos;s efforts to deport. There are an estimated 500,000 undocumented immigrants in New York City. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170126/civic-center/trump-immigration-crime-de-blasio-excutive-order">as DNAInfo points out</a>, the order refers to &apos;aliens,&apos; a category that includes legal immigrants and those with green card status, or asylum. </p>

<p>&quot;If there was ever any doubt in anyone&apos;s mind whether Donald Trump&apos;s hateful, bigoted rhetoric truly reflected his intentions, today&apos;s executive orders confirm that his agenda will take our country down a dangerous and divisive path,&quot; said City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. </p>

<p>&quot;Although there are many unknowns, one thing is certain,&quot; she added. &quot;The City Council&apos;s commitment to protect our city is unwavering.&quot; </p>

<p>Democratic Congressman Joe Crowley (eastern Bronx and north-central Queens) alluded to New York&apos;s role as a major contributor to federal coffers.</p>

<p>&quot;We give more to the feds than we get back,&quot; Crowley said. &quot;And you know what? New Yorkers are getting tired more and more that we are a donor state, and we have other states electing people like Donald Trump who then come in and dictate to us that we&apos;re going to get less than we deserve to keep our people safe.&quot; </p>

<p>Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, whose office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/anticipating-major-changes-federal-immigration-enforcement-ag-schneiderman-provides">issued legal guidance</a> last week for sanctuary jurisdictions, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/https://twitter.com/AGSchneiderman/status/824362523529007104/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">accused President Trump of making empty threats</a> this afternoon.</p>

<p>The NYPD is not, it&apos;s important to note, severed from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. &apos;Sanctuary city&apos; status <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/15/trump_immigration_promises.php">only curtails</a> ICE intervention. Early in Wednesday&apos;s press conference de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/https://twitter.com/courtneycgross/status/824381815913844736">held up a list</a> of 170 offenses that the NYPD has cooperated with homeland security on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/520-14/mayor-bill-de-blasio-signs-law-bills-dramatically-reduce-new-york-city-s-cooperation-with#/0">since 2014</a>. These wide-ranging offenses, broadly categorized as &quot;public safety concerns,&quot; include criminal sale of a controlled substance, burglary, trespass, rape, murder, and vehicular manslaughter, among others. De Blasio referred to the list as &quot;a middle ground that works.&quot; </p>

<p>Immigrants with green cards and permanent resident status are also subject to deportation if for committing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://gothamist.com/tags/brokenwindows">broken windows offenses</a> like turnstile jumping. </p>

<p>When a reporter asked the mayor if he would scale back on broken windows policing in the face of an emboldened ICE, he deferred. </p>

<p>&quot;Look, let&#x2019;s take one thing at a time here,&quot; de Blasio sad. </p>

<p>Also today, Trump signed an executive order for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/donald-trump-build-wall-immigration-executive-orders/index.html">construction of a wall</a> along the United States border with Mexico. He&#x2019;s expected to issue another barring refugees from Middle Eastern countries&#x2014;a move that thousands of New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128172951/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/immigrant_muslim_rally.php">are currently protesting</a>, among other things.</p>

<p><strong>[Update 1/27]:</strong> This piece has been updated with the mayor&apos;s response to a question about broken windows policing. </p>
