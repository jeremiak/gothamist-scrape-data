<p>A 54-year-old woman was shot in the knee by a stray bullet while crossing the street near Lincoln Terrace Park in Crown Heights on Monday evening. She is currently hospitalized in stable condition. </p>

<p>&#x201C;I was walking to the store, ready to go inside,&#x201D; Maribel Pagan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053818/http://nypost.com/2016/01/26/bystander-struck-by-stray-bullet-while-walking-to-store/">told the Post</a> earlier this week from her hospital bed at Kings County Hospital. &#x201C;I felt something hit me in my leg. He shot me!&#x201D;</p>

<p>The NYPD confirmed that Pagan was shot in the left knee while crossing Carroll Street at Utica Avenue at approximately 9 p.m. on Monday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053818/http://abc7ny.com/news/caught-on-camera-woman-struck-by-stray-bullet-in-brooklyn/1176742/">ABC7 acquired</a> security camera footage of the incident, which shows the victim stepping into the crosswalk and falling suddenly into the still-high snowbank. Several pedestrians run to her aid. The news outlet identified Pagan as a disabled mother of three children. </p>

<p>It was not immediately clear who the shooter&apos;s intended target may have been, although Pagan told the Post that she saw one man chasing another on the opposite side of the street just before the bullet hit her. &quot;There were people in the street walking,&quot; she added. &quot;How are you going to do that? Do you not have any brains? I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made as of Thursday morning. </p>
