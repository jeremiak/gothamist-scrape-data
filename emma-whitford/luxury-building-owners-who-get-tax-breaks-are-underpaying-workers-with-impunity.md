<p>City agencies are consistently failing to enforce a prevailing wage requirement for nonunion doormen, janitors, concierges and supervisors at certain luxury apartment buildings, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/https://www.propublica.org/article/nyc-lets-luxury-building-owners-stiff-workers-and-still-get-a-tax-break?utm_campaign=sprout&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=1451492374">new investigation by ProPublica</a>. Unchecked by the Comptroller&apos;s office, many of these building owners continue to collect large tax breaks, despite the fact that they pay their workers as little as $10 per hour. </p>

<p>The city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://gothamist.com/tags/421a">421-a tax abatement program</a>, which incentivizes private developers to build residential housing in exchange for $1.1 billion in annual tax abatements, has been established for more than four decades, and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/26/nyc_rent_cuomo_albany_fubar.php">renewed this June</a> despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/17/gentrification_protest_brooklyn.php">considerable</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/17/gentrification_protest_brooklyn.php">opposition</a> from housing advocates. </p>

<p>Prevailing wage requirements were tacked on comparatively recently, in 2007. According to the new requirements, any 421-a-eligible apartment built after December 2007 with more than 50 units is required to pay its employees a prevailing wage in order to receive any tax abatements from the state. </p>

<p>About 400 buildings have come under the 421-a wage requirement since 2007, according to a city estimate. </p>

<p>Politicians who sponsored the prevailing wage legislation told ProPublica that &quot;up to half&quot; of the large apartment buildings receiving tax breaks fail to meet this requirement. For comparison, about 80% of workers at all NYC buildings earn a prevailing wage, which is set by the Comptroller and is intended to keep pace with union-negotiated wages. </p>

<p>ProPublica spoke to Isaac Bowman of East New York, who works as a concierge at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://www.forestproperties.net/property/exo/">The Exo</a>, at 117-unit luxury apartment in Astoria that boasts &quot;a 24-hour concierge service to fit your hectic schedule.&quot; In June, Bowman was making just $10.50 an hour to mop floors, vacuum and clean bathrooms on top of traditional concierge duties. </p>

<p>In today&apos;s dollars, concierges are required to earn $16.88 per hour, plus benefits valuing about $10 per hour. </p>

<p>While the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) administers 421-a, it bequeathed enforcement of the abatement&apos;s parameters to the Comptroller&apos;s office last summer. Still, it&apos;s up to the workers themselves to bring wage-theft allegations. And much like tenants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/wait_landlords_did_what_now.php">unwittingly paying</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://gothamist.com/tags/ProPublica/2">bloated, illegal rents</a> in regulated units, many workers in luxury apartment buildings have no idea that they are owed significantly more than their take-home wages. </p>

<p>While some buildings brazenly ignore the law, others try to skirt it by taking advantage of loopholes. </p>

<p>At The Exo, Bowman was told to join a specific union if he wanted to keep his job&#x2014;one that required a wage lower than that set by the comptroller. And at 64-unit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://www.thedriggs.com/index1.html">220 North 10th Street</a> in Williamsburg, the self-described &quot;pinnacle of Williamsburg luxury,&quot; one doorman earned a lower wage during the night shift, when his employer classified him as an &quot;unarmed guard.&quot; </p>

<p>To combat wage theft, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://www.seiu32bj.org/">SEIU 32BJ</a>, the country&apos;s largest service-workers&apos; union, has launched a campaign to inform and empower building workers about illegal wages. 32BJ President Hector Figueroa described his role to ProPublica as &quot;neighborhood police.&quot; </p>

<p>Recently, the union has stepped in to help doormen and building managers at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513151407/http://341epw.com/">341 Eastern Parkway</a>, a new luxury development looming over the Franklin Avenue 2/3/4/5 subway stop that earns an annual $451,000 tax break. There, building super Francis Alphonse earns $15.63 per hour with no benefits. According to the prevailing wage law, he should be making $24.83 per hour plus benefits. </p>

<p>Alphonse and his coworkers didn&apos;t learn that they were being stiffed until they made moves to unionize in recent months, and got in touch with 32BJ. </p>

<p>32BJ President Figueroa told us in a statement that 32BJ is currently working with &quot;dozens&quot; of 421-a apartment buildings in NYC that &quot;aren&#x2019;t paying workers the prevailing wage they are obligated to pay as a condition of getting the tax break.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We will continue to support the workers at 421-a buildings that aren&#x2019;t paying the prevailing wage to ensure the regulations are enforced and the workers get the fair pay they deserve,&quot; he added.</p>
