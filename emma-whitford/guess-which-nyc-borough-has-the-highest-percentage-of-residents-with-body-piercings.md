										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="053116_Piercings.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016141953im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/053116_Piercings.jpeg" width="640" height="412"> <br> <i> (Getty)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Apparently unsatisfied with the superlatives for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016141953/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/17/operation_mass_vasectomy.php">New York City Borough With The Most Deer</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016141953/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/10/video_heres_what_the_dazzling_view.php">New York City Borough With The Largest Future Amusement Park Ride</a>, Staten Island has snatched the title of New York City Borough With The Most Body Piercings, according to a recent Department of Health community survey. </p>

<p>The DOH&apos;s 2014 study asked New Yorkers to self-report piercings through any body part aside from the earlobe&#x2014;tongue, nose, lip, cheek, etc. etc.&#x2014;and found that 18% of responding Staten Islanders had body jewelry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016141953/http://nypost.com/2016/05/30/staten-islanders-lead-nyc-in-body-piercings-study/">according to the Post</a> (for comparison, Queens was the least-pierced, with 11% of respondents confirming their body art). </p>

<p>City-wide, the DOH found that 14% of New Yorkers have body jewelry, the vast majority of them women. </p>

<p>Why does the city care about impulse decisions that might or might not originate on St. Mark&apos;s Place? A spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday that the DOH might instate new regulations at piercing parlors to cut down the risk of Hepatitis C and HIV transmission. Before you go running after alternatives, keep in mind that these fake tongue rings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016141953/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/13/teenagers_and_other_idiots_magnetic.php">are deadly</a>.</p>
