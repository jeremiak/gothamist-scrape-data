<p>Sources within City Hall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/nyregion/de-blasios-press-secretary-karen-hinton-says-she-will-quit.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a> that Hinton&apos;s decision to resign was not related to the recent spate of controversy surrounding her soon-to-be-former boss. Hinton reportedly sent her letter of resignation on April 6th&#x2014;after the Mayor&apos;s office came under fire for its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/deblasio_45_rivington_preet.php">possible involvement</a> in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/45_rivington_press_conference.php">$116 million deal to turn a nursing home into luxury apartments</a>, but before U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced that he would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/09/de_blasio_fund-raising_corruption.php">investigate the Mayor&apos;s campaign fundraising</a>. </p>

<p>Hinton, 57, told the paper that she was leaving her post, in part, to spend more time with her teenage daughter. She reportedly plans to return to her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/38007-Karen-Hinton-Lauded-by-Ecuadorian-Communities-for-Work-Holding-Chevron-Accountable-for-Toxic-Dumping">old line of work</a>, serving as a spokeswoman for Ecuadorians pushing back against Chevron&apos;s contamination of the Amazon River. </p>

<p>&quot;The mayor&apos;s commitment and tenacity have turned progressive values into everyday realities for so many New York City families,&quot; she said in a statement Thursday. &quot;I am proud to have been part of that effort and look forward to continuing to support the mayor&apos;s future successes.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio has become the subject of a handful of investigations since early April, led by Bharara in conjunction with the FBI, as well as Comptroller Scott Stringer&apos;s office and the State Attorney General&apos;s office. In addition to the controversy surrounding the $116 million nursing home flip, he&apos;s been questioned for his support of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/22/nyclass_subpoenaed.php">banning horse carriages</a>, and his relationship to a duo of top donors who have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/nypd_corruption_fbi.php">accused of bribing</a> top NYPD officials.</p>

<p>Last week, following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/24/de_blasio_investigation_continues.php">allegations from the state Board of Elections</a> that de Blasio violated campaign finance law by shuttling large donations to three upstate Democrats through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.elections.ny.gov/CFCommittees.html">county political committees</a>, the Wall Street Journal reported that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/27/subpoenas_fly_at_city_hall.php">two of the Mayor&apos;s top aids</a> and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://gothamist.com/tags/berlinrosen">PR firm of choice</a> had been issued subpoenas.   </p>

<p>De Blasio has said repeatedly that he will cooperate with all investigations, and that &quot;everything we&apos;ve done from the beginning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/04/8597882/de-blasio-confronted-reporters-says-hes-confident-he-followed-law">is legal and appropriate</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>Married to Howard Glaser, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140421/REAL_ESTATE/140419843/top-cuomo-aide-howard-glaser-to-resign">former aide to Governor Cuomo</a>, Hinton was hired at a time when the Mayor&apos;s public feud with the Governor was just ramping up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/05/8598437/de-blasio-press-secretary-leave-administration">apparently</a> to help the Mayor take a stronger stand in the ongoing public spar-fest (Politico NY described her &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/07/8572180/cost-and-benefit-karen-hinton">putative Helen of Troy role</a>&quot; last July). Early on in her stint, during the Legionnaires&#x2019; disease outbreak in New York, Hinton accused New York State health commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker of disrespecting NYC health commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett during a press conference. A senior de Blasio aide publicly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/nyregion/legionnaires-disease-outbreak-is-waning-new-york-health-official-says.html">accused Hinton of going too far</a>.  </p>

<p>Earlier this week, the Mayor announced that he had hired a new speech writer and a new social media director. He has yet to announce a replacement for Hinton. </p>

<p>&quot;Karen Hinton has served our Administration with skill, with devotion, with a passionate commitment to others, and she will be missed,&quot; de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917150431/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/05/8598437/de-blasio-press-secretary-leave-administration">said in a statement</a>. </p>
