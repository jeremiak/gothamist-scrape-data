<p>A 24-year-old Jewish man was punched in the face on Wednesday night inside a campus building at Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights. When the victim, a student at the college, asked his attacker for an explanation he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033751/http://jpupdates.com/2015/12/23/jewish-student-assaulted-in-apparent-hate-crime-inside-brooklyn-college/">reportedly responded</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t like white and Jewish Boys. Leave the school you Jew.&quot; </p>

<p>The assault took place around 6 p.m. on Wednesday inside 1638 Bedford Avenue on the Medgar Evers campus, according to the NYPD. The suspect, identified only as a black male, allegedly bumped into the victim while he stood in the hallway with a group of acquaintances. </p>

<p>According to school officials, the victim was wearing a yarmulke and had just finished taking a science exam. The suspect proceeded to punch him and make anti-Semitic remarks before leaving the building through the main entrance. </p>

<p>One of the student witnesses, a Muslim woman, helped notify school security. The victim later told officials that he did not know his assailant and believed that he was targeted because of his religion, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427033751/http://jpupdates.com/2015/12/23/jewish-student-assaulted-in-apparent-hate-crime-inside-brooklyn-college/">according to JP Updates</a>. He did not require medical attention. </p>

<p>&quot;The fact that a Muslim woman came to the defense of an orthodox Jewish man is a true reflection of the values that permeate this great institution,&quot; said school president Rudolph Crew in a statement. &quot;While such incidents are fortunately rare on campus, even one is too many. To attack someone because of his or her race or religious beliefs is appalling.&quot; </p>

<p>School officials have yet to determine if the suspect is affiliated with Medgar Evers, and NYPD officials confirmed that an investigation into the attack is ongoing. </p>
