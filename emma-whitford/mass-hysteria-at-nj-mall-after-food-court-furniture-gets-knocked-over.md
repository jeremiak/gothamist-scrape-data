<p>Shoppers panicked and rushed out of a New Jersey mall on Monday evening after a chair and some tables slammed to the ground in the food court, according to Elizabeth, New Jersey Mayor Chris Bollwage and local police. Nearby mall patrons thought the slamming was a gunshot and said as much, prompting the hysteria. </p>

<p>&quot;That was enough mass hysteria for me,&quot; one witness wrote on Instagram, apparently a tourist. &quot;I don&apos;t even want to go to the ball drop New Year&apos;s Eve, whatever this was that took place was enough to not want to do anything the rest of the trip.&quot; </p>

<p>The incident took place at The Mills in Jersey Gardens, a two-floor outlet mall on Kapkowski Road in Elizabeth. Videos on social media posted around 5:00 p.m. show shoppers running through the mall and parking lot, as well as armed police officers patrolling. In at least one instance, shoppers took cover inside of a shop. </p>

<p>Elizabeth Police Lieutenant Michael Kelly told Gothamist that officers responded to the mall at 4:57 p.m. on Monday. &quot;Basically it was a fight in the food court and some tables got knocked over and people heard the loud noise and took it as gun fire and got nervous,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;In reality it was just a fight where the tables got knocked over and made loud noises.&quot; </p>

<p>Kelly said that there were no arrests, and that nine people sustained minor injuries during the ensuing rushed evacuation. </p>

<p>&quot;The safety and security of our guests and employees is our top priority,&quot; the mall said in a statement to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229172044/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2016/12/heavy_police_presence_at_jersey_gardens_in_elizabe.html#incart_river_home">New Jersey Advance</a>. &quot;As this is an ongoing investigation, we ask that you direct all further questions to the Elizabeth Police Department.&quot;</p>

False reports of gunshots in the Roosevelt Field Mall foodcourt&#x2014;possibly chairs hitting the ground&#x2014;prompted a stampede. </p>

<p>Last week, a man walked into an evening showing of the movie La La Land and approached the screen, prompting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229172044/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/19/union_square_movie_stampede.php">frantic evacuation</a>. </p>
