<p>A 53-year-old woman was shot in the stomach outside of a Hampton Inn in Queens on Thursday night, while attempting to defend her daughter from a robber. According to the NYPD, the suspect pistol-whipped the 20-year-old woman in the head before her mother intervened. </p>

<p>The 53-year-old victim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503170239/http://m.nydailynews.com/woman-critically-injured-shooting-hotel-queens-article-1.2505455?utm_content=buffera6fea&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">identified by the News</a> as Andrea Koller of Maryland, remains in critical condition at Jamaica hospital. The NYPD confirmed that the victim and her daughter were visiting NYC from out of town. </p>

<p>Koller and her daughter arrived at the Hampton Inn at 144-10 135th Ave near JFK airport shortly before 8:30 p.m. on Thursday, according to the NYPD. Koller exited her vehicle to inquire about a room, leaving her daughter in the passenger seat. While Koller was inside, a man opened the driver-side door, demanded money, and hit the daughter in the head with his firearm. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503170239/http://nypost.com/2016/01/22/thugs-pistol-whip-woman-shoot-her-mom-near-jfk-airport/">The Post reports</a> that the man also stole her rings. </p>

<p>Police say Koller ran to her daughter&apos;s aid, and &quot;struggled&quot; with the man. The suspect then shot her once in the torso before fleeing the scene in a Volkswagen Jetta with her purse and cellphone. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman said that there may have been an accomplice in the getaway car. </p>

<p>The Hampton Inn declined to comment. </p>

<p>Surveillance footage acquired by the Post shows the suspect&apos;s Jetta following the victim&apos;s vehicle into the parking lot before the attack. </p>

<p>Both the Post and the News also note that Andrea Koller, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503170239/https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-koller-724874a6">English language teacher</a> in the Baltimore public school system, published a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503170239/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-01-09/news/ph-tt-letters-koller-0109-2-20130109_1_gun-violence-bushmaster-assault-rifle-legal-weapons">letter to the editor</a> in the Baltimore Sun in 2013, decrying gun violence.</p>

<p>&quot;We cannot cling to the na&#xEF;ve belief that we are safe merely because someone runs a background check on a gun buyer,&quot; Koller wrote. &quot;Guns change hands and the simple truth is, more guns in more hands means more gun-based crimes.&quot; </p>
