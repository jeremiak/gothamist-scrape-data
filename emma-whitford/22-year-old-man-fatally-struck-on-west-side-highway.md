<p>A 22-year-old man was fatally struck by a driver on the West Side Highway in Hell&apos;s Kitchen early Sunday morning, according to the NYPD. A preliminary investigation suggests that the 22-year-old climbed over a divider and stepped into oncoming traffic before he was killed. </p>

<p>Police responded to a call of a pedestrian struck at West 46th Street and 12th Avenue shortly after 2:15 this morning. Upon arrival officers discovered the young man, whose name has not been released, unconscious and unresponsive in the roadway. EMS transported him to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. </p>

<p>The driver, who also has not been identified, was headed north on 12th Avenue at the time of the crash. He or she remained on the scene, and no charges have been filed as of this afternoon. An investigation into the crash is ongoing. </p>
