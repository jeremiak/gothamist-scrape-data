					<p>Lead organizers of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630105857/http://dcist.com/2017/01/photos_womens_march_is_packed_and_t.php#photo-1">Women&apos;s March on Washington</a>, including activists Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, and Carmen Perez, were among a small group of protesters arrested in Columbus Circle during a &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630105857/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/07/national_womens_liberation.php">Day Without a Woman</a>&apos; action Wednesday, according to photos taken at the scene. </p>

<p>The arrests took place around 1:30 p.m. today, as about 400 people gathered in Columbus Circle and behind NYPD barricades on Central Park West. The NYPD could not immediately confirm how many people were arrested, or their charges. </p>

<p>Reporter Scott Heins estimates that the multigenerational crowd is roughly 75% women, with most protesters dressed in red for solidarity. Throughout the day today, strike organizers are urging women and their allies to refrain from paid and unpaid labor, if possible, and avoid spending money. </p>

<p>&quot;It think [striking from work] is a good way to show the impact of women at work,&quot; said 23-year-old Rosemary Cipriano, who works in advertising for Broadway shows. &quot;A lot of people take it for granted how many women are in their workplace, especially in media.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was lucky enough that our CEO was very supportive of all of the women leaving,&quot; she added. &quot;I took a personal day, and that&apos;s a privilege a lot of people don&apos;t have. I totally feel that and understand that, and that&apos;s why I&apos;m obligated to come and speak out and march and do what I can.&quot;  </p>

<p>Several NYPD vans are currently parked on Columbus Circle and police are preventing protesters from entering the street. There is also a bus, apparently for arrested protesters, on the scene. The sidewalk in front of the Trump International Hotel is completely closed to foot traffic. Shortly after the arrests, police used a speaker to announce that pedestrians are prohibited from blocking the sidewalk or walking in the street. </p>
