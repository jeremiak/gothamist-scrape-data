<p>Workers at a Duane Reade in Midtown told police that a man displayed a syringe while robbing their store on Saturday morning, stated that he had AIDS, and threatened to &quot;stick anyone who tried to stop him,&quot; according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>Police said the incident occurred around 10:10 a.m. Saturday at the Duane Reade at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025131313/http://fisherbrothers.com/properties/49-e-52nd-street">49 East 52nd Street</a>, between Madison Avenue and Park Avenue. The suspect, believed to be about 5&apos;4&quot; tall, allegedly made away with about $440 in skin lotion, shampoo, and conditioner. </p>

<p>A similar incident took place the next day, at the same Duane Reade, the NYPD said. A man entered the store around 1:25 p.m. and took 16 toothbrushes worth $144, 25 Pantene shampoo bottles worth $300, $206 worth of Aveeno lotions, and four tubes of toothpaste. </p>

<p>During both robberies the suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025131313/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160815/midtown/i-have-full-blown-aids-syringe-wielding-thief-tells-duane-reade-workers">allegedly told workers</a>, &quot;I have full-blown AIDS.&quot; </p>

<p>The NYPD could not immediately confirm if the same suspect was being sought for both incidents. An investigation is ongoing, and no arrests have been made as of Monday afternoon. </p>
