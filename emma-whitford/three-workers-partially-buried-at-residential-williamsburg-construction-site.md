<p>The fire department responded to 146 Wilson Street near the corner of Bedford Avenue at 9:16 a.m., according to a spokesman for the department. </p>

<p>The call was in regards to a &quot;partial collapse in the basement.&quot; Two individuals were rescued from the soil and transported to Woodhull Medical Center with minor injuries. A third victim was transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. The FDNY did not have any details on the injuries sustained. </p>

<p>There are no construction permits filed for the address on the Department of Buildings website. However, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402040419/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=4&amp;vlcompdetlkey=0001931495">complaint filed this morning</a> calls for an &quot;inspection due to excavation collapse.&quot; </p>

<p>The FDNY confirmed that both buildings adjacent to 146 Wilson have been evacuated as a precaution. A spokesman for the Department of Buildings said that the department is on the scene conducting a structural stability inspection. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4:45:</strong> The Department of Buildings issued a statement on Monday afternoon: </p>

<blockquote>This morning&#x2019;s cave-in is a stark reminder of the dangers of working without permits or proper safeguards. The Department is investigating this illegal construction project and we will do everything in our power to identify and hold accountable those responsible for endangering public safety.</blockquote>

<p>The DOB also confirmed that the collapse was caused by excavation in the basement of 146 Wilson, and that the cave-in compromised the stability of adjacent walls at 144 Wilson, a synagog, and 148 Wilson, a three-unit residential building. HPD has hired contractors to secure all three buildings, but a vacate order will remain in effect until work is complete. </p>
