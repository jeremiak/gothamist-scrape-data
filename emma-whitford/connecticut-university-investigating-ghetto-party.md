<p>Students at Fairfield University, a predominantly-white Catholic university in Fairfield, Connecticut, are under investigation by school administrators after allegedly hosting a &quot;ghetto-themed&quot; party at an off-campus beach house on Saturday. In the days since, Fairfield undergraduates have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061331/http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/fairfield_university_investigating_race-themed_off-campus_party/">described photos</a> they saw posted to social media&#x2014;students wearing baggy clothing and holding 40oz Coors Light. Others told us on Monday that they had seen pictures of students with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061331/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3460257/Fairfield-University-investigating-ghetto-themed-party-students-wore-blackface-makeup-gold-chains-drank-40oz-bottles-beer.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490">fake teardrop</a> and &quot;thug life&quot; tattoos. </p>

<p>Some students reportedly saw pictures of party attendees wearing brown face makeup. However, the University said on Wednesday that there had been no confirmation of this. In an e-mail to the student body on Monday afternoon, Fairfield President Father Jeffrey von Arx said that the party &quot;perpetuated racial stereotypes... that only serve to offend and devalue people.&quot;  </p>

<p>Multiple anonymous sources said that another party may have been hosted on Saturday, with a Jersey Shore or &quot;Guido&quot; theme. While a university spokeswoman said that she could not confirm a second party, students cautioned that circulating photos could have been taken at either event. </p>

<p>&quot;I just got out of class, and it was mostly white people in there, and they were saying it was &apos;just a joke,&apos;&quot; a sophomore, who asked to remain anonymous, told us by phone on Tuesday. &quot;But people were really offended, and that&apos;s not a joke. Most of the people here are white, and are blinded by their white privilege.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061331/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/nyregion/off-campus-ghetto-party-condemned-by-fairfield-university.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">The NY Times reports</a> that 78% of Fairfield&apos;s undergraduate full-time students identify as white. About 2% are black and 7% are Latino, according to the Department of Education. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the University confirmed on Monday that the so-called &quot;ghetto party&quot; had taken place off campus, but that students who live off campus &quot;are still required to adhere to the University code of conduct and are subject to University disciplinary action.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="022316_Farfield1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061331im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/022316_Farfield1.jpg" width="300" height="367"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> (via Facebook)</i></div> In a tongue-in cheek apology posted to the Fairfield Class of 2017 Facebook group after the party, Fairfield undergrad Dan Radel, who is listed on the University website as a Junior on the lacrosse team, implicitly accused the party&apos;s critics of being overly sensitive. &quot;In light of the recent backlash towards the &apos;ghetto party,&apos;&quot; he wrote, &quot;I would like to take this time to apologize... I wore a hot dog costume to this party and now feel that my actions have caused emotional harm to all of the hot dog community.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Student Dan Cartolin echoed the sentiment, posting that &quot;We should cancel clam jam too... the clams might get a little upset.&quot; Student Sammi Bongo wondered why &quot;this is such a big deal,&quot; posting that, &quot;for all you know the party could have been a white trash bash. Changes the story a lot doesn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfield University Student Association President Anif McDonald stated on Monday that the party &quot;does not reflect the Jesuit mission of Fairfield University or the deep cultural values that the university stands for.&quot; </p>

<p>Father von Arx confirmed that an investigation into the party is underway, and conceded that the party may be indicative of a deeper-seated problem on campus. &quot;To some within our community, this is symptomatic of conditions on campus that inhibit our many positive efforts to build a more inclusive, respectful and safer community,&quot; he wrote. </p>

<p>According to the University, Fairfield&apos;s Office of Student Diversity and Multiculturalism has been holding extended evening office hours for students hoping to discuss the party, and its ramifications. An emergency student forum is also being planned for this week, and faculty are planning a &quot;dialogue&quot; for the community at large.  </p>

<p>Some students posted on Facebook that they were not surprised by the weekend&apos;s events. &quot;Unfortunately I&apos;d be lying if I said I was surprised at all... especially with the way students responded to the Black Lives Matter assembly,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061331/https://www.facebook.com/AubreyArcane/posts/10154637483822907?pnref=story">posted student Aubrey Sierer on Monday</a>. </p>

<p>After a Black Lives Matter protest on campus in December 2014, several students used the internal chat platform Yik-Yak to criticize the protestors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061331/http://www.hercampus.com/school/fairfield/response-fairfield-students-protests-social-justice">According to the blog Her Campus</a>, students posted comments including &quot;If you want to meet the only liberals on campus, go to the stag now! It&apos;s a rare find,&quot; and &quot;#whitelivesmatter.&quot; </p>

<p>Father von Arx reportedly addressed the protest in a campus-wide e-mail, urging students to &quot;resist the tendency toward angry rhetoric or personal attack.&quot;</p>

<p>The sophomore we spoke with on Tuesday, who identifies as a member of the minority population on campus, said that the undergraduate community has felt particularly divided since this past weekend. &quot;In my circle I have Hispanics, African Americans, Asians. I do talk to the white people, but it&apos;s kind of divided now because of that party,&quot; she added. &quot;People are getting segregated from each other.&quot; </p>

<p>Students and community members are<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803061331/https://www.facebook.com/events/1701517556726906/1701739070038088/"> planning to hold a rally</a> on campus this coming Saturday to support minority students at Fairfield &quot;who must live within this hostile environment.&quot; </p>
