<p>A disgruntled group of daily Long Island Railroad commuters that has been organizing since mid-February under the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/https://twitter.com/hashtag/wedeservebetter?src=hash">#WeDeserveBetter</a>&#x2014;calling out the LIRR for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/02/more_like_li_arent_amirite.php">consistently delayed</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/lirr_lolz.php">overcrowded</a> trains despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://web.mta.info/lirr/about/TicketInfo/Fares03-22-15.htm">hefty</a> monthly ticket rates&#x2014;is staging a fare strike today, in hopes of drawing the MTA&apos;s attention to these grievances. </p>

<p>The strike falls intentionally on the first of the month, when many LIRR riders&apos; monthly passes expire. Participants are also hoping to draw attention to the LIRR&apos;s 2015 annual operating report, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/lirr-trains-on-time-performance-in-2015-worst-since-2000-1.11518391">released in February</a> and shows that LIRR trains were late more often in 2015 than they had been in any of the fifteen years previous. </p>

<p>The LIRR had a record 87.4 million riders in 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/lirr-riders-ranting-on-twitter-planning-march-1-fare-strike-1.11486121">according to Newsday</a>, who navigated a 40% increase in canceled trains, from 843 to 1,260. </p>

<p>In a response to the news outlet, the MTA said that while it is &quot;not satisfied&quot; with this trend, some factors&#x2014;like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/on_a_railway_to_hell.php">certain pair</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/16/stalled_train_causing_heavy_delays.php">century-old train tunnels</a> under the Hudson River&#x2014;are outside of their control. </p>

<p>Last July, the NY Times reported that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/on_a_railway_to_hell.php">1,000 LIRR trains had been delayed</a> in 2015 to date, simply because of congestion moving in and out of Penn Station. </p>

<p>&quot;The service is so degraded and the costs are so high that it&apos;s difficult to tolerate,&quot; said commuter John McCloskey, who lives in Greenlawn, New York and commutes to the city for his advertising job on a $338/month LIRR pass. &quot;We don&apos;t want miracles, we just want to get to work and back again at the scheduled time.&quot; </p>

<p>While the strike technically launched this morning, McClosky said this afternoon that last month&apos;s passes covered this morning&apos;s commute as well. He thinks the strike will have more of an impact this evening. </p>

<p>That said, he&apos;s not expecting many heated confrontations. &quot;We&apos;re not militant,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re asking people who are a <em>bit</em> militant to actually refuse to pay the fare or show a ticket, or buy a single one-way ticket [instead of a March pass].&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Even for the milder activists who only purchase a single ride ticket, it would have the impact of lowering the receipts for the day to get the MTA&apos;s attention,&quot; he added, suggesting that today&apos;s strike could become a monthly occurrence. </p>

<p>John LaPlante, a Long Island resident who identified himself in a message to Gothamist as &quot;the #WeDeserveBetter guy,&quot; said that he has some reservations about the fare strike. &quot;[My] focus is on unifying frustrations and pushing for relevant change and answers, instead of the MTA&apos;s multi-decade long promises of improvements,&quot; he said. &quot;The fare strike.. [could potentially] cause disruptions in the trains and service.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the MTA, there were no reports of fare disputes during the Tuesday morning commute. The authority declined to elaborate on its protocol for passengers who refuse to pay. </p>

<p>&quot;There were no fare disputes reported this morning on the Long Island Rail Road,&quot; said LIRR spokesman Salvatore Arena in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. &quot;If a customer declined to show or pay for a ticket, we are unaware of it, though we are still monitoring the situation. In any event, there was no service impact and we are hoping for the same during the PM Peak.&quot; </p>

<p>Some Queens legislators would like to ease at least the <em>financial</em> burden of a monthly LIRR pass, albeit only for LIRR commuters within NYC. A so-called single-fare &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202221/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/02/mta_freedom_ticket_plan.php">Freedom Ticket</a>&quot; would work for the subway and the commuter rail, and cost 36% less than the combined cost of a $218 monthly LIRR pass and a monthly unlimited $116.50 MetroCard. </p>
