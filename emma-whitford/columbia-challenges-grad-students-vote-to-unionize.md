<p>Less than a month after Columbia University graduate students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/http://www.columbiagradunion.org/">voted to unionize</a>&#x2014;the first private university graduate student group to do so since the National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/national_labor_relations_board_grad.php">enshrined the right</a> in August&#x2014;Columbia is challenging the vote, urging the NLRB to schedule a new election. </p>

<p>Formal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/http://www.columbiagradunion.org/wp-content/uploads/Objections-to-Election-in-Case-No.-02-RC-143012.pdf">objections</a>, made public Monday, accuse organizers with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/https://www.facebook.com/gwcuaw">GWC-UAW</a>&#x2014;the Columbia graduate student chapter of the United Automobile Workers&#x2014;and NLRB agents of participating in various forms of voter suppression. Columbia says union staff stood within 100 feet of a campus polling place on election day, and set up a video camera in an alleged form of surveillance that could have instilled a &quot;reasonable fear of voting against the union.&quot; The school also criticized NLRB agents for running out of challenge ballots&#x2014;which voters fill out if they believe their names have been erroneously omitted from a voter list&#x2014;and for changing its voter ID policy in the days leading up to the December vote. </p>

<p>The final vote was 1,602 to 623 in favor of the union, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/nyregion/columbia-graduate-students-union-vote.html">according to UAW</a>. The union now represents about 3,500 students. </p>

<p>While both Columbia and GWC-UAW have described the challenge as standard procedure, union members say this is the university&apos;s latest attempt to undermine their organizing efforts. </p>

<p>&quot;Employers often file objections as a delay tactic and this appears to be just another baseless effort by the University to ignore the democratic process, especially given the overwhelming margin in favor of the union,&quot; GWC-UAW stated. During a protest Monday, graduate students also accused the school of attempting to stall until President-elect Donald Trump has had a chance to appoint a less labor-friendly NLRB. </p>

<p>They say the concern has historical justification. Back in 2000, a Bill Clinton-appointed NLRB ruled that graduate students at NYU had the right to organize. But in 2004, an NLRB appointed by then-President George W. Bush <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/grad-students-to-the-barricades">overturned the ruling</a>. </p>

<p>Danielle Carr, 26, a second-year PhD candidate in Anthropology, said Columbia took a hard anti-union stance as the vote neared. The school launched a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/https://unionization.provost.columbia.edu/content/be-informed">&quot;Be Informed&quot; website</a>, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829103601/https://unionization.provost.columbia.edu/content/points-view">bank of editorials and press coverage</a> opposing unionization. And when the &apos;yes&apos; vote came down, the school did not approach the union to begin the bargaining process. &quot;If I were a president of a university and saw that the people I claim to support voted &apos;yes&apos; despite a disgusting campaign of misinformation, I would come forward to bargain,&quot; Carr said. &quot;After Trump&apos;s election we got this flurry of emails about how this isn&apos;t what the University stands for, and yet they are so quick to contest, contest, contest.&quot; </p>

<p>The Columbia administration has argued that a union will complicate the unique relationships forged between graduate students and their departments. &quot;I am concerned about the impact of having a non-academic third party involved in the highly individualized and varied contexts in which faculty teach and train students in their departments, classrooms, and laboratories,&quot; said Provost John Coatsworth in an email to students ahead of the vote. </p>

<p>But graduate students and their allies have said these departmental relationships reinforce the need for bargaining power. &quot;Students weren&apos;t being paid on time or weren&apos;t being paid for the number of hours they worked,&quot; said a university staff member who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. &quot;If you are a PhD student, you are working for a department, but that department is also grading you and giving you your degree. They control your whole academic future, so it really puts people in a tough position.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our objections were filed with the NLRB as part of its established procedure for determining whether the conduct of the election was appropriate,&quot; said Columbia spokesman Robert Hornsby in a statement. &quot;We share the NLRB&apos;s goal of ensuring a fair electoral process and protecting the rights of all students.&quot; </p>

<p>In the meantime, Carr said, the union is moving ahead with a student survey to determine bargaining priorities. Aside from fair and timely pay, students have concerns about Columbia&apos;s handling of sexual assault cases, and its ability to accommodate students with disabilities. </p>

<p>&quot;[Columbia] continuously refuses to engage with a fact that the next generation of academia wants to have a union,&quot; she said.  </p>

<p>The NLRB declined comment. </p>
