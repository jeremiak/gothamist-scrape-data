<p>When Cathleen Parra got hired to work the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207083252/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/photos_jazz_age_lawn_party_2016.php#photo-80">Jazz Age Lawn Party</a> on Governor&apos;s Island this summer, she was promised payment within two weeks of the August 13th-14th event. It was so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207083252/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/12/hot_humid_weather_forever.php">swelteringly hot</a> that weekend that Mayor de Blasio warned New Yorkers to stay inside. But the outdoor 1920s-themed dance party went on, and 27-year-old Parra, a burlesque dancer and event planner, worked two days from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., monitoring the dance floor for rowdy guests and working the VIP section. </p>

<p>Then, on August 29th, she got an email from the event&apos;s HR coordinator explaining that due to the heat wave and subsequent unusually low turnout, &quot;we are a tad behind in reconciling our balances.&quot; Parra would be receiving her $300 payment &quot;no later than Sept. 30th, sooner if possible,&quot; the email promised. On September 29th, another email arrived, this time with a message from event founder and orchestra director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207083252/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/fashion/jazz-age-lawn-party-michael-arenella.html?_r=0">Michael Arenella</a>. &quot;We understand your concerns and frustration,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We promise to keep a very open communication as to when these payments are able to go out.&quot; </p>

<p>On Tuesday, November 29th, Parra received another message, but still no compensation. &quot;I apologize at every turn of this and take responsibility for our late payments and assure you it will not be much longer,&quot; Arenella wrote. </p>

<p>&quot;And here we are,&quot; Parra told Gothamist on Wednesday. Parra is one of about 30 workers, including several burlesque performers, who have yet to be paid for their work at the August 2016 JALP. </p>

<p>The event, which charges between $35 and $5,000 per ticket, brought in about 200 workers this August to sell tickets, manage merchandise tables, and serve as crowd control in period costumes. </p>

<p>&quot;I had just quit a job working as an assistant, and the month [after] working the JALP I was in the process of moving. So that money was kind of imperative,&quot; said Trinity Starlight, 34, a burlesque dancer who asked that we use her stage name because she feared retribution. &quot;It put me in a precarious situation moving, and then I was behind paying my phone bill.&quot; </p>

<p>Starlight said she was paid her $300 on October 20th, after numerous follow-up emails with JALP, but was frustrated about the continuing delay in payment for some of her coworkers. &quot;It&apos;s a really beautiful event,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s just sad what I had to take away from that. I get that having a business is difficult, but it&apos;s not like this is his [Arenella&apos;s] first time having this event. It just seemed like he didn&apos;t care.&quot; </p>

<p>Arenella declined to discuss exact finances with Gothamist on Wednesday, but said in a phone interview that his August event had been &quot;completely destroyed&quot; by the heat wave and came in &quot;at a massive loss.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;August was, as you know, one of the biggest heat waves NY has ever seen,&quot; he said. &quot;We had not even a third of our regular attendance at the event, as well as literally no bar sales, which is a lot of our revenue.&quot; </p>

<p>He also challenged worker allegations that JALP has a &quot;pattern&quot; of nonpayment. In 2013, about 50 workers employed by the event caterer went <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207083252/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/jazz_age_lawn_party.php">more than three weeks</a> without compensation. &quot;That was not us,&quot; he said. &quot;That was the caterer we hired.&quot;</p>

<p>Arenella described the JALP as a &quot;labor of love,&quot; saying that the event as a whole is in a &quot;fragile state&quot; financially. He said that &quot;every penny&quot; coming in from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207083252/http://www.dreamlandorchestra.com/">jazz orchestra</a>&apos;s recent wedding and bar mitzvah gigs is going towards paying the workers. The same goes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207083252/http://jazzagelawnparty.ticketfly.com/">Jazz Age Lawn Party Miami</a>, Arenella&apos;s first foray in that city, which is scheduled for the weekend of January 14th and has been in the works since last March. Tickets for that event range from $65 up to $5,000 for VIP packages.  </p>

<p>&quot;Every effort of our work in putting together future events such as JALP Miami is a way to continue to keep revenue coming in&#x2014;this is how we are working toward being able to pay you,&quot; Arenella wrote in his November 29th email to workers. </p>

<p>But Starlight said that the broken promises preceding her eventual compensation grated on her trust. &quot;The fact that they kept saying, &apos;Okay, you should get paid before this date,&apos; and then another date&#x2014;at that point I felt like I was getting the runaround.&quot;</p>
