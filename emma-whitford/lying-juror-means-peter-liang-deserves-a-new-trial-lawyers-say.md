(Mary Altaffer / Pool)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Attorneys for former NYPD Officer Peter Liang, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/11/nypd_cop_found_verdict.php">found guilty</a> of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/tags/akaigurley">Akai Gurley</a>, are seeking a retrial on the basis of alleged juror misconduct. </p>

<p>According to attorney Paul Schectman&#x2014;who joined Liang&apos;s defense team after the verdict was read in February&#x2014;one of the jurors did not disclose during selection that his father served prison time for a manslaughter charge. </p>

<p>The juror in question, 62-year-old Michael Vargas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/akai-gurley-jurors-express-shock-da-request-no-jail-article-1.2578181">told the Daily News</a> anonymously late last month that his father had served seven years in prison for accidentally shooting a friend. </p>

<p>Vargas also joined some of his fellow jurors in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/26/jurors_in_peter_liang_trial_cant_be.php">criticizing</a> Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/23/brooklyn_da_recommends_no_jail_time.php">recommendation</a> that Liang get five years of probation, but no prison time. &quot;They [NYPD officers] deserve to be prosecuted and sentenced just like everyone else who has the same background or committed the same crime,&quot; Vargas said, adding, &quot;if something is wrong, you shouldn&apos;t get a slap on the wrist.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the retrial motion, Vargas&apos;s &quot;deliberately false answer&quot; during jury selection was designed to &quot;secure him a place on the jury, which would not have been his had he given a truthful answer.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Vargas&apos;s falsehood was not accidental or inconsequential,&quot; the motion states. &quot;It was a major lie. What his father was convicted of was... the very crime for which Mr. Liang was on trial&#x2014;manslaughter involving an unintentional shooting.&quot; </p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/nyregion/lawyers-for-peter-liang-allege-jury-misconduct-in-manslaughter-trial.html?_r=0">an interview with the NY Times</a> on Tuesday, Vargas countered that he had been raised in orphanages and boy&apos;s homes, and had never lived with his father, Noberto Vargas. &quot;It didn&apos;t cross my mind to think about him [during jury selection] because he wasn&#x2019;t an important person in my life,&quot; Vargas said.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Peter-Liang-Convicted-NYPD-Officer-Manslaughter-Lawyer-Seeks-Retrial-374662641.html">said in a statement</a>, &quot;Peter Liang received a fair trial and we will respond to the motion in court.&quot; A hearing for the retrial motion hasn&apos;t been scheduled yet.</p>

<p>Liang shot Gurley while performing a vertical patrol in a darkened stairwell of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/pink_houses_nycha_gurley.php">Pink Houses in East New York</a> in November of 2014. Gurley was unarmed.</p>

<p>Last month, Liang&apos;s lawyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/attorneys_move_to_overturn_manslaug.php">filed a separate motion</a> to overturn the convictions on the grounds that the rookie cop did not receive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/liang_nypd_cpr_class.php">adequate CPR training</a>.</p>

<p>Liang is the first NYPD officer to be put on trial for killing a civilian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121123/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/25/sean_bell_shoot_7.php">since 2008</a>, and the first to be found guilty of killing a civilian in decades. He is scheduled for sentencing on April 14th, and faces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison.</p>
