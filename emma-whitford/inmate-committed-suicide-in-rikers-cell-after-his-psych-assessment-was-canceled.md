<p>A 24-year-old man hanged himself in his Rikers holding cell this week, after jail staff canceled his scheduled psychological assessment. Jairo Polanco Munoz was being held on $750 bail, and awaiting trial for allegedly stealing a cellphone at a West Village McDonalds. He had attempted suicide the previous spring while incarcerated&#x2014;an incident that was reportedly in his medical records. </p>

<p>&quot;All someone had to do was review the chart,&quot; a medical staffer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040440/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rikers-inmate-killed-mental-health-check-article-1.2568785">told the News</a>. Munoz was discovered in his cell around 9:45 p.m. on Monday, two and a half days after his arrest. The Department of Correction confirmed that an investigation into the death is underway. </p>

<p>According to the tabloid, a medical officer did a preliminary health check with Munoz when he was admitted to Rikers last Friday, and suggested that he get a more detailed psychological assessment within 72 hours. Then the jail went into lockdown because of an inmate-involved stabbing, and the appointment was canceled. Munoz remained with the general prison population instead of moving over to suicide watch. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040440/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/mount_vernon_jail_death.php">announced the results</a> of a special investigation into the death of Raynette Turner, a 42-year-old Westchester County woman who died in police custody while awaiting trial for a petty larceny arrest (the mother of eight allegedly stole a box of crab legs from a wholesale grocery store). The AG&apos;s office did not find the Mount Vernon Police Department criminally culpable, but questioned the department&apos;s vigilance in checking medical records. </p>
