<p>The majority of LGBTQ New Yorkers who have filed complaints with the city alleging police brutality or misconduct in the last five years are black and Hispanic, according to a new report [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/file:///Users/gothamist2015a/Downloads/LGBTQ%20Report%20(1).pdf">PDF</a>] on LGBTQ-related complaints from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/http://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/html/home/home.shtml">Civilian Complaint Review Board</a>. </p>

<p>Nearly 50% of LGBTQ complainants are black, 34% Hispanic, 16% white and about 1% Asian. In one substantiated complaint from 2013, an officer called a civilian a &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;faggot-ass&quot; and told him to &quot;go back to the hood.&quot; </p>

<p>While the majority of complaints regard incidents that took place in the West Village, many complaints were also filed in the 73rd, 75th, and 77th Precincts, encompassing sections of Crown Heights and East New York. </p>

<p>&quot;Routinely we see trans women being stopped and accused of engaging in sex work, and they&apos;re just walking down the street,&quot; said Shelby Chestnut, director of community organizing at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/http://www.avp.org/">New York City Anti-Violence Project</a>. &quot;We&apos;re seeing this predominantly happening to LGBTQ people of color. The allegations people make to us correlate exactly with this report.&quot; </p>

<p>The CCRB assessed 466 complaints filed between 2010 and 2015 in which the alleged victim explicitly described misconduct related to sexual orientation, or alleged the use of slurs related to sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. </p>

<p>92% of officers accused of LGBTQ-related misconduct in the last five years are male. Half of them are white and nearly 75% are beat cops. </p>

<p>Fully-investigated CCRB complaints included 950 allegations, of which 74 were substantiated and 559 (about 60%) were unsubstantiated&#x2014;a statistic the NYPD has since emphasized. </p>

<p>&quot;The vast majority of these complaints were unsubstantiated or unfounded, and more than 20 percent of investigations resulted in an exoneration,&quot; NYPD spokesman J. Peter Donald said in a statement. </p>

<p>Report authors noted that the majority of the unsubstantiated allegations involved offensive language, and lacked supporting audio evidence. The report recommends that the NYPD&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/29/nypd_body_cams_survey.php">pilot body camera program</a> prioritize cataloguing audio recordings as well as video, since audio is often key in determining if an officer has used an offensive slur. </p>

<p>Fred Ginyard, director of organizing for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/http://www.fiercenyc.org/">FIERCE</a>, an LGBTQ advocacy group that works primarily with youth of color, added that the statistics don&apos;t account for alleged victims of police brutality who don&apos;t come forward with allegations, for fear of retribution. He&apos;d like the CCRB to add an option for anonymous complaint filing. </p>

<p>&quot;What does it mean for community members who make complaints to the CCRB but then have to deal with that same officer in their community?&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Since 2012, the NYPD Patrol Guide has prohibited the use of slurs related to gender expression or sexual orientation. </p>

<p>The Patrol Guide also prohibits frisking, searching, or strip searching a suspect to determine their genitalia and, in doing so, assign a sex to that person. A 30-page lesson in the Police Academy curriculum titled &#x201C;Policing a Multicultural Society&#x201D; includes basic LGBTQ sensitivity training. </p>

<p>But LGBTQ activists have challenged that the Patrol Guide doesn&apos;t include explicit consequences for a violation. Between 2010 and 2015, 856 LGBT complaints included allegations that officers used slurs including &quot;faggot,&quot; &quot;queer,&quot; &quot;homo,&quot; &quot;tranny,&quot; &quot;he-she,&quot; and &quot;dyke.&quot; The CCRB has also received three complaints regarding sexually abusive searches in the last five years. </p>

<p>The CCRB acknowledged last week that it did not explicitly monitor police misconduct against members of the LGBTQ community until quite recently&#x2014;before last December, complaint forms didn&apos;t even include an option for complainants or victims to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity. Now, complainants can choose between male, female, transman (FTM), transwoman (MTF), or &quot;not described.&quot; Alleged victims can also provide a preferred name on the CCRB form, if it differs from the name on their state-issued identification. (Historically, the CCRB <em>has</em> monitored complaints related to &quot;sexual orientation,&quot; which helped in collecting data for this report.) </p>

<p>&quot;This is a topic that historically has needed more focus and attention,&quot; conceded CCRB Executive Director Mina Malik in a statement. </p>

<p>The report recommends that LGBTQ organizations like the Anti-Violence Project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/https://www.glaad.org/">GLAAD</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/http://www.thetaskforce.org/">National LGBTQ Task Force</a> step in to assess the NYPD&apos;s new LGBTQ sensitivity training curriculum, and that the city independently audit the department&apos;s adherence to the Patrol Guide. From the report: </p>

<blockquote>There should also be an assessment of what Academy students have actually learned about their own biases, how seriously these students are taking the trainings, and whether these students have effectively identified the ways in which they need to put aside their own biases.</blockquote>

<p>Chestnut said on Monday that the report is timely, on the heels of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/approximately_20_people_killed_at_g.php">massacre at a gay night club in Orlando</a> and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164717/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/nypd_counter-terrorism_units_on_ale.php">subsequent decision</a> to ramp up the police presence at NYC&apos;s Pride Parade, and LGBTQ landmarks like the Stonewall Inn. </p>

<p>&quot;Increased presence isn&apos;t making anyone feel safer,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s making them more fearful.&quot;  </p>

<p>Chestnut also praised the CCRB&apos;s suggestion that the city audit the NYPD&apos;s adherence to its own LGBTQ guidelines. &quot;Right now there&apos;s no way to track that they&apos;re being adhered to,&quot; she said. &quot;And based on this report I would say that they haven&apos;t been.&quot; </p>
