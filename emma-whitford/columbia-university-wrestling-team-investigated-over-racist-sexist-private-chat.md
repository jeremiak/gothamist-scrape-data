<p>The sort of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/20/trump_koi_soho_worker.php">racist</a> and sexist language that President-elect Donald Trump has uttered in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/mr_misogyny.php">public</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">private</a>&#x2014;which he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">dismissed</a> as &quot;locker room talk&quot;&#x2014;clogs a private group chat between Senior members of the Columbia University wrestling team that leaked this week. Screenshots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://bwog.com/2016/11/10/messages-from-wrestling-team-groupme-reveal-culture-of-intolerance/">acquired by the Columbia news outlet Bwog</a> show texts dating back to 2014, and some as recent as last week, that are peppered with racist, homophobic and sexist slurs, as well as jokes about rape. </p>

<p>&quot;Columbia bitches feel entitled to something when In reality [sic] they are all ugly socially awkward cunts,&quot; one 2014 message from the GroupMe chat reads. In another chat decrying the cancellation of Columbia&apos;s biannual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/https://www.facebook.com/CUBacchanal/">Bacchanal party</a> someone writes, &quot;I hope someone actually gets sexually assaulted...&quot; </p>

<p>Other messages use an abbreviation of the word nigger while discussing protests in Ferguson, Missouri following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/10/michael_brown_march.php#photo-1">murder of Ferguson man Michael Brown</a> by a police officer. </p>

<p>&quot;[D]id you see any of those nigs in North St Louis protesting that teenager getting shot by cops,&quot; one reads.</p>

<p>Racist language is also directed at black women with whom some of the players say they have &quot;fucked.&quot; In general, the players demean women who attend Columbia, favoring state schools where, one person writes, &quot;every girl begs for the cock so hard.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We chose to post the screenshots without names because we believe the messages that were sent are part of a greater issue,&quot; Bwog editors wrote. The text chain was also reportedly peppered with photographs of women, which have been redacted. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bwog has received screenshots from a Wrestling team GroupMe that reveal a culture of hatred and intolerance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/https://t.co/Cehtd5nTa3">https://t.co/Cehtd5nTa3</a></p>&#x2014; Bwog (@bwog) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/https://twitter.com/bwog/status/796850041025626112">November 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Columbia University did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but Bwog reports that the school has launched an internal investigation into the chats. The team&apos;s season opener, against Binghamton University, has been canceled. </p>

<p>&quot;Columbia University has zero tolerance in its athletics programs for the group messaging and texts sent by several members of the men&#x2019;s varsity wrestling team,&quot; the school told Bwog. &quot;They are appalling, at odds with the core values of the University, violate team guidelines, and have no place in our community.&quot; </p>

<p>No Red Tape, a Columbia student group whose stated mission is to &quot;end sexual and domestic violence in our campus communities,&quot; issued a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://noredtapecu.org/blog/2016/11/10/on-the-columbia-wrestling-team">scathing statement this week</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Bwog&apos;s recent uncovering of GroupMe messages sent by the Columbia Men&#x2019;s Wrestling team provides a glaring depiction of the reality of hate and ignorance on this campus&#x2014;a reality that is hard to accept for many of us,&quot; they said, adding, &quot;Sexual assault is not a joke and should never be dismissed as one.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the group, Columbia University is tied for the second-most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://projects.chronicle.com/titleix/investigations/?search_term=Columbia+University">open Title IX investigations</a> in the country. </p>

<p>For those seeking an outlet to protest the misogynistic language and racist attitudes that Trump embodies, there are several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215054/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/trump_protest_nyc.php">large-scale protests</a> planned this weekend. </p>
