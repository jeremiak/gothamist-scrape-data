<p>Democratic State Senator Tony Avella, Mayor Bill de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/22/tony_avella_interview.php">car-loving challenger of less than five months</a>, announced Thursday that he is dropping out of the 2017 mayoral race. The candidate from Queens cited insufficient funding, cramming his press release with jabs at de Blasio&apos;s own fundraising habits. &quot;I knew that I was facing an uphill battle if I wanted to topple an incumbent mayor with deep pockets,&quot; Avella said, adding, &quot;Five months later... I have found that staying in this race without being beholden to dark money is becoming increasingly difficult.&quot; </p>

<p>To recap, the remaining crew of challengers includes Republican real estate mogul <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/04/finally_a_business-friendly_mayor_r.php">Paul Massey</a>, Staten Island Republican Assembly Member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170502/grant-city/nicole-malliotakis-mayoral-election-john-catsimatidis">Nicole Malliotakis</a> (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/06/republicans_sue_to_inflict_pain.php">recently sued the city</a> over its attempt to destroy NYCID data), and former New York Jet Republican Michael Faulkner (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/nyregion/nyc-mayor-candidates-bo-dietl.html">the NY Times reports</a> has spent more on the campaign than he has raised). On the Democratic ticket, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170406/civic-center/robert-gangi-police-reform-mayor-de-blasio-primary-race">police reform advocate Bob Gangi</a>, and former City Council Member Sal Albanese. Bo Dietl spent the last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/27/nyc_republican_mayoral_hopefuls_bas.php">insisting that he didn&apos;t say anything racist</a> at a Republican candidate forum (the candidate said a black female judge &quot;looked like Chirlane de Blasio&quot;). Today, the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/nyregion/bo-dietl-republican-mayor.html?_r=0">reports</a> that the Republican Party doesn&apos;t want him to run on their party line. </p>

<p>For the mayor who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/16/us_attorneys_office_announces_no_ch.php">recently dodged criminal charges</a> and seizes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/de_blasio_trump_immigrants.php">every</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/22/come_to_new_york_and_tell_nypd_offi.php">opportunity</a> to look less terrible than the Trump Administration, things appear to be rather rosy. </p>

<p>Then-candidate Avella told us in December that he was skeptical of Mayor de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/tags/visionzero">Vision Zero initiative</a>. Safe Streets advocates have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/24/vision_zero_report.php">criticized the program</a> for not cracking down hard enough on drivers. Avella&apos;s position is about the opposite: he described the mayor as &quot;sort of anti-motorist with his policies, there is no question.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All he is focusing on is the pedestrian plazas and bike lanes,&quot; Avella added. &quot;And I&apos;ve told him time and time again that if you really want to improve safety, you need to do more than that. It&apos;s also about making it easier for neighborhoods that identify dangerous intersections to get an all-way stop or a traffic light. If a neighborhood asks for a speed bump, do you know how long it takes?&quot; </p>

<p>According to Avella, &quot;Buying a car, having a car, is the last bastion of freedom.&quot; </p>

<p>A member of Albany&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504185311/http://gothamist.com/tags/idc">controversial Independent Democratic Conference</a>, Avella assured supporters that he &quot;will not stop fighting against the current Mayor.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Throughout my career in government I have prided myself on being an outsider who made it to the inside and got things done,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, in a race like this, being an outsider doesn&apos;t get you much.&quot; </p>
