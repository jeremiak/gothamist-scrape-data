<p>A woman was out jogging in Snug Harbor on the north shore of Staten Island on Monday morning when a man approached her from behind, covered her mouth, and attempted to rape her, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>The victim, whose name has not been released, managed to escape the attacker and call for help. The suspect fled, and was arrested after a brief search. </p>

<p>According to the police, the 39-year-old woman was jogging past the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden at 1000 Richmond Terrace around 9:05 a.m. on Monday when she was attacked. The suspect, 39-year-old Denis Hernandez of New Brighton, Staten Island, approached her from behind and allegedly covered her mouth with his hand. He then inserted an &quot;unknown object&quot; into her mouth to stifle her cries, and attempted to drag her into the woods, according to police. </p>

<p>The woman, who cops say was visiting New York from outside the country, managed to break free and run for help, quickly calling 911 with a description of her attacker. </p>

<p>Hernandez was arrested a few blocks from the scene, at the corner of Fillmore and Tysen streets. He&apos;s charged with attempted rape, assault, kidnapping, and unlawful imprisonment. </p>

<p>The victim was treated at Richmond University Medical Center, but cops said she didn&apos;t sustain any serious injuries. </p>

The NYPD has since released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131738/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/03/police_release_new_video_of_suspect.php">video showing the suspect</a>, as well as a sketch. </p>
