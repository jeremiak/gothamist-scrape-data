<p>As of 9:00 this morning, there is no B train service between Brighton Beach and Bedford Park Boulevard in both directions. Southbound D trains are running on the C line from 59th Street to West 4th Street, and then over the F line to Coney Island. Northbound D trains are terminating at 36th Street in Brooklyn. R trains are running on the N line between Atlantic-Barclays and Canal Street in both directions, and &quot;some&quot; southbound N and Q trains are terminating at Canal Street. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Con Edison told Gothamist that crews have been dispatched to the intersection of DeKalb and Fulton Streets, following reports of a &quot;voltage dip.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, expect &quot;extensive delays&quot; on the C, F, N, Q, R, and W trains. In the words of the MTA, &quot;allow additional travel time.&quot; At least it&apos;s not Monday? </p>
