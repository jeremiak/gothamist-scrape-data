<p>Anti-police violence organization <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/https://www.facebook.com/events/959630214065046/">Millions March NYC</a> this morning began <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/https://www.facebook.com/events/603110703195862/">occupying City Hall Park in Downtown Manhattan</a>, demanding NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton&apos;s immediate resignation and an end to his signature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/broken_windows_still_racist.php">Broken Windows policing</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re not targets,&quot; Millions March organizer Cleo Jeffryes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/14/city_hall_park_occupation.php">told us last month</a>, when the occupation was announced. &quot;We&apos;re human beings. Bill Bratton is a racist and a bigot who&apos;s done so much to harm the black and brown community.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="080116_BLM3.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/080116_BLM3.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Jen Chung / Gothamist) </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Timing the action to coincide with the two-year anniversary of the shooting of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/10/michael_brown_march.php#photo-1">Michael Brown, an unarmed black man</a>, in Ferguson, Missouri, occupiers are also demanding reparations for victims of police brutality out of the NYPD budget. Finally, the group is demanding that City Hall reinvest the NYPD&apos;s $5.5 billion budget in working-class communities of color. </p>

<p>&quot;Organizers plan to occupy space until demands are met,&quot; Millions March stated last week. </p>

<p>According to Jeffryes, the occupation is inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-blm-city-hall-20160713-snap-story.html">similar protests in Los Angeles</a> that have called for the resignation of police chief Charlie Beck. </p>

<p>Organizers will conduct medical training to prepare for tear gas deployment, and plan to set up a kitchen and an Amazon account to get donations if the occupation holds overnight. Staying through the night is technically a violation of the park&apos;s midnight curfew. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="080117_BLM2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/080117_BLM2.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Jen Chung / Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Shut Down City Hall NYC officially began at 9:00 a.m. We observed between three and four dozen occupiers about an hour into the occupation, and nearly 60 by 10:45 a.m. There were several dozen police officers in and around the park&#x2014;at least eight of them white shirts. The mood was calm, as protesters unfurled banners and set up tables laden with Black Lives Matter and &quot;Rise Up!&quot; pins, and issues of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://www.socialistalternative.org/">Socialist Alternative</a>. </p>

<p>Shortly before 11:00 a.m., organizers gathered to state their demands and addressed the steadily-expanding group of occupiers about their legal rights. Speakers called for the &quot;abolition&quot; of policing. </p>

<p>&quot;Policing is a violent, anti-Black institution that originated as slave patrols,&quot; Millions March writes in its guide to this week&apos;s action, adding, &quot;we fight for the abolition of policing and prisons and will not be fooled or derailed by fake reforms like <a href="gothamist.com/2016/06/29/nypd_body_cams_survey.php">body cameras</a> and so called community policing, which further increase the budget and power of the racist and brutal NYPD.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They [police] enforce the white supremacists&apos; hierarchy,&quot; Vienna Rye, 24, an organizer with Millions March, told the crowd. An older woman interrupted repeatedly with shouts of &quot;Kill the killers!&quot; and organizers stepped up, urging her not to interrupt the planned address. </p>

<p>Around noon, a 35-year-old man from Queens in a Black Lives Matter t-shirt started a chant of &quot;All Lives Matter!&quot; (&quot;Not only black lives.&quot;). He then modified his chant to join a group of surrounding occupiers: &quot;All lives matter, when black lives matter!&quot;</p>

<p>This week&apos;s occupation was announced in mid-July, soon after Commissioner Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/11/bratton_sit_down_be_quiet.php">criticized the Black Lives Matter movement on talk radio</a>, charging that protesters were unfairly targeting police and, rather than engaging with dialogue with said police, &quot;engaging in protests where there is a lot of yelling and screaming.&quot; In the weeks since, Bratton has announced that he will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://www.wsj.com/articles/nypd-commissioner-william-bratton-to-step-down-by-late-2017-1469484594">step down from his post</a> by late next year. </p>

<p>&quot;He needs to go now,&quot; said Rye. &quot;So many black and brown people are in [jail at] Rikers because they didn&apos;t have $2.75 in subway fare. Meanwhile killer cops are on paid leave.&quot;</p>

<p>By focusing on low-level quality of life issues like excessive noise and public drinking, Bratton has argued, the NYPD can deter more serious crimes like assault and murder. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/broken_windows_stats.php">A recent Department of Investigation report</a> cuts against the assumptions, finding no demonstrable link between low-level arrests and felonious crime. Meanwhile, Broken Windows policing is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/broken_windows_still_racist.php">disproportionately applied</a> against African-American and Hispanic New Yorkers. </p>

<p>Kenneth Shelton, 20, from Queens, arrived early on Monday, to show support before heading to work at the Campaign Finance Board. &quot;We want money in our communities instead of in police,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Organizers clarified Monday that events have been scheduled for the late afternoon and evening to accommodate people who aren&apos;t able to occupy during the day. Tonight, occupiers will rally at the park at 6:00 p.m. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/https://www.facebook.com/events/603110703195862/">Facebook event for the occupation</a> has more details on protocol, protesters&apos; rights, and court and jail support. Here&apos;s a link [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/http://media.wix.com/ugd/881d51_12abc618efc746b0bc72a4fe47b6c90e.pdf">PDF</a>] to the occupation orientation guide. Participants are tweeting with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShutDownCityHallNYC?src=hash">#SHUTDOWNCITYHALLNYC</a>.</p>

<p>The occupation is explicitly disassociated from any potentially-sympathetic politicians. &quot;Millions March NYC does not support, endorse, or organize with any person or group that works, in any capacity, for or within the system,&quot; the group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030701/https://www.facebook.com/events/603110703195862/permalink/611087012398231/">wrote on Facebook Monday</a>. &quot;Including but not limited to politicians, elected &amp; non-elected government officials, &amp; other political figures &amp; establishment types.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;New York City has a longstanding history of supporting public expression, and we believe in all New Yorkers&#x2019; rights to peacefully make their voices heard,&quot; said Mayoral Spokeswoman Monica Klein on Monday. &quot;Our city&apos;s parks are for the public to enjoy, and NYPD will be on hand to make sure the area is safe and that access is not disrupted by these demonstrations.&quot; </p>
