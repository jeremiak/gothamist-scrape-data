<p>An officer from the 1st Precinct talked an elderly man off of a narrow beam on the 22nd floor of a Tribeca high-rise on Wednesday afternoon, according to the NYPD. The 73-year-old man, whose name has not been released by police, was threatening to jump to his death before the cop began speaking to him in Mandarin. </p>

<p>Police responded to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161359/http://401broadway.com/about/">401 Broadway</a>, a 335-foot-tall Art Deco office building on the corner of Walker Street in Tribeca, at 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday. There, they discovered the 73-year-old man balancing on a steel beam across an air shaft on the 22nd floor. </p>

Cops pulled the man to safety around 6:30 p.m., after a four hour negotiation. He was hospitalized, but without any serious injuries. </p>

<p>The News also reports that the man was wanted in connection with the beating death of his girlfriend, 61-year-old Huizhen Zhan, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161359/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-found-dead-queens-apartment-fatal-blow-head-article-1.2736754">discovered dead in her basement apartment</a> on Monday, with head trauma. Zhan&apos;s death was declared a homicide on Wednesday following an autopsy, according to the tabloid. The man was apparently in Tribeca to see his lawyer at 401 Broadway. </p>

<p>&quot;The old man&apos;s such a nice person, not an angry person. It&apos;s hard to believe he could kill [her],&quot; a neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161359/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/man-threatens-jump-22nd-floor-nypd-talks-article-1.2737615">told the tabloid</a>. </p>

<p>NYPD sources declined to comment on these allegations, saying only that Zhan&apos;s death is still under investigation. No charges had been filed against the man as of Thursday morning. </p>
