										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="020516_Bernie.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/020516_Bernie.jpeg" width="300" height="225"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block">Gedrich (via Facebook)</i></div> A 23-year-old clothing store manager from New Jersey was one of two women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958/http://nypost.com/2016/02/05/sanders-supporters-banned-from-tinder-after-campaigning-on-app/">banned from Tinder</a> this week, after she spent two weeks constantly swiping right and plying her matches with one simple message over and over and over again: &#x201C;Do you feel the bern? Please text WORK to 82623 for me. Thanks!&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>In terms of scale, Robyn Gedrich confirmed that she sent her copy-and-pasted endorsement about 60 times a day for fourteen days, prompting many people to assume she was a bot and report her to the app. Men who heeded Gedrich&apos;s request got campaign updates and Bernie volunteer signup links in return, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958/http://nypost.com/2016/02/05/sanders-supporters-banned-from-tinder-after-campaigning-on-app/">according to Reuters</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;We whole-heartedly support people sharing their political views on Tinder, but we don&apos;t allow spamming. So feel free to spread the Bern, just don&apos;t spam,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the app on Friday. </p>

<p>But a bot, Gedrich is not. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="020516_Bernie2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/020516_Bernie2.jpeg" width="300" height="257"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block">A screenshot from Bernie Sanders&apos; Dank Tinder Convos</i></div> &quot;These guys are disgusting. They&#x2019;re just looking for sex and that&#x2019;s it,&#x201D; Gedrich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958/http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/women-are-using-tinder-to-campaign-for-bernie-sanders?bffbnews&amp;utm_term=.sc1eygRgop#.faDygYxYwX">told BuzzFeed</a> this week. &#x201C;So if they&#x2019;re going to swipe right, they might as well do some good and donate to the man, the myth, the legend, Bernie.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Gedrich has been unable to log back into the app since Thursday, but campaigning with potential one night stands hasn&apos;t yet proven problematic for plenty of other people, whose (sincere?) Bernie love is crowding <a href="Bernie Sanders&apos; Dank Tinder Convos">Bernie Sanders&apos; Dank Tinder Convos</a> and a Tumblr called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958/http://tindcamp.tumblr.com/">Tinder Campaigning</a>. </p>

<p>Granted, reviews have been mixed, ranging on the latter from &quot;go trump&quot; to &quot;lol I don&apos;t vote.&quot;</p>

<p>But since yesterday, Gedrich&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958/https://www.facebook.com/robyn.gedrich">Facebook wall</a> has been stacked with links to blog posts about her tinder proselytizing. All told, that&apos;s pretty damn millennial, or at least more millennial than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025958/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/bill_clinton_brooklyn_bowl.php">shelling out $250 to schmooze with Bill Clinton at the Brooklyn Bowl</a>. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Reached by phone on Friday, Gedrich confirmed that she is still unable to log into Tinder, but is considering making a new Facebook account in order to get back on the app for Bernie. </p>

<p>&quot;What I like about Bernie is the fact that he thinks that higher education is so important,&quot; said Gedrich, who used to study marketing at LIM College in NYC. &quot;I had to drop out of college because I couldn&apos;t afford it anymore. I find it so important that he finds [higher education] important, and equality and kicking out corruption in the government.&quot; </p>

<p>Asked why Tinder was her chosen medium, Gedrich explained that it had proven an easy way to campaign on top of her full time retail job. &quot;If I could I would definitely want to go out and campaign, but I couldn&apos;t get off work,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>As for the Dank Tinder Convos, Gedrich said she didn&apos;t know anything about them until yesterday. &quot;I don&apos;t know if they are trying to be serious or just trying to be funny, and I don&apos;t want to be associated with being a joke because it&apos;s a serious issue for me,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>If Gedrich does manage to get back on Tinder, she says she&apos;ll take a different approach. &quot;I could have gotten a bit more personal with it,&quot; she admitted. &quot;But that&apos;s just my personality.&quot; </p>
