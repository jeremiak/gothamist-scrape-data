<p>Trucks rumbled along the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/02/bqe_decay_repair_project.php">crumbling triple cantilever section of the Brooklyn Queens Expressway</a> Friday afternoon as NYC Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg implored state legislators to pass a bill she believes could shave two years and millions of dollars off of critical repairs. Unless a streamlined &quot;design-build&quot; process is approved in the next 11 days, she argued, a long-overdue overhaul to the high-traffic roadway could get further bogged down in bureaucracy. </p>

<p>&quot;We really need to get moving,&quot; Trottenberg said. &quot;The structure is safe at the moment but it&apos;s not something where I can wait years and years. We&apos;ve been up in Albany for a few years now trying to make this case.&quot; </p>

<p>Supporters of design-build say the process holds engineers and construction firms accountable by forcing them to bid jointly on contracts. Currently, New York City seeks a designer for a project, then puts out a separate bid for construction. &quot;I have one company that does my design, and then I hand that to a separate company [for construction],&quot; Trottenberg said. &quot;That separate company is allowed to say, &apos;Well that design had problems.&apos;&quot; This can lead to delays and lawsuits, she said. </p>

<p>&quot;Timing is critical,&quot; added Department of Design and Construction Commissioner Feniosky Pe&#xF1;a-Mora. &quot;If we don&apos;t get it now, we may miss the opportunity to be able to use design-build on this project. Because we will have to move forward with a design firm [soon].&quot; </p>

<p>The BQE rehab project already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/48/all_bqerepairsnub_2011_12_02_bk.html">hit a major snag in 2011</a>, when the State Department of Transportation backed out. Topped with the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, the steel and concrete structure supports three lanes of Queens-bound traffic, which jut over three lanes of Staten Island bound traffic. Designed by Robert Moses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/the_brooklyn_promenade.php">and constructed in 1948</a>, the network of roadways has already surpassed its intended 50 year lifespan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/32/19/32_19_mm_bqe_meeting.html">by more than a decade</a>.</p>

<p>According to the city, design-build would shave $300 million off of an earmarked $1.89 billion in DOT and Parks Department funding for the BQE overhaul. It would also push up the estimated completion date two years, to 2022, according to DOT. </p>

<p>Recent state-run design-build projects include the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/13/governor_cuomo_will_light_up_kosciu.php">Kosciuszko Bridge</a>, and the Tappan Zee Bridge. The process is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://www.constructiondive.com/news/construction-industry-trends-2017/433151/">gaining momentum</a> across the country. </p>

<p>Opponents of design-build include upstate labor unions who argue the streamlining process could marginalize their rights and benefits, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170120/REAL_ESTATE/170129987">Crain&apos;s reports</a>. Public employee unions have also pushed back, demanding that approved projects include explicit protections of their bargaining rights. The State Society of Professional Engineers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/http://nysspe.org/2015/06/08/nysspe-june-2015-position-statement-on-design-build-proposal/">has argued</a> that engineers could lose autonomy under the process. </p>

<p>But local union organizations&#x2014;including the NYC Central Labor Council and the NY Building Congress&#x2014;support design-build, which also has the endorsement of good government groups. &quot;So much of this city was built up to 50, 80, 100 years ago,&quot; Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, told reporters on Friday. &quot;It is deteriorating. It is aging. We need to make sure the limited funds we have for infrastructure get stretched as much as possible.&quot; </p>

<p>Republican State Senator Marty Golden introduced legislation this session that would secure design-build for the BQE, one of eight projects NYC has prioritized, including the Rodman&apos;s Neck NYPD training facility and a new NYPD Precinct in Southeast Queens. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m working with Senator [Daniel] Squadron to at least help us get out the BQE and Rodman&apos;s Neck,&quot; Golden said Friday. &quot;We&apos;re going to hopefully come up with a compromise, [but] we have a lot of work to do.&quot; (The bipartisan support is unusual, a spokesman for Squadron, a Democrat, noted.) </p>

<p>Governor Cuomo&apos;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mayor de Blasio, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170847/https://therealdeal.com/2017/01/23/de-blasio-urges-building-congress-to-pressure-albany-to-expand-design-build-to-nyc/">long endorsed</a> design-build for the BQE, stated Friday that, &quot;We have serious capital needs that cannot wait for an emergent crisis.&quot; </p>

<p>Senator Squadron, who represents Brooklyn Heights, said Friday that considering Albany&apos;s track record, action now is critical. </p>

<p>&quot;The normal session ends in three weeks time,&quot; he said. &quot;After that there&apos;s no way to get this authorization until the beginning of next year. And the way this works in Albany, everyone says, &apos;Let&apos;s wait until the end of the budget&apos; ... and if it doesn&apos;t happen in the budget, everyone says, &apos;Alright, by end of session.&apos; And before you know it you&apos;re thirteen months from today.&quot; </p>

<p>Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon predicted the wait could be disastrous. &quot;This roadway is being beaten up all the time and it&apos;s not going to continue to last,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to build a shorter nightmare, rather than a longer one.&quot; </p>
