<p>Days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111402/http://chicagoist.com/2017/04/10/video_man_screams_as_he_is_forcibly.php">video went viral</a> of security officers at Chicago O&apos;Hare International Airport violently dragging a passenger off of an overbooked United flight, Port Authority Police Officers pledged never to forcefully remove a passenger from an overbooked flight in New York or New Jersey. </p>

<p>The PAPD guidelines were distributed during roll call this week, according to the Port Authority. </p>

<p>&quot;PAPD will not assist in the physical removal of the passenger from the flight to accommodate the airline&apos;s request,&quot; said PAPD Supt. Michael Fedorko in a policy statement. &quot;If/when an airline representative calls your respective command for such assistance, the Tour Commander or Commanding Officer will inform the airline this is an internal, non-law enforcement related matter and the PAPD will not respond to this type of request.&quot; </p>

<p>Port Authority Police monitor Newark, JFK, and LaGuardia airports. These orders reiterate existing protocol, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111402/http://nypost.com/2017/04/13/port-authority-cops-pledge-they-wont-yank-people-off-planes/">NY Post reports</a>. </p>

<p>Video from the United Flight shows two security officers grab a screaming Dr. David Dao out of his seat, and pulling him by the arms down the plane isle. His glasses appear to be broken, and a woman is heard shouting, &quot;My God, what are you doing? Oh my God, look at what you did to him!&quot; </p>

<p>A spokesperson for the airline later stated that a passenger was taken off of Flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville because it was overbooked. Dao, who had been randomly selected, refused to comply. &quot;After our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate,&quot; they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111402/http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/04/10/video-shows-man-forcibly-removed-united-flight-chicago-louisville/100274374/?from=global&amp;sessionKey=&amp;autologin=">told the Courier-Journal</a>. </p>

<p>United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111402/https://twitter.com/united/status/851471781827420160/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fchicagoist.com%2F2017%2F04%2F10%2Fvideo_man_screams_as_he_is_forcibly.php">issued an apology statement</a> this week, pledging to conduct an internal review of policy and personally contact Dao. </p>

<p>Dao <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111402/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/04/port_authority_cops_wont_pull_passengers_off_overb.html#incart_2box_nj-homepage-featured">reportedly</a> lost two front teeth, and sustained a concussion during the incident.</p>

<p>&quot;There hasn&apos;t been an incident in memory here like the one in Chicago, but the Port Authority felt it important to reiterate the Port Authority&apos;s stand on the matter,&quot; a Port Authority spokesman told the NY Post. </p>
