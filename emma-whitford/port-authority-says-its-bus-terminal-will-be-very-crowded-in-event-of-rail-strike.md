<p>Negotiations are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720063026/http://abc7ny.com/traffic/nj-transit-unions-still-trying-to-reach-a-deal-as-strike-deadline-looms/1236311/">still underway</a> between NJ Transit and its rail worker unions over the workers&apos; demand for a 2.6% salary increase and better healthcare benefits, meaning a massive rail strike impacting about 100,000 commuters could still go into effect this Sunday at 12:01 a.m. NJ Transit has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720063026/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/nj_transit_offers_contingency_plan.php">already announced</a> that its contingency plan&#x2014;which relies on five temporary park-ride lots where commuters can take shuttles to the PATH train, commuter ferries, or straight into Manhattan&#x2014;will only accommodate about 40% of its customers. And today, the Port Authority has chimed in with a reminder that certain transit routes and hubs could approach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720063026/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/pls_send_more_l_train_headlines.php">L-train-level</a> congestion in time for next week&apos;s commute. </p>

<p>Specifically&#x2014;and of most import to New Yorkers who don&apos;t bother with New Jersey&#x2014;the strike would make it significantly more difficult to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720063026/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/26/bathroom_humor_air_quotes.php#photo-1">score a bathroom stall</a> at Port Authority or drag a suitcase to Newark Airport. </p>

<p>According to the Authority, commuters should expect &quot;significant delays and crowded conditions&quot; at Port Authority and adjacent bridges and tunnels during peak commuting hours&#x2014;6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., and 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. on weekdays. The PATH train will also be cross-honoring NJ Transit customers in the event of a strike, meaning all PATH entry points in NYC will be extra cozy. </p>

<p>And because the strike would impact the NJ Transit connector to Newark Airport at Newark-Penn Station&#x2014;there won&apos;t be any shuttle buses between the train station and the airport&#x2014;it&apos;s probably a better bet to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720063026/https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Penn+Station,+New+York,+NY/Newark+Liberty+International+Airport,+3+Brewster+Road,+Newark,+NJ+07114/@40.7305216,-74.1623407,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c259ae15b2adcb:0x7955420634fd7eba!2m2!1d-73.993519!2d40.750568!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c252e1c5ec0cef:0xb3f3b437c5d7f286!2m2!1d-74.1744624!2d40.6895314!3e3">take Amtrak from Penn Station</a>.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the announcement in full: </p>

<p><strong>Port Authority Bus Terminal/Tunnel and Bridge Crossings</strong><br>
Motorists and bus riders traveling to New York between 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and to New Jersey from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. should allow additional time and expect significant delays and crowded conditions. The Port Authority encourages anyone attempting to drive during a rail stoppage to carpool and travel at off-peak hours.<br>
 <br>
<strong>The Lincoln Tunnel Exclusive Bus Lane (XBL)</strong>, a contra-flow bus lane serving the Port Authority Bus Terminal, will be operational one hour earlier than normal, starting at 5 a.m., to ease typical morning traffic. It will remain in operation an hour later than normal, until 11 a.m.<br>
 <br>
<strong>PATH</strong><br>
Efforts will be made to maximize capacity during the peak weekday morning and evening hours on the Newark to World Trade Center, Journal Square to 33rd Street and the Hoboken to 33rd Street and Hoboken to World Trade Center lines. PATH will be cross-honoring NJ Transit rail passengers on its system.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Newark Liberty International Airport </strong><br>
There will be no NJ Transit service to the airport&#x2019;s rail link station, while Amtrak trains will continue service.  There will be no airport shuttle buses between Newark Penn Station and the airport, but customers can utilize existing NJ Transit buses and taxis and other ground transportation providers. AirTrain Newark will be in operation.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Ferry Service</strong><br>
The agency also urges commuters to consider ferries as an alternate means of travel. Commuters are encouraged to take advantage of ferry service near the Hoboken PATH station, given the expected passenger increases on PATH trains to New York. Service on the Hoboken to 33rd Street PATH line will remain unchanged.  For information on the ferry service, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720063026/http://www.panynj.gov/commuting-traveling/ferry-transportation.html">go here</a>. </p>

<p>The Port Authority will post all service updates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720063026/http://www.panynj.gov/">here</a>, moving into next week. </p>
