<p>An 18-year-old man was fatally shot in the head and another teenager was wounded during a broad daylight shooting that occurred soon after school dismissal at a busy East New York intersection yesterday.</p>

<p>Neither of the victims&apos; identities have been released by authorities. The NYPD confirmed that three suspects were in custody on Thursday morning, and that a weapon was recovered from the scene. </p>

<p>Officers responded to the corner of Livonia Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue at 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday. The intersection, which runs under elevated train tracks, is crowded with restaurants and convenience stores and abuts the campus of Achievement First East New York, a charter elementary school. </p>

<p>On the scene, police discovered an 18-year-old man with a gunshot wound to his head, and a 17-year-old man with a gunshot wound to his right arm. Both victims were transported to Brookdale Hospital, where the older teen was placed on life support and later died. The 17-year-old was listed in stable condition. </p>

<p>Friends gathered at the hospital <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000238/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/nyregion/teenager-killed-in-shooting-near-brooklyn-schools.html">told the NY Times</a> that the 18-year-old had recently graduated from the High School for Civil Rights, part of Thomas Jefferson Educational Campus a block north of where the shooting took place. </p>

<p>Surveillance video obtained by the paper shows a group of teenagers standing on the sidewalk on Pennsylvania near Livonia before shots ring out. The teen who was shot in the shoulder is seen stumbling into a nearby convenience store. </p>

<p>&quot;I heard one shot, I turned around and everybody just dispersed. Then I saw the boy lying down,&quot; Alexus Lapomarede, a sophomore at Jefferson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601000238/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/teen-fatally-shot-wounded-brooklyn-charter-article-1.2496076">told the News</a>. &quot;I was kind of in shock and my friend was pulling me to run back to the school.&quot;</p>

<p>The tabloid identified the victims as Darnell Wilkerson, 18, and John Trinidad, 17. </p>

<p>&quot;They&apos;re good friends,&quot; a friend of the victims and recent Jefferson graduate said. &quot;They were always sticking together.&quot;</p>
