Wyatt Tyler, who lived in the building, was pronounced dead on the scene. <p></p>

<p>Police responded to the sidewalk outside of 924 Metropolitan Avenue, near the corner of Olive Street, around 2:30 a.m. on Saturday. On arrival, they discovered Tyler unconscious and unresponsive on the sidewalk, with body trauma. EMS transported him to Woodhull Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>Tyler was attending a party in the apartment, according to multiple media reports. Tabloids <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330020828/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-21-dies-falling-fourth-floor-window-brooklyn-article-1.3008765">reported</a> that Tyler leaned against a screen in the fourth floor window that could not support his weight, though an NYPD spokesman would only confirm that he had fallen from a fourth-floor window. </p>

<p>The spokesman added that no criminality was suspected, though an investigation is ongoing. Tyler is believed to have been intoxicated when he fell, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>&quot;We heard a bunch of people running down the stairs and screaming and yelling,&quot; neighbor Lance Neyland, 27, t<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330020828/http://nypost.com/2017/03/25/drunk-man-falls-to-his-death-from-apartment-building/">old the NY Post</a>. &quot;At first I thought it was just people being drunk and I was going to go down there and tell them to quiet down, but then I looked out the window and I realized what had happened.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I just kept hearing [cursing] over and over again,&quot; neighbor Elizabeth Laraia, 28, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330020828/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-21-dies-falling-fourth-floor-window-brooklyn-article-1.3008765">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;I knew there was something going on with the amount of yelling, but thats really, really sad.&quot; </p>

<p>Wyatt grew up in New Orleans, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330020828/https://www.facebook.com/wyatt.d.tyler">his Facebook page</a>, and reportedly studied at NYU.  </p>

<p>Wyatt was the second person to fall to his death in Brooklyn this past weekend. Rame Pierre-Louis, 13, died after he jumped off of a Bushwick rooftop on Friday. He may have believed that police were chasing him when he took the fatal leap, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330020828/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/26/he_was_such_a_great_kid_friends_fam.php">according to reports</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Rame was a good kid from a loving home,&quot; a relative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330020828/http://nypost.com/2017/03/25/roof-jumping-teens-devastated-friends-its-hard-to-believe/">told the NY Post</a>. &quot;For him to end like this is devastating to his whole family. It&#x2019;s unbelievable.&quot;</p>
