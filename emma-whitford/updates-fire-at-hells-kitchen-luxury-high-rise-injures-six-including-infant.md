<p>Flames broke out at 6:37 a.m., in a storage room on the second floor of the north tower at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132211/https://www.silvertowers.com/new-york-apartments">Silver Towers</a>, a luxury complex at 610 West 42nd Street. Smoke filled the entire building, according to the FDNY, waking residents asleep in their apartments. </p>

<p>&quot;Building management immediately alerted residents via the building notification system and called the FDNY,&quot; a spokesperson for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132211/https://www.silversteinproperties.com/">Silverstein Properties</a>, which owns the towers, stated. </p>

<p>But some residents say they didn&apos;t hear a fire alarm. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s crazy. I didn&apos;t even hear any alarm,&quot; one resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132211/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/blaze-midtown-high-rise-leaves-injured-article-1.2702389">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;I got woken up by banging on my door at 6:45 a.m.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I had no idea what was going on,&quot; he added. &#x201C;The hallway was completely full of smoke.... the alarms were going off in the hallway, but not in the apartment.&quot; </p>

<p>Other residents said their only notice of the fire was a brief e-mail message from  management, sent nearly an hour after the fire department responded. </p>

<p>One current resident shared said e-mail with Gothamist. With the subject line &quot;Fire Incident,&quot; the notice is time-stamped 7:20 a.m. It reads in full, &quot;There is a fire incident in the north tower, the FDNY is on site and the elevators are down.&quot; </p>

<p>Robin Hamilton, 59, says she was inside the elevator on the 22nd floor when the electricity went out, trapping her inside with another resident. &quot;I kept pushing the buttons and I started pushing the alarm buttons, and no one came,&quot; she told us on Thursday. &quot;It was so hot in there. A gentleman pried the door open, and we walked out. We didn&apos;t know there was a fire, and then I saw the smoke.&quot; </p>

<p>The Silverstein spokesperson described the fire as &quot;small,&quot; and stressed that it broke out in an unoccupied area. The first eight floors of the 60-story building were evacuated &quot;as a precautionary measure,&quot; according to the spokesperson, although residents living above the eighth floor told us they evacuated as well. </p>

<p>Silverstein declined to comment on the status of fire alarms in the building. </p>

An eight-week-old infant was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132211/http://abc7ny.com/1416852/">reportedly hospitalized</a> as a precaution. </p>

<p>&quot;The smoke was light gray. Trying to breathe, you could feel it,&quot; one tenant told DNAInfo. &quot;We didn&apos;t mess around. We got out as fast as we could.&quot; </p>

<p>About 140 firefighters responded to the scene, and spent several hours subduing the flames. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132211/http://abc7ny.com/1416852/">According to ABC</a>, four residents were evacuated from their fourth floor apartment window via ladder. </p>

<p>According to Silverstein, all residents regained access to their apartments on Thursday afternoon, although power had yet to be restored. But several residents said Thursday that while their apartments were technically accessible, the lack of elevators and lingering smoke smell deterred them. </p>

<p>Instead, they spent the night at another Silverstein building across the street. </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 7/8]</strong>: This piece has been updated throughout with comments from building residents. Silverstein Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the elevators, or the e-mail notification regarding yesterday&apos;s fire. </p>
