<p>Newly acquired surveillance footage contradicts an NYPD undercover officer&apos;s claim that four people tried to mug him at knifepoint outside of a Flatbush hardware store. </p>

<p>Four friends facing charges as a result of the alleged incident say they entered the hardware store at 1787 Nostrand Avenue on the afternoon of December 26th to cut keys, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113130203/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/video-contradicts-claims-men-robbed-brooklyn-article-1.2494825">first reported by the Daily News</a>. </p>

<p>An attorney for Peterson Duplan, 28, tells the News that her client recognized the man who approached him inside the hardware store as Winston McDonald, an undercover detective who had arrested him years ago. McDonald allegedly asked Duplan if he could buy some drugs, to which Duplan allegedly responded &quot;get the fuck out of here.&quot; </p>

<p>Detective McDonald testified in Brooklyn Criminal court that he was the victim of attempted robbery that day. According to court papers, Duplan flashed a switchblade at McDonald outside of the hardware store, and said &quot;give me your money or I will stab you.&quot; Duplan allegedly approached the undercover with his three companions&#x2014;Jean Scott, 33; Ricardi Joseph, 29; and Samanta Dabel, 24&#x2014;all of whom surrounded McDonald and allegedly threatened that, in substance, &quot;We are going to fuck you up.&quot; </p>

<p>However, surveillance footage from inside and outside of the hardware store acquired by the News contradicts McDonald&apos;s claims. Indoor footage shows Duplan, in blue, speaking with Detective Winston, who appears to be displaying cash. At one point, Duplan pushes McDonald away. He and the others exit the shop. </p>

<p>Outside, Duplan and the others can be seen walking away from the shop (the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office and NYPD confirmed that the incident allegedly took place in front of the hardware store). Detective McDonald steps onto the sidewalk close behind the group, and follows them out of view. </p>

<p>All four suspects were arrested at 2 pm and charged with resisting arrest, as well as menacing, obstructing governmental administration, and robbery, according to the NYPD. Joseph was slapped with an additional criminal sale of marijuana charge. </p>

<p>According to McDonald&apos;s account, a group of about 30 bystanders gathered while he facilitated the arrest. No such scene was captured on surveillance footage outside of the hardware store listed in the criminal complaint, according to the News (footage included in the above video is edited). </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the NYPD confirmed that no blade was recovered from the scene. The department could not immediately confirm if an internal investigation into the arrest is underway. </p>

<p>&quot;The Detective&apos;s statements of facts are directly contradicted by the videotape. In light of this, justice can only be served, in this instance, by an immediate dismissal of all of the charges for all of the defendants,&quot; said Duplan&apos;s attorney in a statement. </p>
