<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425225236/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/half_price_metrocards_nyc.php">last spring</a>, transit advocates have urged Mayor de Blasio to fund a half-price MetroCard program for New York City&apos;s working poor&#x2014;about 800,000 New Yorkers, excluding seniors and the disabled, who live at or below the federal poverty threshold. A joint study [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425225236/http://b.3cdn.net/nycss/7169ea001b71493ce9_lvm6b2ptw.pdf">PDF</a>] released in conjunction with the campaign found that more than a quarter of low-income, working New Yorkers were unable to afford subway or bus fare at least once in 2015, impacting trips to work and school. For non-citizen New Yorkers, fare beating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425225236/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/25/nypd_turnstile_jumping_deportation.php">increases the risk of exposure</a> to federal immigration authorities. </p>

<p>&quot;Because the MTA is cash-strapped, we&apos;re saying that it makes sense for the program to be run by the city,&quot; Rebecca Bailin of the Riders Alliance told us last spring. </p>

<p>The NYPD arrested 2,000 people for turnstile jumping in January&#x2014;a 17.5 percent decrease over the previous year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425225236/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170223/financial-district/2000-people-were-arrested-for-turnstile-jumping-january-nypd">According to the department</a>, summonses far outstripped arrests for the same offense: 5,502 that month. &quot;People do not jump turnstiles for fun,&quot; says Bailin.</p>

<p>But the Mayor&apos;s Office has consistently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425225236/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/metrocard_reduced_fare.php">dismissed the half priced MetroCard initiative</a>, estimated to cost about $250 million, as cost prohibitive. Now, transit advocates and veto-proof majority of City Council members are pushing for a compromise: fund the program in phases, starting with half-price MetroCards for New Yorkers in &quot;deep poverty&quot; who make fifty percent of the federal poverty level or less: $10,000 annually for a family of three, $12,000 annually for a family of four. </p>

<p>Phase one of the program would cost an estimated $50 million in the FY 2018 budget, advocates estimate. About 379,000 New Yorkers would qualify. A second phase would accommodate up to 75 percent of the federal poverty level, ahead of full implementation. </p>

<p>Bailin compared the proposal to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425225236/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/29/fight_for_15_first_phase_of_minimum.php">$15 minimum wage timeline</a>: a gradual implementation over several years. &quot;It both allows the city to work out kinks in the program, and figure out any budget issues,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>The City Council suggested $50 million for a half-fare pilot in a response to the mayor&apos;s FY 2018 budget draft, according to a spokesperson for Manhattan Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez, who heads up the transportation committee. The spokesman added that if de Blasio is willing to negotiate on this, the City Council will push for the money to be earmarked specifically for phase one. &quot;We don&apos;t want it to be a pilot program, because those can be canceled and ended quickly,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>According to Rodriguez&apos;s office, the half-fare program would be part of budget negotiations planned for the next month and a half, while the FY 2018 budget is finalized. </p>

<p>A 2015 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425225236/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/upshot/transportation-emerges-as-crucial-to-escaping-poverty.html?_r=0">Harvard University study</a> found transportation access to be a major factor in escaping poverty. Mayor de Blasio has acknowledged this in the past, proposing the Brooklyn Queens Connector as a way to connect New Yorkers to more job opportunities along the waterfront. </p>

<p>&quot;It is clear that access to transportation is one of, if not the most, determinative factor when it comes to low-income families escaping poverty,&quot; Council Member Rodriguez said in a statement. &quot;We have a prime opportunity to support those most in need and we shouldn&apos;t let it pass us by.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayoral spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein told Gothamist Tuesday that the mayor&apos;s position on the fair fares campaign has not changed. </p>

<p>&quot;The proposal is a noble one but the mayor has been very clear: the MTA is the responsibility of the state and they should consider funding the program,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>The MTA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but spokeswoman Beth DeFalco told us last fall that the MTA &quot;already makes a substantial commitment to low-income City riders,&quot; and would not fund the program. </p>

<p>Transit advocates and elected officials are rallying for the phase-in outside City Hall this afternoon. </p>
