<p>The driver of a black minivan ran a red light and struck a 6-year-old boy walking with his father in a Brooklyn crosswalk on Wednesday afternoon, according to a preliminary NYPD investigation and surveillance footage from the scene. Police said Thursday that the driver fled the scene, and that the vehicle had TLC plates. The boy is expected to survive. </p>

<p>Surveillance video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093446/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Child-Run-Over-Minivan-Hit-Run-Brooklyn-391219441.html">acquired by NBC</a> shows the driver striking the child moments after he and his father step off of the curb at the northwest corner of 41st Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway in Borough Park. The father then picks up the child and rushes to the far side of the street. Afterwards, the driver exits his Toyota Sienna and walks around the exterior, apparently checking for damage, before driving away. </p>

<p>Police responded to the scene shortly after 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the department. He said that the boy&apos;s 41-year-old father filed a complaint, corroborated with witness accounts. &quot;Preliminarily, this minivan may have gone through a steady red light,&quot; the spokesman added. </p>

<p>The victim, whose name has not been released, was transported to Maimonides Medical Center in stable condition, with an injured hip. </p>

<p>According to the surveillance video, the boy and his father were not immediately next to the vehicle when the driver exited to inspect it. The footage does not capture any interaction between suspect and victim. </p>

<p>&quot;You have to know you hit the person,&quot; Britt Arguetta, a local business owner who captured the crash on her surveillance camera, told NBC. &quot;You&apos;re driving. The child is in front of you.&quot; </p>

<p>No arrests have been made as of Thursday morning. The TLC deferred comment to the NYPD. <br>
