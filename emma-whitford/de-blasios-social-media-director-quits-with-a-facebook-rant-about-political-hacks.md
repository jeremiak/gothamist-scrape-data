<p>Mayor de Blasio&apos;s newly-hired social media director took to Facebook to announce he had quit on Tuesday, just two months after his May start date. Scott Kleinberg, who came to the mayor&apos;s office from a social media gig at The Chicago Tribune, commented bluntly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160629/civic-center/de-blasio-social-media-director-quits-after-2-months-working-with-hacks">on his Facebook wall</a> that, &quot;I ended up with political hacks plus a boss who just couldn&apos;t get it.&quot;</p>

<p>Kleinberg&apos;s use of the word &apos;hacks&apos; elicited considerable social media attention this week, as the 43-year-old was hired to work for a Mayor who this spring became the subject of a handful of investigations into his fundraising tactics, led by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in conjunction with the FBI, as well as Comptroller Scott Stringer&apos;s office and the State Attorney General&apos;s office. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://www.nydailynews.com/amp/news/politics/de-blasio-social-media-director-quits-slams-office-article-1.2693215">The Daily News notes</a> that Kleinberg&apos;s direct boss was Rob Bennett, head of creative communications.</p>

<p>Kleinberg, 43, was hired to &quot;infuse personality and engagement&quot; into Mayor de Blasio&apos;s social media channels, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/422-16/mayor-de-blasio-changes-his-communications-lineup">press release dated May 3rd</a>. Sources told the Daily News that he arrived at City Hall with a set of pillows monogrammed with the logos for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, that was fast,&quot; Kleinberg wrote in his public post (since deleted, but captured by the News). &quot;I moved to NYC for a dream job and that&apos;s not what I got. I tried to stick it out, but it was impossible. I don&apos;t even know the word quit, but for the sake of my health and my sanity, I decided I needed to do just that.&quot; </p>

<p>Kleinberg went on to ask for job leads in New York, touting his skills as a social media manager, director, consultant, and columnist&#x2014;arguably not the most impressive display of social media savvy or prudence. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/De-Blasio-Staffer-Quits-Blasts-Administrations-Political-Hacks-384927951.html">statement from City Hall</a> following Kleinberg&apos;s departure was short on sympathies. &quot;New York City government is a tough, fast-paced job that is not for everyone,&quot; a mayoral spokesperson said. &quot;We wish him well.&quot;</p>

<p>The dramatic exit comes on the heels of former-press secretary Karen Hinton&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/06/hinton_resigning_de_blasio.php">departure from City Hall</a>, after about a year on the job. Hinton exited with less of a bang: The Mayor praised her hard work in a statement, and insiders assured that her decision had nothing to do with her increasingly turbulent work environment. </p>

<p>Also this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/nyregion/mayor-de-blasios-counsel-to-leave-next-month-to-lead-police-review-board.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">the NY Times reports</a> that Maya Wiley, Mayor de Blasio&apos;s chief legal advisor, will resign in July for a post as chairwoman of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/html/home/home.shtml">Civil Complaint Review Board</a>, an independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct. </p>

<p>An anonymous source &quot;familiar with her thinking&quot; told the paper that Wiley felt left out of the Mayor&apos;s inner circle. One of her final tasks as legal advisor was to pull together a response to investigators&apos; requests for documents, including e-mails between the mayor and advisors outside City Hall. </p>

<p>It was Wiley who first described said advisors as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/nyregion/de-blasio-pressed-to-clarify-new-adviser-role-agent-of-the-city.html?_r=0">agents of the city</a>,&quot; an eyebrow-raising designation that protected their e-mails from scrutiny, seemingly, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111553/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/20/power_corrupts_park_slopers_absolutely.php">because</a>. </p>
