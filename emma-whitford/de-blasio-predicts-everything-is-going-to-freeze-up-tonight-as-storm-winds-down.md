<p>Updating the public on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717214932/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/14/great_blizzard_not.php#photo-1">March 2017 Blizzard That Wasn&apos;t</a> this afternoon, Mayor de Blasio urged New Yorkers to continue observing a state of emergency in effect until midnight.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, we are not the weather experts,&quot; de Blasio told reporters when asked if the city might have over-prepared for a storm that fell far short of blizzard predictions. &quot;I just want to say this very simple: The National Weather Service is the best we got.&quot; </p>

<p>The mayor also stood by his decision to close schools today, citing double-digit precipitation forecasts into late Monday night. &quot;To me it was a real straightforward decision,&quot; he said. Public schools will open tomorrow. </p>

<p>The most significant precipitation is expected to drop off this afternoon in NYC, though a winter weather advisory will remain in effect until 8:00 p.m., the mayor said, with slush transitioning to rain and then back to snow before storm&apos;s end. A wind advisory is also in effect until 6:00 p.m., with gusts up to 50 miles per hour in the city. The state of emergency anticipates icy conditions, as the slushy temperatures are expected to drop down into the 20s this afternoon and into tonight. </p>

<p>&quot;You&apos;re going to see a lot of refreezing, and that means the conditions on the roads and sidewalks are going to be very dangerous as we get into the afternoon and evening hours,&quot; the mayor said. &quot;Everything is going to freeze up.&quot; </p>

<p>MTA underground service is running this afternoon, albeit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717214932/http://alert.mta.info/">with delays</a>. Above-ground service is still suspended however, as is all express subway service. According to Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg, the MTA saw about 10 percent of its typical weekday ridership this morning. </p>

<p>NYC buses are running at reduced levels&#x2014;the mayor said they appear to be &quot;running pretty well&quot; this afternoon&#x2014;and Metro-North service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717214932/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/14/metronorth_snowstorm_stella.php">is suspended</a>. The Long Island Railroad is running on a normal schedule, though delays are expected.</p>

<p>The Department of Sanitation said that 87 percent of streets had been salted, and 96 percent plowed at least once, as of noon. Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia said that her crews will focus on de-icing over night, and will prioritize clearing school sidewalks and bike lanes for the Wednesday commute.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to be over-confident,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;Stay off the roads.&quot; </p>

<p>You can file a complaint about a snowy or icy roadway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717214932/http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2808/snow-or-ice-on-roadway-removal">here</a>. </p>
