title: NYPD Officer Stomped On Man's Head "Like A Roach," Says Prosecutor
---

	
										<p>The trial for an NYPD officer accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/26/cop_stripped_of_gun_after_allegedly.php">stomping on a man&apos;s head</a> during a 2014 arrest in Bedford-Stuyvesant began on Tuesday, with the prosecution comparing the officer&apos;s actions to a person indifferently squashing a bug. Officer Joel Edouard&apos;s arrest tactic was like a &quot;stomp on a roach that you intend to kill,&#x201D; prosecutor Marc Fliedner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-stomped-man-head-roach-prosecutor-article-1.2615267">said</a>. </p>

<p>Officer Edouard, 38, allegedly approached 32-year-old Jahmiel Cuffee after he spotted him rolling a joint on a Bed-Stuy street on July 23rd, 2014. Cuffee reportedly showed his ID to Edouard and several other officers, then struggled with them while they attempted to arrest him; the officers wrestled him to the ground before Edouard drew his gun and started stomping on Cuffee&apos;s head. </p>

<p>Edouard was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-desk-duty-reportedly-stomping-man-article-1.1880818">assigned to desk duty</a> in July 2014, after video of the violent arrest surfaced on YouTube. </p>

<p>Edouard was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/03/cop_head_stomp_arrest.php">initially charged</a> with assault, attempted assault, and official misconduct. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun&#x2014;who recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/nypd_cop_sentencing_gurley.php">dropped manslaughter charges</a> against an NYPD officer convicted of killing an innocent man in a Brooklyn stairwell&#x2014;dropped Edouard&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/misconduct-charges-dropped-nypd-cops-accused-assaults-article-1.2245088">official misconduct charge</a> last summer. </p>

<p>Cuffee, who was arrested a few days after Eric Garner was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">choked to death</a> by a police officer on Staten Island, sustained bumps and scrapes. He was initially charged with attempted tampering with evidence, obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest&#x2014;all of which were ultimately dismissed. </p>

<p>The defense countered on Tuesday that Cuffee had resisted arrest, and appeared to be reaching for a gun at the small of his back. &quot;Some think they have a right to drink and smoke weed in public and resist arrest,&quot; the defense <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/26/officer-joel-edouard-trial/">said</a>. &quot;A civilian is not entitled to resist arrest.&quot;</p>

<p>Gary Dormer, who took the video of Cuffee&apos;s arrest, testified on Tuesday that he saw Edouard point his gun at Cuffee&apos;s face, only to put it down when he &quot;looked me directly in my eyes.&quot; Dormer also said that he saw Cuffee and another man pass something between them before the cops approached, and that he only saw Cuffee&apos;s head hit the ground once. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, two NYPD officers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/two_nypd_detectives_charged_with_as.php">charged with assault</a> in connection with the 2015 beating of a postal worker in Queens. The victim, who says he&apos;s been targeted by the NYPD since he unwittingly gave directions to a cop killer, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917132817/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/21/postal-worker-nypd-lawsuit/">since filed a $100 million lawsuit</a> against the city. <br>
