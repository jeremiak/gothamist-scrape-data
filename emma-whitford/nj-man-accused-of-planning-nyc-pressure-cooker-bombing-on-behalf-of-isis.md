<p>A 20-year-old New Jersey man was planning to plant a pressure cooker bomb in Manhattan on behalf of ISIS and &quot;kill as many people as possible&quot; when State police arrested him for attempting to kill his family dog earlier this year, according to a criminal complaint released Friday. </p>

<p>Gregory Lepsky was arrested in late February, and a subsequent search of his home prompted a more in-depth FBI investigation into alleged terrorist activities. </p>

<p>Lepsky, of Point Pleasant, NJ, was charged Friday with attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. The charge has a maximum sentence of 20 years and a $250,000 fine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506184638/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/05/05/nj-man-isis-pressure-cooker-bomb-plot-nyc/">according to CBS</a>.</p>

<p>State police caught wind of Lepsky on February 21st, when they received a call that he allegedly &quot;possessed a weapon&quot; and was planning to kill his family&apos;s dog at his Point Pleasant home. When police arrived at the scene, Lepsky exited the house, his arm bleeding. He was taken into custody and treated. </p>

<p>According to a criminal complaint published by CBS [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506184638/https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/web-extra-full-complaint-against-gregory-lepsky.pdf">PDF</a>], &quot;Lepsky stated that he was going to kill his mother and that he had pledged his allegiance to &apos;Allah.&apos;&quot; He then admitted to stabbing the dog because, &quot;in Lepsky&apos;s view of Islam, the dog was dirty,&quot; and said that he had joined ISIS and had plane tickets to Turkey. (The dog sustained a &quot;large slash wound&quot; but survived.) </p>

<p>In Lepsky&apos;s bedroom closet, according to the complaint, police found an empty steel pressure cooker behind a roll of bubble wrap. Books in Lepsky&apos;s bedroom included one titled <em>Martyrdom in Jihad versus Suicide Bombing</em>. Later, at the hospital, Lepsky allegedly said that his name was Allah Abdel Rochmad, and that he had been communicating with ISIS through Facebook. From the complaint: </p>

<blockquote>Lepsky said that he was going to take a pressure cooker, use it to make a bomb, and place it in a busy area in New York City in order to kill as many people as possible. Lepsky also said that he was looking forward to more bombs and explosions happening very soon.</blockquote>

<p>Following Lepsky&apos;s arrest, police interviewed family members who said they&apos;d noticed changes in his behavior starting last December. For example, he&apos;d started talking about how the Muslim faith does not tolerate &quot;gays.&quot; The FBI obtained a court order to search Lepsky&apos;s Facebook, recovering posts like &quot;I want to be different I want to be religious and grow up and be a martyr,&quot; according to the complaint. Investigators said they also found numerous ISIS and beheading-related searches in his internet history. </p>
