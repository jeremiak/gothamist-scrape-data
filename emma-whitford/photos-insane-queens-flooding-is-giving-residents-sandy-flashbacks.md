					<p>Many narrow residential streets east and west of Cross Bay Boulevard in Broad Channel, Queens were shin-deep in steadily-rising cold Jamaica Bay floodwaters shortly before the 8:52 p.m. high tide on Monday night&#x2014;more than 12 hours after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/flooding_nyc_high_tides.php">coastal storm grazed the Rockaways</a>, churning salt water between one and three feet deep on some roadways. </p>

<p>&quot;It hasn&apos;t been this bad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/29/remembering_hurricane_sandy_28_unbe.php#photo-1">since Sandy</a>,&quot; said Steve Kenny, a carpenter who&apos;s lived on East Sixth Road in Broad Channel since 1999, as he surveyed the rising tide on his impassable street on Monday night. </p>

<p>Ankle-deep pools spanned the width of East Sixth and the length of two blocks, reflecting street lights. Between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m., water levels rose about an inch and a half, spilling from back yards adjacent to Jamaica Bay. Sidewalks a reporter had previously perched on to keep dry were submerged. </p>

<p>The National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory for the south shore of Queens for 7:00 a.m. on Monday&#x2014;a less-severe notification than the flood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/https://twitter.com/NotifyNYC/status/696708413561180160">warning</a> issued for coastal neighborhoods in the Bronx. But Queens was ultimately hit the hardest, as storm winds drove new moon tidewaters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/08/queens-flooding-winter-storm/">submerging cars and flooding basements</a> in Broad Channel, Howard Beach and the Rockaways. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www.wnyc.org/story/flooding-no-one-saw-coming/">told WNYC on Monday</a> that in Queens, &quot;We found out, obviously, as [the flooding] was happening. It was not expected from the original reports.&quot;</p>

<p>After the 2012 hurricane, Kenny said he raised his house seven feet on a new concrete foundation. He indicated the water line on his house from Monday&apos;s flooding, about 14 inches above the sidewalk. &quot;Usually we&apos;re prepared, but we had no clue,&quot; he said. &quot;It was up to the rims of my wife&apos;s car.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Mayor, coastal Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/new-york-ny/10007/weather-warnings/349727">expect similar flooding</a> during the morning and evening high tide cycles on Tuesday and Wednesday. Tides are expected to rise 2 to 2.5 feet above normal levels, causing flooding of roads and properties. </p>

<p>&quot;It was shin-high on my block today,&quot; said Seventh Road resident Dan Allen on Monday night, taking a cell-phone video of the rushing tide on East Sixth. &quot;Luckily, my car got off the block. Good neighbors let each other know.&quot; He then quickly excused himself, pointing out that soon he wouldn&apos;t be able to walk around the block to his home without drenching his feet.</p>

<p><iframe frameborder="0" width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20160821064245if_/http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x3r5lyo" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3r5lyo_flooding-on-east-6th-road-in-broad-channel-7-45-p-m-monday_news" target="_blank"></a> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www.dailymotion.com/Gothamist" target="_blank"></a></i></p>

<p>&quot;It came out of nowhere,&quot; echoed Sean O&apos;Neill on nearby West 12th Road&#x2014;one of eight residential side streets in Broad Channel that finger out into the bay. His street is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/nyregion/debate-over-cost-and-practicality-of-protecting-part-of-queens-coast.html?_r=0">among the lowest-lying areas in NYC</a>, and one of the worst hit in the neighborhood this week. More than a dozen cars parked on the street were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://w12thrd.blogspot.com/2016/02/coastal-flooding-catches-parked-cars.html">nearly submerged</a> at 7:00 a.m. </p>

<p>&quot;All we heard Sunday night was snow,&quot; O&apos;Neill added. &quot;Everyone was watching the Super Bowl so we slept in today, and all of a sudden you see people screaming and yelling. My wife almost fell down while she was running to the door because she thought it was going to come into the house.&quot; </p>

<p>A few cars could be seen partially submerged on West 12th on Monday night, awaiting tow-trucks. &quot;The lights came on, the siren came on, it smoked, and it was done,&quot; said Richie, a resident of West 12th for five decades, pointing at one vehicle. Stooping, he pulled on knee-high boots to slosh to his home, mid-block. &quot;I went out with the waders on this morning and it was up to here,&quot; he said, raising his palm to his waist. &quot;Down the end of the block, it was chest deep.&quot; </p>

<p>Tidal flooding is common in Broad Channel, a low-lying island community that the City has dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/resilient-neighborhoods/old-howard-beach-hamilton-beach-broad-channel.page">particularly vulnerable</a> to climate change. The City&apos;s flood-prevention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/22/by_2030_de_blasio_wants_to_reduce_n.php">efforts</a> include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www.enr.com/articles/11832-queens-road-project-takes-the-unconventional-path">fortifying</a> West 11th, 12th, and 13th roads with bulkheads and a new drainage system&#x2014;a slow process due in part to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/nyregion/debate-over-cost-and-practicality-of-protecting-part-of-queens-coast.html?_r=0">funding issues</a> and complicated inter-agency coordination efforts. According to the City, the work will be done by June 2017. &quot;This town is usually flooded three or four times a month,&quot; O&apos;Neill said. &quot;You just get used to it.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, Monday&apos;s flooding was an exception, reaching some of the higher-elevated parts of town. &quot;I know a couple houses on [Broad Channel] Boulevard got water in their yards, and that&apos;s insane,&quot; said a resident who goes by Gigi, on-shift Monday night at All American Channel Market a few blocks from West 12th Road. Around the corner, water was creeping up West 10th Road from the bay. &quot;People are saying it reminds them of Sandy,&quot; she said. &quot;This one customer had to have his daughter come meet him on the corner with boots this morning.&quot;  </p>

<p>Shortly before 9:00 p.m., O&apos;Neill picked his way up the block, a pair of rain boots in hand for his son, Michael, who had just been dropped off from football practice at the higher-elevated end of the street. O&apos;Neill has lived in the neighborhood for 40 years. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything like Sandy,&quot; he said. &quot;But now we&apos;ve seen what can happen. You&apos;re always scared of losing what you have again.&quot; </p>

<p>In anticipation of more flooding this morning, Mayor de Blasio has advised impacted residents to keep sandbags on hand, and pack for possible evacuations. Department of Environmental Protection crews will be deployed through Wednesday to clear catch basins in flood-prone neighborhoods. The City is broadcasting emergency alerts and updates via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821064245/https://a858-nycnotify.nyc.gov/notifynyc/">Notify NYC</a>.</p>

<p>The City said on Tuesday that Monday&apos;s flooding in Broad Channel did not result in home damage, and that no catch basin issues had been reported. </p>

<p>&quot;Parts of the City saw higher than normal water levels, resulting in coastal flooding,&quot; said Mayoral spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. &quot;The Office of Emergency Management immediately deployed City resources to the area.&quot;</p>
