<p>The NYC Department of Homeless Services said in a statement late Monday afternoon that it has tabled a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/13/photos_maspeth_residents_protest_pr.php#photo-1">plan</a> to convert a Holiday Inn Express in Maspeth, Queens into a new 110-bed homeless shelter for families with adult children. Instead, a spokeswoman said, DHS will rent out 30 rooms in the hotel, located at 59-40 55th Road, to house homeless employed men. The city began moving men into the hotel today. It would not confirm how long they will reside there. </p>

<p>&quot;Due to local opposition to housing homeless New Yorkers, we have not been able to convert this site into a full shelter at this time,&quot; said DHS spokeswoman Lauren Gray. &quot;We are renting rooms for employed single adults and providing onsite services and security.&quot;</p>

<p>The shelter was presented to the community in August, prompting near-nightly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-family-homeless-shelter-opening-postponed-article-1.2782296">protests</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/27/maspeth_shelter_protest.php#photo-1">threatened lawsuit from locals</a> and an actual lawsuit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/08/queens-councilwoman-sues-de-blasio-after-homeless-shelter-plan-105113">filed by elected officials</a>. Last month, hundreds of Maspeth residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/01/maspeth_homeless_shelter.php">turned their backs</a> on DHS Commissioner Steven Banks at the second of two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/12/maspeth_shelter_debate.php">raucous public hearings</a> on the shelter, which they have claimed would impact their safety and quality of life.</p>

<p>&quot;Commissioner, you have a legal and moral obligation to the taxpayers,&quot; said Maspeth resident Manuel Caruana at one of the meetings. &quot;Not to the homeless.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It will destroy this neighborhood, as these shelters have destroyed every community they&apos;ve been built in,&quot; added one 72-year-old Maspeth resident. &quot;It&apos;s prostitution followed by drugs followed by stealing, break-ins, [and] car break-ins. It&apos;s just a way of life.&quot; </p>

<p>DHS has argued that it needs to distribute shelters across that city, and that contrary to residents&#x2019; claims, homeless New Yorkers aren&#x2019;t simply outsiders&#x2014;there are 243 homeless New Yorkers whose last listed address was in Maspeth. Homelessness in New York City as a whole just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/30/homeless_in_nyc_hits_new_record_hig.php">hit a record high</a>. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio&apos;s office has also made the case in recent months that creating a new shelter in place of a hotel, rather than renting out some of the hotel rooms on a short-term basis, would help meet the administration&apos;s goal of phasing out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/homeless_cluster_site.php">cluster site housing</a> and other temporary shelter beds. </p>

<p>Last fall, following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/hotel_stabbing_ramada_homeless.php">triple stabbing murder</a> of a mother and two of her three small children in a Staten Island motel serving homeless families, Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/staten_island_homeless_stabbing.php">pledged</a> to phase out the practice of renting out hotel rooms as temporary shelter for the homeless &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This administration has committed to housing homeless New Yorkers and diminishing reliance on hotels and cluster spaces,&quot; mayoral spokeswoman Aja Worthy-Davis said over the summer. </p>

<p>The new plan to place 30 homeless men at the Holiday Inn Express conflicts with the administration&apos;s earlier stated objective. Worthy-Davis declined comment on Monday. </p>

<p>Robert Holden, president of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://www.junipercivic.com/">Juniper Park Civic Association</a> in Maspeth, has spearheaded many of the shelter protests, and said Monday that he had no doubt that the city would still try to move forward with a full shelter at the Holiday Inn Express site.  </p>

<p>&quot;We heard the news this morning,&quot; he said. &quot;They were doing it yesterday [moving men into the hotel], we heard. For the city to say, &apos;because of community opposition&apos; is ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>Some locals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/https://www.facebook.com/groups/65632017329/permalink/10153748412887330/">posting to a public Facebook group called Maspeth 11378</a> said they saw the city moving individuals into the hotel this afternoon. </p>

<p>&quot;This is the transparent administration that de Blasio talks about,&quot; Holden added. &quot;It&apos;s a holiday [Columbus Day] they are doing it on. But we are going to fight. We knew they would try this.&quot; </p>

<p>Holden is expecting a larger turnout than usual at tonight&apos;s protest outside the hotel, which will start around 7:00 p.m. His group raised $13,500 over the weekend, he said, and will use it to charter buses in the coming weeks&#x2014;to protest at Gracie Mansion and the home of hotel owner Harshad Patel, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620123412/http://pix11.com/2016/09/09/plans-for-holiday-inn-homeless-shelter-in-maspeth-queens-scrapped/">told Pix11 last month</a> that he had &quot;decided not to go against the community&quot; by opening a shelter. </p>

<p>&quot;It will be a shelter,&quot; Holden said. &quot;So when they <em>do</em> make it a full blown shelter, we&apos;ll do what we said we were going to do: we&apos;ll bring out a thousand people.&quot; </p>
