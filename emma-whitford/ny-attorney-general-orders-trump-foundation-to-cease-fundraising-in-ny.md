<p>The Trump Foundation, a charitable organization that Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump has used in the last year to solicit donations, has been operating illegally without proper Charities Bureau registration, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/http://ag.ny.gov/press-release/new-york-attorney-generals-office-issues-notice-violation-directing-trump-foundation">according to</a> New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman&apos;s office. </p>

<p>Trump&apos;s campaign has agreed to immediately stop soliciting donations in New York State, following its receipt of a cease-and-desist letter from Schneiderman&apos;s office, mailed Friday and made public Monday morning.</p>

<p>The foundation &#x201C;is in violation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/libdev/excerpts/exc172.htm">section 172 of Article 7-A New York&apos;s Executive Law</a>, which requires charitable organizations that solicit contributions in New York State to register with the Charities Bureau and to provide annual financial reports and annual audited financial statements,&quot; according to the AG&apos;s office. </p>

<p>Under New York State law, charities that take in more than $25,000 per year from the public must complete such a registration. Tax filings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html?0p19G=c">reviewed by the Washington Post</a> show that the Trump Foundation raised more than $25,000 from the public in each of the last ten years. </p>

<p>The outlet noted that it&apos;s not possible to determine from public documents whether all of these donations where solicitations under state law, adding that the technical definition of &quot;solicitation&quot; is broad. &quot;The only thing it wouldn&#x2019;t cover is somebody giving money without being asked,&#x201D; Pamela Mann, a former head of the New York State charities bureau, told the Post. </p>

<p>Some of the solicitations may have been made outside of New York, and would not, therefore, be in violation of state law. </p>

<p>Reporters have been probing Trump&apos;s charitable donations&#x2014;or lack thereof&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/us/politics/donald-trump-charity.html">for</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-but-gave-little-to-his-ow?utm_term=.xwZz7b9bYe#.omm49XPXml">months</a>, and skepticism about the Trump Foundation has been building. The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/us/politics/trump-foundation-charity-veterans.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fpeter-eavis&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection">recently reported</a> that the Trump Foundation doesn&apos;t show up on charity registers in multiple states, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html?0p19G=c">the Washington Post reported</a> that the foundation had not acquired proper certification in New York, one day before Schneiderman announced his investigation. </p>

<p>The notice from Schneiderman&apos;s office [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/trump_foundation_notice_of_violation_9-30-16.pdf">PDF</a>] orders the Trump Foundation to &quot;immediately cease soliciting contributions or engaging in other fundraising activities in New York,&quot; and to hand over all of the paperwork required as part of a typical Charities Bureau application, including annual financial reports and audited financial statements, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105546/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">according to the NY Times</a>. </p>

<p>The Washington Post points out that the application is intended, in part, to make sure that the foundation doesn&apos;t spend any of its money &quot;for the personal benefit of its officers.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;While we remain very concerned about the political motives behind A.G. Schneiderman&#x2019;s investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation,&quot; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks stated on Monday. &quot;Because this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time.&quot; </p>

<p>Schneiderman could reportedly seek court permission to demand that Trump return all of the money his organization has raised in New York, depending on the investigation&apos;s outcome. </p>
