<p>The NYPD is searching for the driver of a green taxi who allegedly ran a red light before striking a woman and her fianc&#xE9; in a Gowanus crosswalk late Saturday night. Both victims were hospitalized in stable condition. </p>

<p>The couple, both 46 years old, were crossing 7th Street at 3rd Avenue near the Gowanus music venue the Bell House just after 12:30 p.m. on Saturday when they were struck, according to the incident report. The driver, behind the wheel of a green taxi, was driving northbound on 3rd Avenue and allegedly ran a red light just before the crash. </p>

<p>The male victim told investigators that he suffered elbow, ankle and calf pain; his fianc&#xE9; sustained more serious injuries&#x2014;a head laceration, as well as a fractured pelvis, and broken fibula and tibia. Both were taken to Methodist Hospital in Park Slope. </p>

<p>No arrests have been made as of Monday morning. The NYPD is searching for a green cab, reportedly with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062317/http://abc7ny.com/traffic/woman-hurt-in-hit-and-run-involving-taxi-in-brooklyn/1350124/">front end damage</a>. </p>

<p>The TLC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
