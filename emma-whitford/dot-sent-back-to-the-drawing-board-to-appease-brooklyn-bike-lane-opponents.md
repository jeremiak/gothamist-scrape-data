<p>Brooklyn&apos;s Community Board 2 transportation committee was supposed to hold a spillover session on Thursday, to hear out nearly 70 people who didn&apos;t have time to testify earlier this week about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007074728/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/18/bike_lane_war_clinton_hill.php">proposed protected bike lane on Clinton Avenue</a>. Instead, transportation chair John Dew announced that overwhelming opposition to the DOT&apos;s proposal&#x2014;that it was ageist, discriminatory against the disabled, and downright disrespectful to drivers&#x2014;was enough to send the planners back to the drawing board. </p>

<p>The DOT will give it another shot next month. </p>

<p>&quot;It is clear that the plan proposed and presented by DOT has not yet had any input from the local community that is most impacted by this plan,&#x201D; Dew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007074728/http://www.streetsblog.org/2016/05/20/dot-defers-action-on-clinton-avenue-bikeway/">said, as reported by Streetsblog</a>. </p>

<p>To refresh, the DOT is hoping to install a north-south bike lane in a section of Brooklyn that&apos;s lacking in that department. Clinton Avenue is relatively wide, and has comparatively light car traffic since it doesn&apos;t intersect with Atlantic Avenue. The original plan called for a two-way protected bike lane on the east side of the street&#x2014;Clinton Avenue would be converted into a one-way northbound street between Gates and Flushing, and pedestrian islands would discourage speeding.</p>

<p>While the DOT and cycling advocates argued on Tuesday that the plan wouldn&apos;t only serve cyclists&#x2014;that it would result in a safer throughway for drivers and pedestrians as well&#x2014;most residents weren&apos;t having any of it. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m 100% against this plan,&quot; Esther Blunt, who lives on Vanderbilt Avenue, told us earlier this week. &quot;It&apos;s for young people; it&apos;s discriminating against the elderly. Everybody can&apos;t ride a bike. I feel like settlers have come into our community and try to tell the natives what to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Others argued that the lane would make it difficult for elderly residents to reach ambulances or Access-A-Ride. &quot;I have a problem with the people talking about the bicycles, the people riding the bicycles,&quot; said CB2 member Ruth Saunders. &quot;What about the people who are driving their cars? What about the people getting out of their cars? What about the children?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After hearing more from the community at this week&apos;s meetings on the Clinton Avenue proposal,  DOT will conduct additional outreach with community leaders and residents,&quot; a DOT spokesperson stated Friday. &quot;We look forward to returning to CB2 next month.&quot; </p>

<p>Last night&apos;s vote would have been purely advisory, ahead of a full committee meeting scheduled for June. It&apos;s worth noting that CB votes are purely advisory. And though the City has historically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007074728/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/15/williamsburg_bike_lane_wars.php">worked in lock-step</a> with local boards, Mayor de Blasio recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007074728/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/11/mayor_overrides_community_board_eff.php">bucked that trend</a> on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007074728/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/31/boulevard_of_death_will_get_protect.php">Boulevard of Death</a> in Elmhurst. Earlier this week, Upper East residents shot down a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007074728/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/upper_east_side_bike_lane_battle.php">&quot;terrible&quot; proposal</a> for bike lanes on 70th, 71st, 77th, 78th, 84th, and 85th Streets.</p>
