<p>Bed bugs don&apos;t discriminate when it comes to nesting grounds. They&apos;ll happily make room for you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130436/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/05/bedbugs_subway_nyc.php">on a crowded Q train</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130436/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/13/times_square_amc_theater.php">cuddle up at the movies</a>, or even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130436/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/27/couple_claims_city_housed_them_in_b.php">share a hotel room</a> on the Upper West Side. But in the summer months, it seems, bed bugs are smart enough to seek shelter in air conditioned offices. Last June <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130436/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/24/bed_bugs_invade_united_nations.php">it was the UN</a>. This year, City Hall.  </p>

<p>&quot;We found two dead bed bugs in a small spot in one room of the building,&quot; Mayoral spokesman Eric Phillips confirmed on Friday, following a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130436/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bed-bugs-found-new-york-city-hall-article-1.2703209">Daily News report</a>. &quot;We fumigated as a precaution.&quot; </p>

<p>The News reports that the bugs were discovered in the City Hall &quot;bull pen,&quot; where the Mayor&apos;s top aides work in an open floor plan. An e-mail from Chief of Staff Thomas Snyder reportedly addressed the problem on Thursday, rattling staffers&apos; nerves at a recent meeting. </p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t sit,&quot; one City Hall employee apparently said to another another, according to the News&apos;s anonymous internal source. &quot;There&apos;s bed bugs.&quot;</p>

<p>Or maybe it&apos;s just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130436/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bed_bug_or_creme_brulee.php">creme brulee</a>? </p>
