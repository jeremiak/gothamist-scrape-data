<p>When the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/05/mta_says_it_will_fast-track_phase_t.php">announced plans</a> last month to fast track phase two of the Second Avenue Subway&#x2014;which will extend the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/tags/secondavenuesubway">long-awaited line</a> up into East Harlem&#x2014;funding for the project seemed tenuous. While the authority insisted that it had enough money in its coffers to solicit Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for initial uptown contracts, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/28/subway_mta_second_ave.php">full $1 billion</a> had been slashed from phase two last fall, leaving the project with only $500 million to work with. </p>

<p>An earlier version of the as-yet-unfunded 2015-19 Capital Plan accounted for digging new tunnels from 96th Street to 125th Street, with work scheduled to begin in 2019; the minimal plan that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/de_blasio_2nd_ave_subay.php">made Mayor de Blasio grind his teeth</a> last November only covered moving utility lines and establishing access points for work crews and a boring machine. </p>

<p>Now $500 million has been re-allocated to phase two, according to the MTA. At a board meeting on Wednesday, the authority released another revision to its 2015-19 Capital Plan, earmarking $500 million back onto the project to be sourced from the Federal Transit Administration&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grant-programs/capital-investments/about-program">New Starts</a>&quot; program. </p>

<p>With the $500 million announced this week, the MTA hopes to get preliminary engineering work for phase two underway, and &quot;maybe get shovels in the ground&quot; relocating utilities necessary for the new stations, according to MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast. Tunnel boring still isn&apos;t expected to begin until after 2019. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ve got to be able to show people that we&apos;re serious about this project,&quot; Prendergast told reporters on Wednesday. &quot;if you took a look at the long saga of the Second Avenue Subway, there were a number of times where people said, &apos;meh, can&apos;t go forward, let&apos;s pull back.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It was a clear indication from the legislature... and our customers that the move to decrease Second Avenue Subway [funding] was unacceptable, so we needed to get to another place,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>Announcing his finalized 2016-17 budget in March, Governor Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160401/east-harlem/cuomo-earmarks-1b-for-second-avenue-subways-harlem-portion">promised to restore</a> the full $1 billion cut from phase two last fall, albeit in stages&#x2014;$500 million in 2019, and a minimum of $443 million in the next Capital Plan, covering 2020-24. </p>

<p>William Henderson, director of the watchdog group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://www.pcac.org/">Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA</a>, told us on Thursday that such commitments can be dubious. &quot;It&apos;s in the State&apos;s financial plan, but only next year&apos;s budget is binding, so what does &apos;commitment&apos; mean here?&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s basically [like saying] &apos;my word is good.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The State and City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/at_last_cuomo_and_de_blasio_have_ag.php">agreed to fund</a> the MTA&apos;s 2015-19 capital plan in October, and Prendergast, a Cuomo appointee, has insisted for months that he is confident the Governor will come through with his promised $7.3 billion (to be coupled with $2.5 billion from the city). But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/state_on_cuomos_26_billion_mta_plan.php">State legislators</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/report_cuomos_budget_punts_on_mta_c.php">independent analysts</a> have recently expressed concern that Cuomo&apos;s drafted budget proposal includes a vague promise of funding, rather than actual dollars. According to the proposal, funding will only become available once the MTA has drained all of its capital resources from years past. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s basically governance by press release,&quot; said Nick Sifuentes of the Riders Alliance in January. &quot;Cuomo basically wrote a big IOU and the IOU has no date on it.&quot;</p>

<p>Prendergast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134520/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/l_train_shutdown_update.php">said on Wednesday</a> that he is confident this latest revision to the 2015-19 Capital Plan, to the tune of $29.5 billion, will be approved in May&#x2014;even though it would be &quot;premature or inappropriate to talk about [a funding plan] because nothing&#x2019;s been landed on.&quot;<br>
