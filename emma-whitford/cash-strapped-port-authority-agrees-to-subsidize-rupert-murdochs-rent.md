<p>The Port Authority has high hopes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/23/port_authority_redesign.php">making its bus terminal less terrible</a>. In an effort to lubricate this and other projects&#x2014;and inch forward on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/leaky_oculus.php">slow-moving</a> World Trade Center site&#x2014;the interstate agency agreed on Thursday to offer Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corp. and 21st Century Fox $43 million in rent subsidies to seduce them from Midtown to the as-yet-nonexistent 2 World Trade Center. </p>

<p>Silverstein Properties, the developer constructing 2 World Trade, will in turn reimburse the Port Authority significantly, since the lease will give it the bump it needs to break ground on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/09/new_design_for_two_world_trade_cent.php#photo-1">the proposed tower</a>. </p>

<p>Port Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/nyregion/port-authority-to-pay-part-of-murdoch-companies-rent-to-lure-them-downtown.html">estimates</a> that the rent reduction, attached to a 35-year lease, would ultimately cost it about $9 million.</p>

<p>Even though the new tower won&apos;t have any public transit affiliated with it, the agency argues, the deal will benefit other public transit projects. &quot;The Port Authority is agreeing to defer an amount equal to $9 million on a project that&apos;s going to generate $500 to $600 million in capital capacity for transportation,&quot; Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/12/8585291/port-oks-subsidy-murdoch-less-planned">in a statement to Capital</a>. </p>

<p>The Port Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/port_authoritys_2015_toll_hike.html">raised tolls</a> on Hudson River bridges and tunnels last week, from $14 to $15, and agency members <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/nyregion/port-authority-to-pay-part-of-murdoch-companies-rent-to-lure-them-downtown.html?ref=nyregion">told the NY Times</a> that the sale could reduce a further increase. </p>

<p>&#x201C;This is a deal that always made sense for the Port Authority,&quot; said Silverstein-affiliated World Trade Center Properties president Janno Lieber in a statement to the paper. &quot;What makes sense about the deal is that the people of the region get a huge infusion of money for our mass transit systems and everybody gets a finished World Trade Center with a very significant increase in jobs.&quot; </p>

<p>And poor Rupert Murdoch finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325051841/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/06/11/what-rupert-murdoch-owns/71089066/">catches a break</a>. </p>
