<p>The NYPD&apos;s counterterrorism unit is ramping up security for this year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://www.usopen.org/index.html">US Open in Queens</a>, having reinforced fencing around the new 8,000-seat grandstand at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/28/us-open-security-measures/">thick cables</a> capable of withstanding a truck loaded with explosives. Increased security is a direct response to recent attacks on civilians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/15/84_killed_in_france_during_bastille.php">in Europe</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/nypd_counter-terrorism_units_on_ale.php">the United States</a>, though the NYPD has not identified any credible threats directed at the two-week tennis tournament. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve already warned people they&apos;re going to see it,&quot; event security director Michael Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/28/us-open-security-measures/">told CBS</a>, of the extra measures. &quot;And they should feel good about seeing it.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to physical fortifications, new security measures include surveillance cameras around the top of Arthur Ashe Stadium and around the periphery courts, and devices designed to detect a chemical or radiation attack. Heavily armed SWAT teams with dogs will be stationed outside the grounds where crowds cue up to enter, and&#x2014;as has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/lgbtq_bratton_stonewall.php">come to be expected</a> at large-scale NYC events&#x2014;plainclothes cops will be peppered throughout the venue. Vehicles making deliveries will be screened a quarter mile from the grounds. </p>

<p>On top of hundreds of NYPD officers, the venue will also have 300 private security guards on duty. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/event_guide/what_can_you_bring.html">lengthy list of banned items</a> ranges from expected&#x2014;alcohol, food, weapons, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/04/fail_nyc_teacher_arrested_after_cra.php#photo-1">drones</a>&#x2014;to the less-expected: selfie sticks? flags? tennis rackets? </p>

<p>Within the last decade, the US open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Layers-of-Security-Added-to-Protect-US-Open-Fans-391561951.html">established a more stringent screening process</a> for attendees than your typical sporting event, banning backpacks and replacing wand metal detectors with airport-style walkthrough detectors. </p>

<p>At the Open&apos;s kids even on Saturday, all of this heightened vigilance failed to deter one ill-intentioned attendee&#x2014;the NYPD is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/28/police_searching_for_man_who_tried_1.php">now seeking a man</a> who allegedly attempted to kidnap a girl from her seat at Arthur Ashe Stadium that afternoon. </p>

<p>The matches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050521/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/schedule/index.html?promo=sitemap">officially start today</a>, and will continue through September 11th. </p>
