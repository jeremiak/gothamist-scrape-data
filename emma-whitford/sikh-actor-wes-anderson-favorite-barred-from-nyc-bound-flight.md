<p>Ahluwalia is Indian-American and Sikh, and said that he would not remove his turban for religious reasons. &quot;That is not something that I would do in public,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708083628/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/sikh-actor-barred-aero-mexico-plane-turban-article-1.2524086">told the News</a> after the fact. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s akin to asking someone to take off their clothes.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Ahluwalia was selected for the heightened Secondary Security Screening Selection (SSSS) process before his 7:15 a.m. flight from Mexico City to New York. As a result, he was reportedly patted down at the gate and swiped for bomb residue before being asked to take off his turban. </p>

<p>The actor reportedly asked to be taken to a private room for the remainder of the screening process. The request was denied, and the airline barred him from the flight. </p>

<p>Before boarding a Delta flight to NYC on Monday afternoon, Ahluwalia posted a selfie to Instagram holding up his by-then-useless Aero Mexico ticket with the SSSS classification.</p>

<p>In another post, he warned the fashion community at large that he might be a bit late to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708083628/http://www.amny.com/lifestyle/fashion-week/new-york-fashion-week-an-insider-s-guide-1.11435857">NYC Fashion Week</a>. </p>

<p>Aero Mexico said in a statement that Ahluwalia &#x201C;was asked to submit to screening and inspection before boarding, in strict compliance with TSA protocol,&quot; adding, &quot;we sincerely regret any inconvenience caused by this incident.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Last month, four Brooklyn men&#x2014;three Muslims and a Sikh&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708083628/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/18/flying_while_muslim.php">sued American Airlines</a> after they were banned from a flight from Toronto, allegedly because they were making the crew &quot;uneasy.&quot; And in December, a Virgin Airlines crew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708083628/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/flight_misunderstanding.php">barred Texas lawyer Bobby Abtahi</a> from his flight to Dallas, allegedly because they did not feel &quot;comfortable&quot; having him on board. The airline later apologized, calling the incident a &quot;misunderstanding.&quot;</p>
