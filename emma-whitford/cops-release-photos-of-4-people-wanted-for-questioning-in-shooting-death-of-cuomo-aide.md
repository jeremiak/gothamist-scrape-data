<p>The NYPD has released photos of three men and one woman wanted for questioning in the predawn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/08/cuomo_aide_gabay_shot.php">shooting death</a> of Governor Cuomo administration lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/gabay_fatal_shooting.php">Carey Gabay</a> on September 7th last year, during the J&apos;Ouvert street party that proceeds the annual West Indian Day Parade in Crown Heights. </p>

<p>The three men are believed to be between 25 and 30 years old, and the woman is believed to be between 18 and 20. It was not immediately clear why investigators believe the four individuals may have knowledge of, or involvement in, the shooting.  </p>

<p>Gabay, 43, was shot in the head around 3:40 a.m. on September 7th, amid crossfire that the NYPD believes to have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/gang-slay-eyed-gov-cuomo-aide-murder-article-1.2370574">gang related</a>. According to the police, Gabay was walking north on Bedford Avenue between Sullivan Place and Montgomery Street when shots broke out, and attempted to dive for cover between two cars. The Harvard Law School graduate remained on life support for nine days before his family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/gabay_fatal_shooting.php">decided to take him off</a>. </p>

<p>A few days after the shooting, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/10/carey_gabay_shooting.php">released a sketch</a> of a man who was allegedly on the scene, based on witness descriptions. A few days later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/12/nypd_releases_video_of_suspects_in_1.php">surveillance video</a> was released showing two male suspects, both armed, running into 1680 Bedford Avenue near where the shooting took place. In October, cops sent out additional surveillance footage of one of the two male suspects, whose picture appears to be among the four released today. </p>

<p>On Wednesday evening, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams is planning to make a joint announcement with NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton on plans to combat violence at J&apos;Ouvert 2016. </p>

<p>In the shooting&apos;s immediate aftermath, Commissioner Bratton called the weekend as a whole &quot;our most violent public event in the city,&quot; and Crain&apos;s New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/blogs/polls/2015/09/should-the-city-stop-allowing-the-west-indian-celebration-on-labor-day/">published an online poll</a> asking, &quot;Should the city ban the West Indian Day parade?&quot;</p>

<p>But many have countered that lumping J&apos;ouvert and the West Indian Day Parade into a single episode, and labeling it violent, only serves to distract New Yorkers from the larger issue at play. &quot;We should utilize the carnival as a platform to discuss issues of gun violence in Brooklyn,&quot; Crown Heights Councilwoman Laurie Cumbo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/nyregion/violence-casts-a-shadow-over-jouvert-celebration-in-brooklyn.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a>.</p>

<p>Ruddy Roye, a Bed-Stuy-based Instagram photographer and activist, arrived at J&apos;ouvert shortly before 4:00 a.m. last year, and witnessed the NYPD response to Gabay&apos;s shooting. &quot;The NRA continues to lobby for more guns,&quot; he told us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108050025/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/09/jouvert_violence_brooklyn.php">that week</a>. &quot;Before we go canceling one of our only demonstrations of Caribbean culture, maybe we should find ways to get guns off of the street.&quot;</p>
