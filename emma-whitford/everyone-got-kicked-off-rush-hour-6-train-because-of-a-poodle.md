<p>The MTA decided to take an entire 6 train out of service during rush hour on Tuesday after straphangers spotted a small dog riding the subway unattended, proof that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071840/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/21/mta_updates_prolific_see_something.php">Real New Yorkers Who See Something And Say Something Campaign</a> is working  well. </p>

<p>Delays only lasted for about 10 minutes according to the MTA, and the poodle ended up in Animal Care Centers of New York custody. If no one claims the dog in the next 72 hours he&apos;ll be put up for adoption.<br>
