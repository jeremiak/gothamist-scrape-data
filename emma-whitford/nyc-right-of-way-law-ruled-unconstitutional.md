<p>A Queens judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2016/06/27/queens-judge-rules-key-portion-of-mayor-s-vision-zero-plan-is-unconstitutional.html?cid=twitter_InsideCityHall">ruled on Friday</a> that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/14/reckless_driving_nyc_nypd.php">Right of Way Law</a>, which empowers beat cops to charge reckless drivers who kill or injure pedestrians walking with the right of way, is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Queens Criminal Court Judge Gia Morris released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2016/2016_26199.htm">the ruling</a> on Friday in favor of Isaac Sanson, a school bus driver who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/26/bus_driver_arrest_queens.php">fatally struck 85-year-old Jeanine Deutsch in December 2014</a> as she crossed the street in Forest Hills. Sanson was one of the first NYC drivers to be charged with the Right of Way law, which made failure to yield a misdemeanor offense carrying maximum penalties of a $500 fine and 30 days in jail. </p>

<p>Previously, unless an NYPD officer witnessed the crash, drivers had to be intoxicated or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://www.streetsblog.org/2012/02/22/is-there-really-a-rule-of-two/">break numerous laws</a> in order to face consequences. </p>

<p>In her ruling, Morris argued that because drivers can be charged under the Right of Way law even if their intentionality or awareness of committing a violent act can&apos;t be proven, the law violates Sanson&apos;s due process. </p>

<p>&quot;The very fabric of our criminal justice system is that an accused person stands before a court innocent until proven guilty, and is entitled to significant constitutional protections separate and distinct from a civil case,&#x201D; Morris wrote.</p>

<p>It&apos;s true that the vast majority of criminal convictions hinge on a court&apos;s assessment of the perpetrator&apos;s mental state&#x2014;whether he was aware of, or intentional about, the crime. Whereas in civil cases, a judge must only decide that the perpetrator failed to be &quot;reasonably prudent.&quot;</p>

<p>But safe streets advocates argue that the same burden of proof applied to failure to yield also applies to drunk driving, also a criminal offense. </p>

<p>&quot;There is absolutely no awareness of wrongdoing that is required in order to hold someone who strikes a pedestrian while driving drunk criminally liable,&quot; attorney Steve Vaccaro, a safe streets advocate who represents victims of traffic violence, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://www.streetsblog.org/2016/06/28/advocates-dont-expect-judges-ruling-against-right-of-way-law-to-hold-up/">told Streetsblog this week</a>. &quot;All that needs to be shown is that the person is in a state of intoxication and that the person&apos;s car hit another, period.&quot;</p>

<p>Responding to Judge Morris&apos;s ruling on Thursday, Transportation Alternatives director Paul Steely White pointed out that the Right of Way law was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/bus_drivers_right_of_way.php">amended last fall</a>, to explicitly define the driver&apos;s responsibility as &quot;that care which is exercised by a reasonably prudent driver.&quot; The amendment was part of a settlement with Transportation Workers Local 100, which sued the city after six MTA bus drivers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/16/bus_mta_vision_zero.php">arrested and charged with misdemeanors</a> for failing to exercise due care and fatally striking pedestrians. </p>

<p>&quot;The reference to civil negligence standards in the statute itself makes unmistakable that City Council members who adopted [the Right of Way law] intended to apply criminal penalties based on a civil negligence standard,&quot; he stated. &quot;Judge Morris&#x2019; decision fails to acknowledge that legislators can and do apply criminal penalties based on negligence.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio&apos;s office issued a statement Tuesday indicating that the city will continue to enforce the Right Of Way Law, regardless of this ruling. </p>

<p>&quot;[The law] is a vital tool to hold accountable drivers who seriously injure or kill pedestrians with the right of way while driving dangerously,&quot; said a de Blasio spokesperson. &quot;This is an important piece of Vision Zero&#x2019;s comprehensive approach to reducing death and serious injury on the streets. We disagree with the court&#x2019;s non-binding decision and will continue to investigate, enforce, and charge this law.&quot; </p>

<p>Queens DA Richard Brown told Streetsblog that his office is considering an appeal stating, &quot;We are studying the decision and weighing our appellate options.&quot; </p>

<p>Setting aside the question of its constitutionality, reports suggest that the Right of Way law has been underutilized. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101140245/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/deadly_drivers_nyc.php">report issued by Transportation Alternatives last December</a>, drivers who failed to yield caused 5,966 crashes resulting in death or injury last year. In that same time period, only 24 drivers were charged. </p>
