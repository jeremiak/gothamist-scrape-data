<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo is planning to celebrate the opening of half of the new Kosciuszko Bridge Thursday night with a &apos;spectacular&apos; Top 40-coordinated LED-light show, his office confirmed Monday. The plan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425035552/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/kosciuszko-bridge-flashy-thursday-debut-featuring-cuomo-article-1.3089276">first reported</a> by the Daily News, is significantly less pyrotechnical than the old Kosciuszko Bridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425035552/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/22/bridge_bye.php">implosion</a> planned for Summer 2017. </p>

<p>The Queens-bound span of the bridge will be open to traffic in both directions on Thursday, according to Cuomo&apos;s office. The aforementioned implosion will clear the way for the bridge&apos;s second phase, which will begin construction this May. </p>

<p>The new bridge in its entirety is scheduled for completion by 2020, with five Queens-bound lanes on one span, and four Brooklyn-bound lanes plus a bike lane/walkway on the other. Until then, the Queens-bound side of the bridge will carry three lanes of traffic in both directions, connecting Greenpoint to Maspeth on the Queens side. </p>

<p>Thursday&apos;s LED show will be the first &quot;performance&quot; in Cuomo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425035552/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/ny_bridges_tolls_light_art.php#photo-1">New York Harbor of Lights</a> project, a larger plan for LED-illuminate bridges across the city announced last October. Cuomo, who is a big fan of large-scale infrastructure projects (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425035552/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/05/andrew_cuomo_budget_hypocrisy.php"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425035552/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/05/andrew_cuomo_budget_hypocrisy.php">available funding notwithstanding</a>), waxed on the &quot;limitless&quot; possibilities of illuminated bridges: as eye candy, and as tourist magnets. </p>

<p>&quot;Just imagine the possibilities when you illuminate all of those crossings,&quot; Cuomo said at the time. &quot;They can all be choreographed, they can all be synchronized, they can all be the same color, they can operate in series.&quot; </p>

<p>The lights will turn on Thursday at 7:00 p.m., and will coordinate with the spire of the Empire State Building. Cuomo will stand by the bridge for some remarks, alongside massive speakers. Tune into iHeartRadio to experience the sound-and-light show from afar. </p>

<p>Cuomo&apos;s office has yet to set a final date for the old bridge explosion. </p>

<p>LED lights will be installed on all seven MTA bridges and tunnels in NYC by May 2018, according to the Governor&apos;s Office. The full list includes the Henry Hudson Bridge, Whitestone Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, RFK Triborough Bridge, Queens Midtown Tunnel, Hugh L. Carey Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, and George Washington Bridge.</p>
