<p>Maybe your calves are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/washington_square_park_bernie.php">still sore</a> from standing in line for Bernie Sanders&apos;s Vampire Weekend concert last night. Or maybe you&apos;re still shaking out the cobwebs from that fever dream in which Ted and Heidi Cruz drive back and forth to the grocery store in a flatbed truck stacked with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gawker.com/after-his-honeymoon-ted-cruz-immediately-bought-100-ca-1770893594">cans of Campbell&apos;s Chunky soup</a>. Perhaps John Kasich is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/03/john-kasich-pizza-fork-defense.html">eating</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://ny.eater.com/2016/4/7/11387592/john-kasich-mikes-deli">eating and eating</a>) in your mind&apos;s eye. Or maybe you&apos;re just squinting against the possibility of another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/12/trump_rally_violence_america.php">classy display of violence</a> when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/27/photo_you_can_visit_donald_trumps_t.php">Native New Yorker Who Shall Not Be Named</a> rolls back into town. Sad! There&apos;s no time for dwelling in the past this Thursday, because all five presidential candidates are in NYC today, and they&apos;re all vying for your attention. Pay attention to them they are pandering so hard for you!</p>

<p>The big, national broadcast event is tonight&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/05/battle_of_brooklyn_clinton_sanders.php">Democratic debate</a> at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, at 9:00 p.m. The event is the hard-fought result of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/03/the_great_clinton-sanders_ny_debate.php">a lot of quibbling</a> from both campaigns. It&apos;s the first face-off between Sanders and Clinton since March 9th in Miami. </p>

<p>The debate is invite-only, and each campaign has a capped number of tickets to distribute. Earlier this week we tipped you off to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/https://www.google.com/?ion=1&amp;espv=2#q=tickets%20gothamist%20democratic%20debate">sidedoor approach</a>&#x2014;call the NY State Democratic Committee at (212) 725-8825 and cross your fingers&#x2014;but we imagine that trick has had diminishing returns since Monday. Luckily the event is being broadcast live on TV, is streaming on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://www.cnn.com/">CNN.com</a> (no need for a login), and there are going to be<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/44r48"> many</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/16/web-where-to-watch-debate-2016-04-15-bk.html">many</a> debate-watching parties. </p>

<p>Earlier in the evening, all three GOP candidates are scheduled to speak at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://newyork.gop/gala">New York State Republican Gala</a>, a black tie fundraiser at the Grand Hyatt New York that cost $1,000 per ticket. Thousands of protesters and advocacy groups&#x2014;including Millions March NYC, NYC Shut It Down and Fight for $15&#x2014;have been preparing for the event for weeks. </p>

<p>The protest is scheduled to start at 5:30&#x2014;peak rush hour&#x2014;outside the Grand Hyatt, 109 East 42nd Street at Grand Central Terminal.

<p>&#x201C;Trump&apos;s rhetoric is an instigation to racist, anti-migrant and misogynist violence,&quot; said KaLisa Moore of Peoples Power Assembly in a statement. &quot;As a matter of self-defense and protection of New Yorkers, we intend to do what the city&apos;s elected so-called leaders refuse to do-and shut down Trump from spreading his hateful message.&quot; While violence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/https://www.rawstory.com/2016/04/trump-fans-threaten-gun-violence-against-protesters-ahead-of-pittsburgh-visit/">has been trending</a> at Trump&apos;s rallies in recent weeks, protesters haven&apos;t successfully shut down an event since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://chicagoist.com/2016/03/11/photos_trump_supporters_and_protest.php">Trump&#x2019;s University of Illinois-Chicago rally</a>. </p>

<p>After the gala, Cruz and Kasich will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://deadline.com/2016/04/donald-trump-skips-msnbc-gop-town-hall-thursday-1201736412/">schlep out of the city</a> for back-to-back Republican Town Halls airing on MSNBC&#x2014;Kasich with Chris Matthews in Jericho, NY at 7:00, and Cruz with Chuck Todd in Buffalo at 8:00. The last time Trump sat down with MSNBC, on March 30th, he suggested that women should be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html">punished for seeking abortions</a>. He&apos;s skipping that forum tonight. </p>

<p>To refresh, the polls: Clinton is still showing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://www.newsweek.com/how-watch-livestream-next-democratic-presidential-debate-brooklyn-447540">double-digit lead</a> over Sanders, with help from black voters and Democrats over the age of 45. Clinton currently has 1,758 delegates to Bernie&apos;s 1,069. There are 291 Democratic delegates at stake in New York. On the Republican side, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hold-strong-leads-in-new-york-ahead-of-states-primary-1460408449">Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist poll</a> is showing Trump with 33 points over Kasich, 54% to 21%. Cruz is trailing with only 18% of the possible votes. Oh, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/vote-john-kasich-ny-article-1.2600187">Daily News endorsed Kasich</a>. </p>

<p>On into the weekend, Sanders is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/bernie_sanders_plans_prospect_park.php">bringing you a hangover cure</a> in the form of a Prospect Park rally on Sunday. Gates open at noon and music starts at 3 p.m. The general admission entrance is on the east side of the park near the boathouse (RSVP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/rally/44trq">here</a>). Danny Devito, Justin Long and Grizzly Bear will be there. </p>

<p>With all of this excitement, don&apos;t forget to vote on Tuesday, assuming you&apos;re a Democrat or Republican (the other 3 million of you might as well just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/12/ny_primary_battle_independent.php">send positive vibes</a>). </p>
