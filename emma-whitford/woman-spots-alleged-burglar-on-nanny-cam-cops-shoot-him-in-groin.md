The 38-year-old burglar, identified as one Felix Perez, fled on foot and was arrested about a block from the scene in a neighbor&apos;s back yard. <p></p>

<p>While the arrest was underway, cops say they discovered a 36-year-old woman lying in a nearby driveway with a head laceration. The driveway was less than a block from 55-38 66th Street, where the alleged burglary took place, but the NYPD says the two incidents were unrelated. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015812/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/queens_shooting_maspeth.php">Initial reports</a> suggested that this woman was injured as a result of the police encounter, and there was speculation that police had shot the woman, prompting NYPD spokesman J. Peter Donald to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015812/https://twitter.com/JPeterDonald/status/760205282899292160">tweet</a>, &quot;This is completely inaccurate. No one is dead.&quot;  </p>

<p>Addressing reporters near the scene on Monday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said that two cops from the 104th Precinct responded to a robbery call at 55-38 66th Street, near the corner of Hull Avenue, at 1:30 p.m. The caller, a woman who lived on the building&apos;s first floor, told police she&apos;d glimpsed a robber in her child&apos;s bedroom, over live video stream. (A security camera in the room sent surveillance video to her cellphone.) </p>

<p>The woman&apos;s dog was apparently inside the apartment. &quot;She was afraid for her dog the entire time,&quot; Boyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015812/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspected-burglar-shot-groin-police-queens-article-1.2734388">told reporters</a>. </p>

<p>Video taken from an apartment across the street, and shared with Gothamist by a tipster, shows the woman approaching the front door to her building, which is ajar. She enters through the front door, and exits moments later with her small dog in her arms. A gun shot rings out from inside the building, followed by a scream. A person runs out of the building, and uniformed police follow. </p>

<p>According to police, one officer encountered Perez in the apartment&apos;s back room. A &quot;struggle&quot; ensued, and the officer fired one round, striking Perez in the groin. Boyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015812/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160801/maspeth/police-involved-shooting-queens-sends-2-people-hospital-fdny">told the press</a> that Perez ran out of a room and assaulted one of the officers before the shot rang out. &quot;This was a close quarters encounter,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Perez fled after he was shot, and was arrested nearby. The NYPD described his record of prior burglaries as &quot;extensive.&quot; </p>

<p>Perez was taken to Booth Memorial Hospital, where his condition has been listed as stable. The 36-year-old woman discovered in a nearby driveway was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, where doctors removed what appears to have been a short piece of wire cable from her scalp. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108015812/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160801/maspeth/police-involved-shooting-queens-sends-2-people-hospital-fdny">DNAinfo reports</a> that there were several pieces of wire in the driveway, and that cops believe the woman may have fallen, injuring herself. </p>

<p>The officers did not sustain injuries. </p>

<p>Police said Monday that they are interviewing the woman to try to determine how she was injured. An investigation into the alleged robbery attempt is ongoing. </p>
