<p>Governor Cuomo has vetoed State legislation that would have instated a second free transfer for commuters who have to take two buses and a train to get to work, doubling the customary single free transfer within two hours of the initial swipe. The governor, who turned a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/25/cuomo_bus_ted.php">blind eye</a> on the MTA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/24/mta_money_cuomo.php">budgetary crisis</a> until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/at_last_cuomo_and_de_blasio_have_ag.php">quite recently</a>, justified his decision as a money saver for an already strapped system. <br>
 <br>
&quot;The MTA estimates it would cost approximately $40 million annually to provide a second free transfer, yet the bill does not provide any funding to account for this expense,&quot; the governor wrote in his veto message. </p>

<p>The bill, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/19/more_of_a_shelbyville_idea.php">passed the Senate and Assembly this June</a>, would have allowed commuters to swipe on two buses and one train for a single fare. </p>

<p>According to an official statement from the MTA, the addition of a second free transfer would cost &quot;nearly&quot; $40 million in annual revenue. &quot;If this bill were enacted, each weekday over 50,000 full-fare and reduced fare customers would gain a free ride,&quot; said MTA Chairman Counselor Stephen Morello. &quot;In addition, adding another automatic transfer for pay-per-ride MetroCards would be a severe challenge.&quot; </p>

<p>The MTA also argued that &quot;an easy remedy already exists&quot; for commuters who must make two transfers in a single commute, in the form of an unlimited MetroCard. However, sponsoring Bronx Assemblyman Jeff Dinowitz countered that the unlimited MetroCard is not a feasible option for many commuters who live far from the city center. &quot;It&apos;s just not fair for people who, through no fault of their own, have to take three rides and are in a two-fare zone,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://nypost.com/2015/06/20/new-bill-would-double-free-transfers-on-metrocards/">told the Post</a>. </p>

<p>This is the second time in a number of weeks that the transportation authority has formally opposed legislation aimed towards alleviating the economic burden of commuting for New Yorkers living in the city&apos;s so-called &quot;transportation deserts,&quot; on the grounds of budgetary limits. At a City Council meeting earlier this month, the MTA opposed legislation that would have allowed New Yorkers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/12/lirr_metro_north_nyc.php">pay a subway-equivalent $2.75 fare</a> on the Long Island Railroad or Metro-North within city limits, and transfer to the subway or bus for free.</p>

<p>This, the MTA estimated, would impact 14.5 million customers a year, and cost the MTA $70 million annually. </p>

<p>According to a recent report from the Regional Plan Association entitled Overlooked Boroughs [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://library.rpa.org/pdf/RPA-Overlooked-Boroughs-Technical-Report.pdf">PDF</a>], close to 90% of NYC&apos;s 8.2 million residents live outside of Manhattan south of 125th Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/more-people-commute-to-manhattan-than-any-other-county/">The NY Times reported in 2013</a> that 370,000 Queens residents and 191,000 Bronx residents commute into Manhattan daily.</p>

<p>City data shows that two thirds of New Yorkers who commute more than an hour in each direction make less than $35,000 per year. This spring, the price of a monthly unlimited MetroCard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/22/mta_subway_fare_hike.php">jumped</a> from $112 to $116.50. </p>

<p>Gene Russianoff, a spokesman for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025134046/http://www.straphangers.org/">Straphangers Campaign</a>, told us over the summer that he supported the double-transfer legislation. </p>

<p>&quot;There are some policies that make sense,&quot; he said. &quot;I grew up in Sheepshead Bay, where you had to take two buses to make it to the train. The question is, why should those people [on bus lines] pay more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are a lot of things the MTA could do that would be good,&quot; he added. &quot;But can they afford them?&quot; </p>
