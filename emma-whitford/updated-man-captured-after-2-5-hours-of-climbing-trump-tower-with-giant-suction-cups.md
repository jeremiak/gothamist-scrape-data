Iorio said that the climber, who appeared to be in &quot;great shape,&quot; took out signs from his backpack mid-climb to show to people inside the building. When cops broke a window and dismantled an air conditioning vent near the climber, he maneuvered away from them. </p>

<p>TV networks are reporting the climber&apos;s name is Steve, and that he&apos;s from Virginia. </p>

<p>&quot;Steve&quot; apparently also dropped a laptop and a notebook with messages during the initial part of his climb.</p>

<p><b>[Update 6:25 p.m.]</b>: Michael Cohen, a VP in the Trump organization and his legal council released this statement (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612143827/https://twitter.com/ABC7NY/status/763500307091365888">Eyewitness News</a>). &quot;This man performed a ridiculous and dangerous stunt. There&apos;s damage to the building and he caused the unnecessary deployment of New York&apos;s finest to protect his safety and the safety of everyone in the building. He&apos;s caused the shutdown of traffic on Fifth Avenue. I&apos;m 100 percent certain the NYPD had better things to do. If Mr. Trump were here he&apos;d be thankig law encorcement for the job they&apos;re doing.&quot;</p>

<p>He&apos;s currently around the 20th floor, and a police source says he&apos;s carrying leaflets which are &quot;about self promotion,&quot; though it&apos;s unclear what he&apos;s promoting. </p>

<p><b>[Update 6:35]</b>: The police grabbed him and brought him into the building through a window.</p>
