title: Some Brooklyn NIMBYs Fear Citi Bike Will Bring Undesirables Who Don't Own Bikes

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="062816_BK.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/062816_BK.jpeg" width="320" height="426"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> Found on Douglass Street (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://www.streetsblog.org/2016/06/29/bike-share-nimby-flyer-make-cobble-hill-great-again/">via Streetsblog</a>). </i></div> Some doomsday Brooklyn NIMBYs are on the warpath against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike</a> and have been putting up these flyers around neighborhoods like Cobble Hill, which will soon be getting new bike share docking stations. <p></p>

<p>&quot;Say NO To Citibikes Here,&quot; it reads, lumping the bike share program into a buffet of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/27/nimbys_racism_nyer.php">homeowner concerns</a> ranging from the possibility of express F train service (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/flip_flop_express.php">not a definite</a>, as the poster suggests), to the proliferation of high-rises. And, <em>gasp,</em> outsiders who<em> do not own their own bicycles.</em></p>

<p>We weren&apos;t able to track down the fist-shakers behind the posters, which were spotted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://www.streetsblog.org/2016/06/29/bike-share-nimby-flyer-make-cobble-hill-great-again/">Streetsblog</a>, but Community Board 6 District Manager Craig Hammerman says he&apos;s gotten several complaints recently about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/20/citi_bike_expansion_2016.php">this summer&apos;s Citi Bike expansion</a>, ever since the DOT started notifying homeowners. </p>

<p>&quot;Some people are now just learning about the program despite the fact that there&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/28/citi_bike_saved.php">really heavy media coverage</a> for years,&quot; said Hammerman, who&apos;s very pro-Citi Bike. &quot;We had an extremely robust public planning process that people didn&apos;t tune into until they were faced with a dock planned for their block.&quot; </p>

<p>The majority of complaints have been directed at planned stations on the corner of Carroll Street and 3rd Avenue in Gowanus, and Clinton Street and First Place in Carroll Gardens&#x2014;a quiet brownstone block with wide, grassy front yards. In classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/18/bike_lane_war_clinton_hill.php">bike-skeptic fashion</a>, locals are primarily concerned about the loss of parking spaces, Hammerman said. </p>

<p>A third of the 73 docking stations planned for CB6, he added, will be on the sidewalk rather than the street. </p>

<p>&quot;Frankly, it&apos;s irresponsible to get people riled up using hyperbole,&quot; Hammerman added.  &quot;Also they can be ticketed for putting a sign up on a streetlight pole, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030141512/http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1720/flyer-or-poster-complaint">which is illegal</a>.&quot; </p>
