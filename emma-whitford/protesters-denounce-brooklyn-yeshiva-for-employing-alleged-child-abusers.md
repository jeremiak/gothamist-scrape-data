<p>A small group of protesters gathered on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights on Sunday to denounce the longtime employment of allegedly abusive teachers at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/https://www.oholeitorah.com/">Oholei Torah</a>, one of the largest and most prestigious boys yeshivas in Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/http://www.chabad.org/">Chabad</a> network. The protesters&#x2014;including members of the Lubavitch community, survivors, and alumni&#x2014;held signs that read &quot;What would the Rebbe say?&quot; and &quot;Abuse isn&apos;t chinuch [education].&quot; A row of strategically-parked yellow school buses blocked them from the yeshiva&apos;s front entrance, where parents, teachers and rabbis ducked through the light snow into Oholei Torah&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/https://www.oholeitorah.com/dinner01.php">annual gala dinner</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;The culture of violence is being celebrated tonight,&quot; said Chaim Levin, an alumnus of the school and a survivor of sexual abuse. Earlier this month, Newsweek published a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/http://www.newsweek.com/2016/03/11/child-abuse-allegations-hasidic-ultraorthodox-jewish-community-brooklyn-432688.html">lengthy investigation</a> into physical and sexual abuse across Brooklyn&apos;s Chabad yeshiva network. Victims, Levin among them, accused Oholei Torah&apos;s longtime principal, Rabbi Hershel Lustig, of deftly covering up child abuse and employing two known abusers. </p>

<p>In 2013, Rabbi Velvel Karp allegedly tossed a student so hard into a pane of glass that the child sustained a concussion. Multiple alumni told Newsweek that Karp often hit his students across the face, and even hung boys out of his fourth-floor classroom window by their shirts. </p>

<p>Another current teacher, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Zalmanov, allegedly hit a student so hard that the boy slammed into a closet, smacking his head on hardwood. According to the boy&apos;s mother, Zalmanov showed little remorse. &quot;For chutzpah [impudence], I patsh [smack],&quot; he allegedly said.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn DA&apos;s office launched an investigation into the glass pane incident, and the detective on the case later told Newsweek that &quot;an extensive investigation was conducted, but no one wanted to talk.&quot; Oholei Torah countered that it cooperated fully. </p>

<p>Traditional Jewish law prohibits <em>mesirah</em>, or bringing allegations against other Jews to secular authorities. The Crown Heights rabbinical court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/nyregion/ultra-orthodox-jews-shun-their-own-for-reporting-child-sexual-abuse.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">officially exempted</a> allegations of sexual assault in 2011 (according to the ruling, &quot;one is forbidden to remain silent in such situations&quot;), but some participants in Sunday&apos;s rally said that fear still plays a significant role in compelling parents and community members to keep quiet. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not just this school,&quot; said 41-year-old Shula Haber, a Lubavitch single mother. &quot;I know there are a lot of people who wish they could be here, but they&apos;re afraid.&quot; Haber recently pulled her 9-year-old son from another Lubavitch school in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Only one current Oholei Torah parent attended Sunday&apos;s protest, and she asked to remain anonymous for fear that her sons, ages 11 and 12, could suffer retribution. &quot;I&apos;m not against the school. I&apos;m against the teachers who shouldn&apos;t be here,&quot; she said. &quot;At the very least I would hope that the principal would come out and apologize.&quot; She added that she believes it is the parents&apos; responsibility to demand accountability. &quot;I would hope more of them would want accountability, but I don&apos;t see other parents here.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Many teachers are really wonderful, but it doesn&apos;t excuse everything else,&quot; she added. </p>

<p>In an e-mail forwarded to Gothamist, Rabbi Nochem Kaplan of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/http://www.chinuchoffice.org/">Merkos Chinuch Office</a>, which trains teachers and sets guidelines for yeshivas within the Chabad-Lubavitch network, denied responsibility for Oholei Torah. &quot;The Merkos Chinuch Office has published a child Safety Code which all mosdos [schools] are expected to adopt,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We take no position regarding individual [schools] and how they implement the code.&quot; </p>

<p>Oholei Torah issued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/http://forward.com/news/335778/elite-chabad-yeshiva-says-school-is-free-of-abuse-despite-newsweek-expose/">its own statement</a> to the Jewish news outlet The Forward soon after the Newsweek piece was published. &quot;We follow the guidelines of... the Chabad education arm,&quot; wrote Rabbi Lustig. &quot;Those guidelines are in line with the law.&quot; </p>

<p>The school also sent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215326/http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=39650">a letter</a> to parents, outlining safety precautions&#x2014;every classroom door has a window, for example, and every teacher is required to sign a contract listing safety rules. &quot;[We] categorically assure you that there is absolutely no abuse taking place at Oholei Torah that we know of,&quot; it reads. </p>

<p>As darkness fell, one couple crossed the barricade of school buses and joined the protesters. The man wore a blue suit, and his wife held a glass of wine. Speaking under the condition of anonymity because of their involvement in the school community, they defended Oholei Torah. &quot;Any school has a few bad apples,&quot; the woman said. &quot;We&apos;re talking about a few people in a school of 1,800 students.&quot; She added that the school could not fire teachers without solid evidence, but conceded that some parents might feel &quot;scared to come forward.&quot; </p>

<p>The husband attended Oholei Torah as a child. &quot;I was hit by my teachers in this school,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw teachers pull down boys&apos; pants and spank them until their bottoms were swollen.&quot; He said that he sends his two sons to Oholei Torah for the elite religious education. &quot;I would not put my child in a class with an abuser,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the school is good.&quot; </p>

<p>Oholei Torah did not immediately respond to a request for comment about last night&apos;s action.</p>
