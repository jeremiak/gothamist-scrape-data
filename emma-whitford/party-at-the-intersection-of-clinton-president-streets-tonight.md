<p>Amanda Zinoman, a documentary film editor, stood outside of PS 29 in Cobble Hill this morning spreading the word about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/https://www.facebook.com/events/983952915050494/?notif_t=plan_user_invited&amp;notif_id=1478621036972713">party she has planned</a> for the intersection of Clinton and President Streets in Carroll Gardens tonight. &quot;It&apos;s going to be Clinton between President and Carroll,&quot; she said. &quot;We wanted President and Union but there&apos;s a polling place there so we couldn&apos;t do it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s time for a woman,&quot; she added. &quot;Enough already. I just think it will be a better government with more women in it.&quot; </p>

<p>The block will be closed to cars from 7-10 p.m., and Zinoman says she&apos;s obtained the necessary NYPD permit, plus a projector screen and sound system. She&apos;s also anticipating the desire to booze: &quot;If you are going to bring alcohol, please be inconspicuous,&quot; she warns in the Facebook invite. &quot;I really don&apos;t want to see anyone getting a citation!!!&quot; </p>

<p>If deep Brownstone Brooklyn isn&apos;t your thing, here are <strong>a few more alternatives to biting all of your nails off at home tonight</strong>. Feel free to post any group hugs we missed in the comments. </p>

<p>The second Tuesday of every month, the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/https://www.facebook.com/events/849880458481547/">Society for the Advancement of Social Studies (SASS!)</a></strong> hosts free lectures on a historical topic that &quot;you probably knew at one point but don&#x2019;t remember anymore&quot; at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/https://www.facebook.com/BackBarAtTheBedfordOnBedford/">Backbar at The Bedford</a> in Williamsburg. Tonight, you can distract yourself with presidential trivia, themed drinks, and lectures including &quot;Crazy Presidential Campaigns (That Aren&#x2019;t The Current One).&quot; Doors at 7:00, lectures at 7:30, all free. </p>

<p>In an act of predictability to rival the Clinton-President crowd, the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/http://nyyrc.com/">New York Young Republican Club</a></strong> is hunkering down at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/https://www.facebook.com/turnmillnyc/">Turnmill</a> at 119 E 27th Street near Madison Square Park starting around 6:30 tonight. They don&apos;t have any special events planned&#x2014;&quot;just watching&quot; spokesman Roger Sacher said. Anyone who shows up with a videocamera will be turned away, he added. &quot;It&apos;s a tight venue... not enough room for them.&quot; </p>

<p>For the costume-inclined, <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/http://houseofyes.org/">House Of Yes</a></strong> is going heavy on the puns with its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hit-the-poles-erection-day-political-party-tickets-28872454288">Hit the POLES! Erection Day Political Party</a>. (&quot;Vote hard, come harder! Cast your ballot into our box!&quot; etc. etc.). The event is free, starting around 7:00, though the venue is asking guests to register. Expect poll dancing, and $100 cash prize for the best &quot;clever and witty&quot; costume. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/http://www.littlefieldnyc.com/event/1351791-political-subversities-brooklyn/">Littlefield</a></strong>, the textile warehouse turned venue in Gowanus, rounded up a group of comedians to offer a simple salve: &quot;LIVE ELECTION RESULTS and comedians to make you feel better about it.&quot; This one starts at 7:30 at 622 Degraw Street, doors at 7:00, and will set you back $10-15. Comedian Aparna Nancherla will be there, and she&apos;s already warming up. </p>

<p>If scanning back and forth between television screen and Twitter feed doesn&apos;t afford enough sensory overload, <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/http://www.brooklynbowl.com/event/1351989">Brooklyn Bowl is piling it on</a></strong> with improv jam sessions from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/http://everyoneorchestra.com/">Everyone Orchestra</a> to accompany each state&apos;s returns. Musicians include members of The Big Gigantic and the Trey Anastasio Band. Also, every TV and projector in the venue will be tuned to election results. This one will set you back a bit more: $25 for general admission. </p>

<p>And if you&apos;re just in the market for a really big projection screen, <strong>National Sawdust on North 6th Street</strong> is setting up a 16 x 9-footer. RSVP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111072657/https://nationalsawdust.org/event/election-night-party/?utm_source=social">here</a>.<br>

Here are some more recommendations</a> on where to drink and watch the returns come in.</p>
