<p>A cyclist is in critical condition after being struck by a dump truck driver at the intersection of Jay and Tillary streets in Downtown Brooklyn at approximately 7:03 this morning, according to the FDNY and NYPD. Numerous police were still on the scene just before 9:00 a.m., and had cordoned off a section of the intersection surrounding the crash site and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030534/http://www.mactrailer.com/">MAC Trailer</a> dump truck. A helmet lay in the crosswalk, as well as items including what appeared to be a Tupperware container. Blood was also visible in the crosswalk. </p>

<p>The victim, a 35-year-old male, was transported to Methodist Hospital. While a fire department spokesman said that the victim was not likely to die, a spokesman for the NYPD said that the department had received notice that he was in critical condition, with head and leg trauma. We&apos;ll update with any further clarification.  </p>

<p>According to a preliminary NYPD investigation, the MAC truck driver, also a 35-year-old male, was attempting to make a right turn eastbound on Tillary when he collided with the cyclist, who was traveling in the same direction. </p>

<p>The driver remained on the scene, and no arrests have been made at this time. An NYPD investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>The intersection of Jay Street and Tillary Street saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030534/https://www.transalt.org/sites/default/files/getinvolved/neighborhood/campaignmaps/Jay_Street_Corridor_Crashes_2002-2011.pdf">41 cyclist or pedestrian-involved crashes </a>between 2002 and 2011, more than any other intersection on the crash-prone roadway. Three cyclists have been injured at the intersection this year to date, according to the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030534/http://www.nycvzv.info/">Vision Zero crash tracker</a>. The Department of Transportation began installing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030534/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bike_lanes_brooklyn.php">protected bike lanes</a> along Jay Street over the summer, though advocates have pointed out that the intersection of Jay and Tillary is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030534/https://twitter.com/2AvSagas/status/785863813325291520">not entirely protected for cyclists</a>. </p>
