<p>Mayor de Blasio wore a bright orange reflective jacket on Tuesday, the second day of spring, to kick off the Department of Transportation&apos;s street redesign construction season. He spoke to reporters near the Tillary Street entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge in Downtown Brooklyn, part of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/brooklynbr_gateway.shtml">multi-million dollar capital project</a> that has benefited from federal funding. Capital projects like this one could face funding gaps under President Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/17/trump_budget_cuts_nyc.php">draft budget</a>. </p>

<p>The estimated $22 million Adams-Tillary entrance, scheduled for completion this summer, received $7 million in Federal Highway formula funds. The redesign plan calls for the widening of the pedestrian-bike entrance, new crosswalks, and a new berm in an area that&apos;s seen 482 traffic injuries, and one fatality, in the last five years. </p>

<p>&quot;Everything we are doing is being threatened by the news we received last week,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;The federal government has supported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://gothamist.com/tags/visionzero">Vision Zero</a> with about $100 million since 2014. That&apos;s a lot of intersections and crosswalks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We need to put a human face on what these cuts mean,&quot; he added. Forty people have died in traffic to date in 2017, according to the city, down from 48 in the same time period last year.</p>

<p>Specifically, the DOT has committed $98.89 million in federal funds to 30 Vision Zero projects since the program&apos;s implementation in 2014, according to the city. Trump&apos;s budget would eliminate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/https://www.transportation.gov/tiger">TIGER</a> (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery), a funding program that DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg said Tuesday has gone toward &quot;our smaller street reconstruction projects&quot; like school safety projects, new street signals, and plaza redesigns. Of the total federal funding for Vision Zero to-date, about $35 million has been TIGER. </p>

<p>De Blasio and Trottenberg both said they would fight any cuts at the federal level and declined to detail how funds might be shifted around if streams dry up. NYC has committed $1.6 billion to Vision Zero to date, for projects over the next five years. According to Trottenberg, there is most uncertainty when it comes to large-scale capital projects, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/current-projects.shtml">Great Streets initiative</a>. The DOT&apos;s 2017-2020 capital plan assumes more than $200 million in federal funds, according to the city. </p>

<p>&quot;We essentially have the resources we need to do operational projects,&quot; Trottenberg said. &quot;It&apos;s a good question about the capital projects.&quot; </p>

Future projects similar to this one could be compromised under Trump&apos;s proposed budget (via DOT). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>For example, one DOT project on the docket this year is the addition of select bus service on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170111/rockaway-beach/rockaway-beach-woodhaven-boulevard-select-bus-service-q52-q53">Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards in Queens</a>: along the Q52 and Q53 lines. The DOT is hoping for an additional $97 million from the feds for &quot;more robust street infrastructure&quot;&#x2014;new medians, some with bus stops, to complement less expensive painted lanes&#x2014;but this has yet to be secured. </p>

<p>Other 2017 plans include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170316/park-slope/new-bike-lanes">safety improvements on Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn</a>, which are still pending input at the community board level. A proposal revealed earlier this month calls for eight miles of protected bike lanes on both sides of the avenue from Dean Street to 65th Street. Great Streets proposals for the Avenue also include elevated medians, larger pedestrian islands, and more trees and street art. The DOT has also proposed bike lane and pedestrian redesign at the Brooklyn entrance to the Williamsburg Bridge, and a similar treatment for the Madison Avenue Bridge entrance in Mott Haven in the Bronx. On Staten Island, five miles of bike lanes are on tap to connect the neighborhoods of Tompkinsville, Stapleton, Concord and Park Hill. </p>

<p>Protected bike lanes are scheduled for completion this spring on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan between 23rd Street and Washington Square Park. Traffic calming is on track for this spring on Broadway between West 155th Street and West 170th Street. A sister project to the Brooklyn Bridge improvements, on the Manhattan side, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/16/park_row_bike_lane.php">in the works for Centre Street</a>. </p>

<p>De Blasio also praised the enforcement side of the Vision Zero equation. Speeding tickets are up 17 percent year-to-date over the same period in 2016; failure to yield tickets are up 29 percent. NYPD Transportation Chief Thomas Chan added that the NYPD has issued 15,497 summonses to drivers blocking bike lanes this year to date&#x2014;a 23 percent increase over last year. </p>

<p>Steve Hindy, an advocate with Families for Safe Streets, told Gothamist that while threats to Federal funding are &quot;very disappointing,&quot; advocates are also gearing up for a fight in Albany. For example, there is currently a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/01/27/cuomo-can-save-lives-by-unshackling-nycs-speed-camera-program/">state-imposed cap</a> on speed camera installation: 140 city-wide, and only in specified locations. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-next-big-vision-zero-victory-is-up-to-governor-cuomo-9612721">According to the DOT</a>, 85 percent of traffic deaths and serious injuries occur at times and locations where cameras are prohibited. </p>

<p>&quot;It just galls me that we have to go to Albany to enable that kind of activity in New York City,&quot; he said. &quot;Once it&apos;s in the purview of the state, then to a certain extent the Upstate and Long Island legislators get their nose into it, and it becomes political football: &apos;Okay so you get that in the city, what are you giving us?&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Speed cameras have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323230119/http://bklyner.com/revenue-camera-enforcement-nyc-sheepshead-bay/">criticized</a> over the years as a revenue generator. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;d be happy to not have that revenue,&quot; de Blasio said Tuesday. &quot;We&apos;d be thrilled if no one sped. The sad thing is that sanctions change behavior.&quot; </p>
