title: Fish Suddenly Died En Masse In Prospect Park Lake This Week 
---

	
										<p>Park-goers who noticed clusters of dead fish along the shoreline of Prospect Park Lake this week were not hallucinating&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130235/https://www.prospectpark.org/">Prospect Park Alliance</a> confirmed Friday that the lake has in fact experienced a &quot;sudden decline in its fish population&quot; over the past few days. </p>

<p>Officials were alerted to the problem Tuesday, and have since blamed a cocktail of unfortunate weather conditions: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130235/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/its_still_hot.php">extreme heat</a> and lack of rain and wind over the past few weeks, which in turn depleted oxygen levels in the lake. </p>

<p>The Alliance is working with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130235/http://www.dec.ny.gov/">New York State Department of Environmental Conservation</a> to investigate further. While there&apos;s no official casualty count, some citizen (and professional) journalists have documented the carnage. </p>

<p>Almost a year ago to the day, there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130235/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/14/more_than_100_fish_dead_and_floatin.php">similar glutting</a> of a carp population at Kissena Lake in Flushing, Queens. An algae bloom following a flash flood reduced oxygen levels in that case, according to the Parks Department.</p>

<p>&quot;They were sticking their mouths out of the water to get more air, which is very rare behavior,&quot; Parks spokesman Sam Biederman told us at the time. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the Department of Environmental Conservation for more detail on their fish-saving tactics. </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 4:00]: </strong> A spokeswoman for the DEC told us that the kill was a &quot;naturally occurring event&quot; caused by &quot;seasonal hypoxia&quot;&#x2014;the official term for low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water. </p>

<p>&quot;This unfortunately occurs frequently in waterbodies throughout the New York City region during this time of year,&quot; she said. &quot;In the case of the Prospect Park lake event, a fish sample has been sent for analysis to confirm the cause of death.&quot; </p>
