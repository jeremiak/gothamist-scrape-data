<p>Police are searching for two men who allegedly broke an angel statue outside of a Williamsburg church on Saturday night. Surveillance footage shows several men climbing on a pedestal supporting an angel statue, alongside a Virgin Mary statue and two other angels. One of the men poses with prayer hands while a second, presumably his buddy, throws down a cigarette and clamors up behind him, knocking the first man and the angel statue to the ground. </p>

<p>Police said that the suspects approached the statue in front of Our Lady of Consolation Catholic Church at 184 Metropolitan Avenue just before midnight on Saturday. A priest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214122532/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/12/13/nypd-men-posing-for-photo-break-church-statue-in-brooklyn/">reportedly alerted</a> cops early Sunday morning. </p>

<p>An NYPD source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214122532/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/vandals-topples-stone-angel-brooklyn-church-article-1.2909122">told the Daily News</a> that the men were &quot;likely intoxicated,&quot; but a spokesman for the department said Tuesday that he couldn&apos;t confirm this, as no arrests have been made and police were not on the scene when the incident occurred. &quot;We don&apos;t know that. The Daily News must have special antennas,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess the assumption that they were drunk was because of the way they [the men] were moving back and forth.&quot;   </p>

<p>This is hardly the first time people have been caught making bad decisions in close proximity to religious statues. (In Williamsburg, no less!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214122532/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/14/yay_williamsburg_so_fun_amazing.php">As recently as September</a>, a man was caught high-fiving, kissing and apparently breaking a statue of Jesus outside the Saints Peter and Paul&apos;s Rectory on South 3rd Street near Berry Street. And in February, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214122532/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/16/brooklyn-church-vandalized/">CBS reported</a> that a teenager had alleged knocked down a guardian angel statue at the <em>very same church</em> where Saturday&apos;s vandals made a mess. At the time, Church pastor Wlodzimierz Las <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214122532/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/vandals-topples-stone-angel-brooklyn-church-article-1.2909122">told the Daily News</a> that the church&apos;s statues had been vandalized at least six times in the last four years. </p>
