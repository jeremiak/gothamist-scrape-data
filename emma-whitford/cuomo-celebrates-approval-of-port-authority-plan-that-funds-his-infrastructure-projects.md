<p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on Thursday approved its largest capital plan to date. Clocking in at $32.2 billion for the years 2017 through 2026, the plan was approved unanimously despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/06/port_authority_spending.php">criticism from New Jersey politicians</a> that it shortchanged critical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/port_authority_bus_terminal.php">bus terminal renovations</a> in favor of governors&apos; pet infrastructure projects, including Governor Andrew Cuomo&apos;s New York-centric <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/laguardia_reboot_ferry.php">LaGuardia</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/cuomo_jfk_airport_overhaul.php">John F. Kennedy Airport</a> renovations.</p>

<p>The plan includes $3.5 billion for the aging bus terminal&#x2014;a project that&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/port_authority_bus_terminal.php">estimated to cost about $10 billion</a>, with some funding expected from local air rights, and the federal government. The investment is expected to help &quot;begin planning and construction,&quot; according to a release from the Authority. </p>

<p>The Port Authority has also allotted about $1.5 billion for Governor Cuomo&apos;s circuitous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/21/cuomos_laguardia_airtrain_will_be_g.php">LaGuardia-Willets Point AirTrain proposal</a>; an already-promised $600 million toward $4.2 billion renovations at LaGuardia Terminals C and D (the rest of the money is expected to come from Delta and other private partners); and $1.7 billion for a Governor Chris Christie-endorsed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=1913">PATH train extension from Downtown Manhattan to Newark Airport</a>. The draft plan also includes about $1 billion to renovate JFK airport&#x2014;a recent proposal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/cuomo_jfk_airport_overhaul.php">heavy on aesthetics and amenities</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;At long last, New York is on its way to having airports worthy of this great state,&quot; Governor Cuomo stated following the vote, calling the plan a &quot;huge step forward for New York and the region.&quot; </p>

<p>An additional $2.7 billion will go towards debt service on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506190832/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/12/hudson_river_tunnel_update.php">construction of a new Gateway rail tunnel under the Hudson River</a>, as the existing tunnel was severely damaged during Hurricane Sandy and has subjected hundreds of thousands of daily commuters to frequent delays. </p>

<p>At a board meeting last month, Port Authority board member Ken Lipper, a Cuomo appointee, described the PATH extension and LaGuardia AirTrain in particular as &quot;amongst the most ill-conceived projects that I&apos;ve experienced in government.&quot; </p>

<p>Port Authority Chairman John Degnan, a Christie appointee and vocal proponent of bus terminal funding, recently called the plan a &quot;compromise,&quot; but admitted that the bus terminal funding would not cover a timely bus terminal renovation. &quot;Do I think it has enough money to erect a new bus terminal in a ten year period?&quot; he said. &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ll see where we&apos;re at in 2027. </p>
