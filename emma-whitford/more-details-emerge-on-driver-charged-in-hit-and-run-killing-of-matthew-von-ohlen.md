<p>Juan Maldonado, the 56-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234901/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/15/von_ohlen_arrest_cyclist.php">charged Tuesday</a> in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234901/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/02/brooklyn_cyclist_fatality.php">July hit-and-run killing</a> of 35-year-old Matthew von Ohlen, worked as a crane operator and lived with his mother in South Williamsburg at the time of his arrest, according to his attorney Howard Kirsch. </p>

<p>&quot;I have almost no information on the case,&quot; Kirsch told Gothamist on Wednesday. &quot;I met him for the first time yesterday and you probably know a lot more than I do at this point.&quot; Kirsch added that he&apos;ll likely meet with his client next week. </p>

<p>Maldonado is being held on $100,00 bail following his indictment on eight counts, including charges of second-degree murder, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash. </p>

<p>Von Ohlen was biking home from a shift as a bartender at Apotheke in Chinatown around 2:20 a.m. on Saturday, July 2nd, when he was struck in front of 690 Grand Street in Williamsburg, between Manhattan and Graham Avenues.  </p>

<p>The Brooklyn District Attorney&apos;s Office said Tuesday that, according to an investigation, Maldonado &quot;swerved&quot; into the bike lane on Grand Street and sped through a red light before striking von Ohlen. He then &quot;hit the victim&apos;s bicycle from behind causing the victim to fall. The defendant continued driving, running over the victim and dragging him approximately 10 to 20 feet as he sped away.&quot;</p>

<p>The charges filed Tuesday, carrying a top sentence of 15 years, imply recklessness&#x2014;not intentionality.</p>

<p>On July 6th, four days after von Ohlen&apos;s death, police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234901/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/07/camaro_hit_run_williamsburg.php">identified the black Chevy Camaro</a> allegedly involved in the crash and confirmed that a suspect had been identified based on the vehicle&apos;s registration. In the months that followed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234901/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/williamsburg_cyclist_death.php">radio silence on the case</a> and a marked uptick in cyclist ticketing on Grand Street angered and puzzled safe streets advocates. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234901/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161115/williamsburg/cyclist-pedestrian-police-arrest-nypd-matthew-von-ohlen-juan-maldonado">DNAinfo reports</a> that the NYPD identified Maldonado when the car was recovered, but waited four months for a grand jury to indict him on felony charges before making an arrest. </p>

<p>The outlet also reports that Maldonado was fired the day before the crash, from a job delivering construction materials for Certified Lumber in South Williamsburg. One employee there said he repeatedly showed up for work under the influence, or didn&apos;t show up at all.</p>

<p>Shortly after the crash, family told DNAinfo, Maldonado drove to Connecticut to visit with his teenage daughter. Police recovered his car there. He apparently didn&apos;t let on about the crash to his mother, who was surprised when officers arrived Tuesday morning to make an arrest. </p>

<p>According to attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234901/http://www.vaccaroandwhite.com/nyc-lawyers-new-york-city-attorneys-protecting-injured-cyclists-pedestrian-victims-adam-white-steve-vaccaro/">Steve Vaccaro</a>, who primarily represents cyclists and pedestrians injured and killed by reckless drivers, it is not uncommon for police to withhold updates on a fatality case. As a general rule of thumb, he said, police will refer to &quot;investigation ongoing,&quot; even if only a shred of evidence is outstanding. &quot;They may have every bit of evidence there is except for one, and they&apos;ll even refuse a FOIL [Freedom of Information Law] request,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234901/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/williamsburg_cyclist_death.php">told us</a>. </p>
