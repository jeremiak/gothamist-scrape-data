<p>Police are looking for three men who allegedly broke the front glass door of a Madison Avenue fur boutique on Christmas Eve morning and proceeded to steal millions of dollars worth of particularly valuable sable fur coats, according to the NYPD and multiple media reports. <br>
 <br>
&quot;They took only the sable coats; they took nothing else,&quot; Dennis Basso, of Dennis Basso at 825 Madison Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108072329/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/26/nyregion/thieves-steal-sable-furs-from-dennis-basso-store.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion">told the New York Times</a>. </p>

<p>The men used a stone to break the shop door shortly before 5:00 a.m. on December 24th, according to an NYPD spokeswoman. They proceeded to steal an &quot;undetermined amount of furs, of unknown value&quot; and flee. No arrests have been made as of Tuesday. According to a NY Times source, the loot was valued in the millions&#x2014;at least 20 coats, some worth as much as $200,000. </p>

<p>&quot;They knew what they were looking for,&quot; Basso <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108072329/http://pagesix.com/2016/12/25/thieves-nab-millions-of-dollars-in-furs-from-dennis-bassos-store/">told Page Six</a>, adding, &quot;It could be the largest fur heist in the city of New York.&quot; </p>

<p>NBC and other outlets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170108072329/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Thieves-Steal-Million-Dollars-Worth-Fur-Coats-Dennis-Basso-Store-Madison-Avenue-Upper-East-Side-408335845.html">obtained surveillance footage</a> of the break-in. In it, one man throws a stone through the door, then pushes through as the glass shatters. A second man follows behind him, and is struck in the head with a metal beam. A third enters behind him. </p>

<p>The sable, known for its dark-brown fur, is a small mammal native to Russia. </p>

<p>&quot;It serves Dennis Basso right for peddling fur stolen from its original owners&quot; said PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman in a statement. </p>

<p>&quot;They are the only victims in this heist,&quot; she added. &quot;PETA is calling on consumers to stop buying and wearing fur. It&apos;s animals who pay a &apos;high price&apos; every time someone buys a fur garment or a coat with fur trim.&quot; </p>
