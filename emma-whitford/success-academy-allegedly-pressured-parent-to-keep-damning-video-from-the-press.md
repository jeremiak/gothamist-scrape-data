<p>At a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/13/success_academy_accuses_ny_times_of.php">press conference on Wall Street</a> this month, Success Academy head Eva Moskowitz dodged a simple question from NY Times reporter Kate Taylor, whose paper had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/today_lesson_fear_shame_dread.php">published a video</a> that day showing a Brooklyn Success Academy teacher excoriating a first grader and ripping up the student&apos;s paperwork. </p>

<p>Was the student still attending Success Academy Cobble Hill? &quot;We&apos;re going to get you that information, we just want to make sure it&apos;s accurate,&quot; Moskowitz said. </p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/nyregion/mother-of-girl-berated-in-video-assails-success-academys-response.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1">the NY Times confirms</a> that the student, whose name has not been revealed, was withdrawn from the school on January 20th by her mother, 23-year-old Nadya Miranda. </p>

<p>In the video that circulated earlier this month, Success Academy Cobble Hill teacher Charlotte Dial yells at Miranda&apos;s daughter for stumbling over a math problem, ripping up the child&apos;s worksheet and banishing her to a &quot;calm down chair,&quot; even though the student appears to be calm. The video was filmed secretly in the fall of 2014 by a concerned assistant teacher. </p>

<p>According to Miranda, Dial apologized to her in January, when the video came to light. However, the parent says Dial never apologized to her daughter. Success Academy denies this, stating that Dial apologized &quot;in real time.&quot; </p>

<p>Miranda also elaborated on her experience with Success Academy leadership and media relations staff over the last few months. In January, she said, Success Academy&apos;s executive VP of public affairs Ann Powell drafted an e-mail for Miranda that asked the NY Times not to publish the video of her daughter, and urged Miranda to send it under her own name. From the Times: </p>

<blockquote>Upset after viewing the video, Ms. Miranda said she did not want it published, to protect her daughter&#x2019;s privacy. Ms. Powell suggested she send an email to The Times. When Ms. Miranda said she did not know what to write, Ms. Powell drafted the email for her and told her to send it from her email address because it would be more powerful coming from her.

<p>On Jan. 20, after the schoolwide meeting with the parents, Ms. Miranda sent another email to The Times saying that she was not happy with how the school was handling the incident and asking to be contacted.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Miranda, who lives in a family shelter with her two children, told the NY Times that her daughter had been placed with Dial for kindergarten and first grade, where she struggled with reading and writing and often felt discouraged. &quot;She used to tell me: &apos;I&apos;m never going to get it. I just don&apos;t know. I&apos;m not as smart as the other kids,&quot; Miranda said, adding, &quot;It makes me feel bad as a parent, like, what am I going to do to build her confidence all over again?&quot;</p>

<p>For her own part, Miranda&apos;s daughter told the Times, &quot;I was scared of Ms. Dial.&quot;</p>

<p>Success Academy, which some parents and politicians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/magazine/the-battle-for-new-york-schools-eva-moskowitz-vs-mayor-bill-de-blasio.html?_r=1">praise</a> for its rigor, student focus, and high test scores, has been challenged by others who say the scores are maintained at the expense of struggling students, some of whom have allegedly been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/30/success_academy_charter.php">disciplined to the point of expulsion</a>. In the wake of the video&apos;s release, several former teachers said that it was common practice at the 36-school charter network to rip up erroneous student work. Moskowitz denounced this allegation, and described the Dial video as an anomaly&#x2014;not the first time the charter school head has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://ny.chalkbeat.org/2015/11/02/watch-success-academy-principal-gives-emotional-apology-for-list-of-got-to-go-students/#.Vs8P6pMrKi5">singled out one teacher</a> in the wake of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/31/eva_moskowitz_charter_schools_got_t.php">unsavory investigative report</a>. </p>

<p>Success Academy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the NY Times said the school declined to comment on the details of Miranda&apos;s decision to withdraw her daughter from the school. Spokesman Stefan Friedman did say that the network was &#x201C;sorry Ms. Miranda chose to withdraw her daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the video&apos;s release, Moskowitz has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017131432/http://www.successacademies.org/site/uploads/2016/02/LettertoAmyVirshup.2.23.16.docx-1.pdf">continued to berate the NY Times</a> for what she perceives to be biased reporting. &quot;I can&apos;t stand by as the New York Times uses selective and &apos;gotcha&apos; tactics,&quot; she told reporters earlier this month. &quot;It is really beyond disappointing that we can&apos;t seem to get a fair shake from the paper of record.&quot;<br>
