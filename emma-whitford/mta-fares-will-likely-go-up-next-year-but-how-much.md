<p>The MTA released a financial plan through 2020 this week, and with it a reminder that bus and subway fares will likely increase in 2017, and again in 2019. Overall, the MTA is planning to generate an extra $308 million annually, next year through to 2020. In a statement Wednesday, the authority said that fares and tolls will increase next year &quot;no more than 4%.&quot; </p>

<p>How these projected fare increases will hit straphanger wallets is less clear. &quot;The MTA said yesterday that it projects at this point that it must increase revenue from fares by 2017&#x2014;as was long announced and previously planned,&quot; said spokeswoman Beth DeFalco on Thursday. &quot;However, we have not projected how that will be done and what fares will look like.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, there&apos;s room for informed speculation. </p>

<p>&quot;Transit is always tricky because there&apos;s a balance between raising the time-based MetroCards&#x2014;the weeklies and monthlies&#x2014;and raising the base fare,&quot; said William Henderson, director of the watchdog group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011148/http://www.pcac.org/">Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA</a>. &quot;They could take the base fare up again, or they could do it by raising weeklies and monthlies, or they could do both.&quot; </p>

<p>In 2015, the MTA took the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011148/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/19/mta_fare_hike_get_it.php">all-out approach</a>: the base fare increased from $2.50 to $2.75. Unlimited 30-day passes jumped from $112 to $116.50, and 7 day passes from $30 to 31. </p>

<p>&quot;The whole fare thing is sort of like the Rubik&apos;s Cube,&quot; Henderson added. &quot;Moving one thing effects the other things.&quot; </p>

<p>This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011148/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-eyeing-2017-bus-subway-fare-hike-3-article-1.2728911">the Daily News</a> talked to the nonprofit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011148/http://www.cbcny.org/">Citizens Budget Commission</a>, which analyzes government finances. The CBC pointed out that if previous fare hikes are an indicator, the single-ride fare might increase to $3. Henderson agreed on Thursday, hedging that the prediction assumes the unlimited MetroCards hold steady. &quot;I think $3 is a viable option if they want to raise fare yields by 4%,&quot; he said. &quot;That would just about do it more or less.&quot;</p>

<p>If the increase only hit the monthly unlimited MetroCards, those fares might increase to just south of $130 per month. There&apos;s a chance it could hit both, to lesser degrees. </p>

<p>Before anything is set in stone, the MTA will take public comment. &quot;In the fall,&quot; the authority stated, &quot;the MTA will present specific proposals for the 2017 all-agency fare and toll increases and will hold a series of public hearings to seek public reactions to the proposals.&quot; </p>

<p>In the meantime, advocates are concerned that Governor Cuomo&apos;s $8.3 billion commitment to the 2015-19 Capital Plan still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011148/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/report_cuomos_budget_punts_on_mta_c.php">lacks</a> a definitive source and specific time frame for payout. (It costs the MTA about $15.6 billion a year to run, about $8 billion of which comes from fares and tolls.) </p>

<p>&quot;We got very specific commitments not merely from the state government, but from the mayor of New York City as well,&quot; countered Cuomo-appointed MTA Board Vice Chairman  Fernando on Wednesday. &quot;Their word is good enough for me.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011148/http://www.ridersny.org/">Riders Alliance</a> Campaign Manager Rebecca Bailin wasn&apos;t assured. &quot;If the state doesn&apos;t put in the money and put in sustainable sources of revenue to fund the MTA, it&apos;s going to come out of riders&apos; pockets,&quot; she predicted. &quot;And on top of that, we&apos;re going to have worse service.&quot; </p>

<p>Bailin added that even small fare increases&#x2014;a 4% hike every two years is roughly apace with inflation&#x2014;can be a burden. &quot;If we have regular fare hikes that are more or less in line with inflation, that&apos;s still going to burden low-income people the most,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>In April, the Riders Alliance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161205011148/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/half_price_metrocards_nyc.php">launched a campaign</a> for half-price MetroCards for the city&apos;s working poor.</p>
