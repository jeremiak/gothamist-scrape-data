<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531235900/http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/visual-arts/art-basel/article48069515.html">According to the Miami Herald</a>, Zhaou was inside the Miami Beach Convention Center, Art Basel&apos;s main exhibition space, when she stabbed a 33-year-old woman in the neck and left shoulder with an X-Acto knife. The assailant and victim later said that they didn&apos;t know each other; Young was transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. </p>

<p>The victim later later told authorities that she had &quot;confronted&quot; Zhaou after the young woman  &quot;purposefully and continuously&quot; followed her around the exhibit&#x2014;&quot;The Swamp of Sagittarius&quot; by artists Naomi Fisher and Agatha Wara. </p>

<p>Zhaou&apos;s affidavit was more colorful: &quot;&#x200B;I had to kill her and two more,&#x201D; she said. &quot;I had to watch her bleed.&quot; She&apos;s since been charged with attempted murder, and is being held on $25,000 bail. </p>

<p>Zhaou had recently finished a five-year architecture program at the University of Oregon, and was starting to think about applying to graduate school, according to Page Six. Friends described her as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531235900/http://pagesix.com/2015/12/07/the-art-basel-stabber-lives-in-new-york/">understanding</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>Her alleged attack last Friday seemed to many attendees, at first, artistic. </p>

<p>&quot;A guy walked up to me and said, &apos;I thought I saw a performance, and I thought it was fake blood, but it was real blood,&apos;&quot; Fisher told the Herald. </p>

<p>Another witness, New York sculptor Gregg Hill, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531235900/http://pagesix.com/2015/12/05/art-basel-stabber-i-had-to-watch-her-bleed/?_ga=1.30029759.1819696953.1423266761">told the Post</a>, &quot;I thought a piece of art fell on her. I never would have thought there would be a stabbing at Art Basel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The attack was an isolated incident that was immediately secured,&quot; &#x200B;Art Basel spokeswoman Sara Fitzmaurice said in a statement. &quot;Our thoughts are with the victim.&quot;<br>
