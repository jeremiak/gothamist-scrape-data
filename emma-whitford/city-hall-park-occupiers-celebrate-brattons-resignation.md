<p>While NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/02/bill_bratton_resigning.php">formally announced his resignation</a> inside City Hall on Tuesday afternoon, a few dozen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/02/bill_bratton_resigning.php">#shutdowncityhall</a> protesters gathered outside on Centre Street against the perimeter fence. Several held up a cloth Black Lives Matter banner, while one protester walked the line with a portable speaker playing N.W.A.&apos;s &quot;Fuck the Police.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, many of these protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/blm_city_hall_occupation.php">began occupying City Hall Park</a> calling for Commissioner Bratton&apos;s resignation. Hundreds had gathered by nightfall, and several returned at 6:00 a.m. for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/02/shut_down_city_hall_nypd.php#photo-1">second day of occupying</a>. In addition to Bratton&apos;s resignation, the group&#x2014;organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925134058/https://www.facebook.com/events/959630214065046/">Millions March NYC</a>&#x2014;is calling for the abolishment of the NYPD, an end to Bratton&apos;s signature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925134058/http://gothamist.com/tags/brokenwindows">Broken Windows method of policing</a>, and reparations for victims of racist policing.</p>

<p>With one demand met after fewer than 48 hours of occupation, the group chanted &quot;Two more to go!&quot; on Tuesday, confirming their resolve to keep occupying until the rest are. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m not ecstatic,&quot; said an occupier who gave his name only as Joel. &quot;I mean, I&apos;m happy that <em>half</em> of one of our demands was met&#x2014;the more cosmetic and symbolic one, that the face of Broken Windows policing has been removed from office.&quot; </p>

<p>By focusing on low-level quality of life issues like excessive noise and public drinking, Bratton has argued, the NYPD can deter more serious crimes like assault and murder. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925134058/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/broken_windows_stats.php">A recent Department of Investigation report cuts against these assumptions</a>, finding no demonstrable link between low-level arrests and felonious crime. Meanwhile, Broken Windows policing is disproportionately applied against African-American and Hispanic New Yorkers. The NYPD has confirmed that Chief of Department James O&apos;Neill will replace Bratton, come September. </p>

<p>&quot;You can always replace a fascist police commissioner with another fascist police commissioner that could possibly, potentially, be worse, you know?&quot; Joel added. &quot;It still leaves the structure, and the systems, and the tactics intact. It&apos;s just changing the face.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, the mood on Tuesday was generally light. &quot;Pinkies up!&quot; shouted occupier Kim Ortiz, as another protester handed out plastic cups of water. &quot;Fuck you William!&quot; The group made a tight circle, cups raised, and toasted the soon-to-be-former Commissioner: &quot;Hasta la vista you motherfucker!&quot; </p>

<p>Earlier, Ortiz recalled reacting to the news of Bratton&apos;s departure in stages. </p>

<p>&quot;When I initially heard it I had to confirm because it was almost unbelievable,&quot; she said. &quot;Then, when confirmed, there was elation. And then after the elation it&apos;s kind of like, alright we still have a lot of work to do. So yeah, great, Bill Bratton&apos;s gone, but we have to see what this new chief is about.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;I absolutely believe that the occupation influenced this decision,&quot; said Millions March organizer Nabil Hassein. &quot;There&apos;s been a lot of work opposing Bill Bratton&apos;s policies. But I do think that this action, gathering hundreds of people, and sending a very clear message right at the Mayor&apos;s doorstep, definitely had an impact.&quot; </p>

<p>Elizabeth Bird, who works near City Hall, passed by just as camera crews began cueing up to film Bratton&apos;s exit from the press conference. Nearby, occupiers pressed towards the fence singing, &quot;Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah, hey hey hey, goooodbye!&quot; </p>

<p>Bird was puzzled about the timing of Bratton&apos;s announcement. &quot;He certainly doesn&apos;t want to make it look like the protesters won,&quot; she said. &quot;But he did.&quot; </p>

<p>#Shutdowncityhall organizers declined to disclose any specific action plans for this evening, but confirmed that they intend to occupy City Hall Park indefinitely. </p>

<p>&quot;I think the most likely outcome [of Bratton&apos;s resignation] is that James O&apos;Neill will continue the same policies of his predecessor and we will continue to be out here,&quot; said Hassein. &quot;In any case we will be out here until all of our demands are met.&quot;</p>
