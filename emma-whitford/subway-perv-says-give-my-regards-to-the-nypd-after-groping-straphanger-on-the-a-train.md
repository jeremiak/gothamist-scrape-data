<p>A man in his 40s allegedly grabbed another man&apos;s butt on the A train on Sunday afternoon and then brazenly told his victim to &quot;give my regards to the NYPD, they know me well,&quot; according to police. The 36-year-old victim was riding the train in Manhattan with his wife and two young daughters when he was groped. </p>

<p>Police said that the forceable touching took place on Sunday afternoon around 4:40 p.m., on a southbound A train pulling into Columbus Circle. While fondling the victim&apos;s butt the groper allegedly announced himself by saying, &quot;Yeah you know you like that. You know what I mean&#x2014;you have a nice soft ass. You know you like that.&quot; </p>

<p>The perv allegedly made his devil-may-care remark about sending his regards after the victim turned to take his picture. </p>

<p>No arrests had been made as of Monday afternoon. The suspect is believed to be partially balding and in his mid 40s&#x2014;about 5&apos;9&quot; and 150 pounds. It was not immediately clear where or when he exited the train. </p>

<p>NYPD Sergeant Paul Grattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105510/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/subway_exposure_nypd.php">told us earlier this summer</a> that the NYPD &quot;doubled down&quot; on its subway sexual assault investigations about a year and a half ago. Cops work with the MTA, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105510/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">created a website</a> for reporting assaults. There&apos;s even an option to upload photos and video. </p>
