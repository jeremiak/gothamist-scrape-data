<p>The country&apos;s first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170522031840/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/27/freelance_protection_nyc.php">freelancer protections against nonpayment</a> go into effect in New York City today, so now&apos;s a good time to brush up on a law intended to help a full third of the city&apos;s workforce get paid on time. </p>

<p>To recap, the law mandates that freelancers be paid in full for work worth $800 or more, either by a date set forward in writing or within 30 days of completing an assigned task. The Freelance Isn&apos;t Free Act also aims to protect freelancers from employer retaliation, and can increase monetary consequences for employers who refuse to pay. We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170522031840/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/04/freelance_isnt_free_nyc.php">broke down the finer details last fall</a>, with insights from the legislation&apos;s author, Brooklyn Councilman Brad Lander, as well as the Freelancers Union, the Department of Consumer Affairs, and attorneys who represent both employers and workers. </p>

<p>&quot;Starting today, New York City will be the first city in the nation to protect freelancers and independent contractors from getting stiffed,&quot; Councilman Lander stated Monday. </p>

<p>A 2015 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170522031840/https://fu-web-storage-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/content/advocacy/uploads/resources/FU_NonpaymentReport_r3.pdf">report</a> from the Freelancers Union found that more than 70 percent of freelancers in New York report problems with receiving payment.  </p>

<p>Within two years of being stiffed, a freelancer can now file a complaint with the city&apos;s Office of Labor Standards, within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The office director will then draft a certified letter to the employer within 20 days, explaining how the freelancer&apos;s contract was allegedly breached. Best case scenario, the law will scare employers straight before a freelancer has to resort to claims court. </p>

<p>But court is still a possibility. And while the new law mandates double damages and attorneys fees if the judge rules in the worker&apos;s favor, the prospect of acquiring an attorney can still be a daunting one for tight-budget freelancers. </p>

<p>In an effort to smooth this road, the Freelancers Union today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170522031840/https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.freelancersunion.org/app&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1494947161143000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbkCZBmnxVKCnTwq-wQSGYXxY0lQ">launched the Freelancers Union App</a> to connect workers with attorneys who both specialize in small claims, and are eager to take on these types of cases. </p>

<p>&quot;We had so many freelancers reaching out to us looking for attorneys that want to represent them, and realized that those can be hard to find,&quot; spokeswoman Caitlin Pearce told Gothamist last week. &quot;And many of our members are attorneys who see this as key to their business.&quot; </p>

<p>The app launches today as a pilot, with about 30 attorneys active in the NYC area, according to Pearce. And while the union isn&apos;t involved in brokering the agreement between attorney and client, in general, they said, attorneys in this field tend to take cases on contingency. They understand that &quot;if you are dealing with freelancers they won&apos;t be able to pay lawyers fees,&quot; Pearce explained (to be clear, assuming you win your case, the court directs the hiring party to pay your lawyer). </p>

<p>The Freelancers Union joined forces with the Department of Consumer Affairs Monday morning to distribute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170522031840/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/workers/workersrights/freelancer-workers.page">informational</a> fliers at eleven transit hubs across the city, according to the DCA. </p>

<p>&quot;Freelancers aren&apos;t free,&quot; Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. &quot;It&apos;s now the law in New York City that they be paid on time, have the written contracts they deserve and have the tools to defend their rights.&quot; </p>
