<p>The majority of police misconduct complaints filed with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/index.page">Civilian Complaint Review Board</a>, an independent city agency that assesses claims of police misconduct, pertain to incidents that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://public.tableau.com/shared/W22X7BQZD?:toolbar=no&amp;:display_count=yes">allegedly took place</a> late on a Friday night or overnight Saturday into early Sunday morning, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative.page">new data visualization</a> published this afternoon. As for the nature of those complaints, new graphs and tables show how many force allegations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://public.tableau.com/shared/W22X7BQZD?:toolbar=no&amp;:display_count=yes">have pertained to a pointed gun</a> versus a chokehold in recent years, and how many offensive language allegations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://public.tableau.com/views/FADOOAllegations/FADOOdash?:embed=y&amp;:toolbar=no&amp;:loadOrderID=7&amp;:display_count=yes">have pertained to race</a> versus gender or sexual orientation. </p>

<p>The CCRB today launched a new website that allows civilians to scroll through dozens of data visualizations of 192,000 police misconduct allegations filed over the last decade. And while some graphs&#x2014;like the one that shows a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative.page">steady decline in CCRB complaints received</a>&#x2014;visualize data that has already been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/21/nypd_misconduct_costs.php">widely reported</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative.page">Data Transparency Initiative (DTI)</a> offers a clearer picture than was previously available of the race, age and gender of New Yorkers filing CCRB complaints, and the nature of said complaints. </p>

<p>One graph (embedded below) shows that more than half of the alleged victims in CCRB complaints are black, and a quarter are Hispanic. Another shows that so far in 2016, 825 black New Yorkers have filed CCRB complaints pertaining to an arrest, compared to 134 white New Yorkers. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for the CCRB said on Tuesday that the maps will be updated regularly, and described them as an improvement over the monthly, semi-annual, and annual reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/issue-based-reports.page">already suppled online</a>. (The CCRB does so-called &quot;issue-based&quot; reports as well&#x2014;most recently on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/05/ccrb_report_lgbtq.php">LGBTQ complainants</a>&#x2014;but historically only once or twice a year.) </p>

<p>The CCRB has also loaded up demographic data on the police officers accused of misconduct: 43% of them have some college study but no degree, it turns out, and 52% of them are white.  </p>

<p>The CCRB also joined Twitter today&#x2014;the organization&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/https://twitter.com/CCRB_NYC/status/780790883268567040">first tweet</a> pertains to the DTI&#x2014;indicating an overall push to get CCRB data circulating on social media (each graph and table in the DTI has an embed function). </p>

<p>The data builds on the CCRB&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/05/nypd_ccrb_map_police.php">existing Complaint Activity Map</a>, which launched in 2014 and shows the total number of complaints per NYPD precinct, filtered by type and by either by month or year, stretching back to 2014. </p>

<p>&quot;I think it&apos;s good to promote transparency within the agency and an ability to be outside of the agency looking in,&quot; an anonymous CCRB investigator told us at the time (he wasn&apos;t authorized to speak on the new mapping tool). &quot;But aggregating all the data, it is not going to tell us what we don&apos;t already know. For example, that the 75th precinct has the most complaints.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;CCRB&apos;s new website provides access to data while being interactive and easy to navigate,&quot;<br>
stated CCRB Chair Maya Wiley on Tuesday. &quot;The new data-driven site enhances transparency and accountability, thereby strengthening public trust.&quot; </p>

<p>If you have thoughts on the depth and breadth of the latest data visualization tools, you can submit them to the CCRB <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170903075953/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative-feedback.page">here</a>. </p>
