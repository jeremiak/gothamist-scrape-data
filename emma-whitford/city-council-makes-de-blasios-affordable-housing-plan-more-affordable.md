<p>The City Council on Monday confirmed that it will approve two major pillars of Mayor de Blasio&apos;s $41 billion affordable housing plan that aims to create and preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing over the next decade.</p>

<p>The Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/03/8593725/city-council-zeroing-final-housing-deal-increase-affordability">agreed to approve</a> the measures with some changes, after a group of affordable housing advocates and unions who were among the plan&apos;s toughest critics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/14/vocal_critics_of_mayors_affordable.php">formally endorsed the mayor&apos;s plan</a>.</p>

<p>The first prong, known as mandatory inclusionary housing (MIH), would require developers to include a portion of below-market-rate units in their new residential projects. </p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s original plan included three options for developers. One called for 25% of units in new developments to be set aside for New Yorkers making 60% of the AMI, or $46,620 for a family of three. Another mandated that 30% of units be affordable for those making 80% of the AMI, or $62,150 for a family of three. The third laid out 30% affordability at 120% of the AMI, without government subsidies. </p>

<p>Critics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/affordable_housing_battle.php">had argued</a> that the rezoning would produce a glut of new apartments too expensive for long-time residents of these neighborhoods. For example, only 13% of the apartments planned for East New York would be affordable to the 53% of current residents who make less than $35,000 a year. As-written, the plan has been formally rejected <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/manhattan_affordable_housing.php">by 50 of 59 impacted community boards</a>, and four of the five borough presidents.</p>

<p>The City Council added a fourth option to the plan this week&#x2014;20% of units affordable for New Yorkers who make 40% of the AMI, or roughly $31,000 a year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/nyregion/housing-plan-gains-new-york-councils-backing-with-expanded-affordability-rules.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">The Times reports</a> that the amended plan also lowers the affordability cap from 120% to 115% of the AMI, about $89,000 for a family of three. </p>

<p>&quot;We changed the affordability at both ends,&quot; Brooklyn Councilmember David Greenfield told the paper. The levels of affordability for each new construction project will be determined on a case-by-case basis by local councilmembers. </p>

<p>Alterations to the Mayor&apos;s zoning for quality and affordability (ZQA) plan&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/de_blasio_zoning_affordable.php">originally</a> called for the elimination of parking requirements at new developments within a half mile of a subway stop&#x2014;has also been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160314/civic-center/city-council-backs-de-blasios-controversial-rezoning-plans-after-changes">altered</a> to appease residents in the outer boroughs.</p>

<p>While Mayor de Blasio called the Council&apos;s approval a &quot;watershed moment,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926042254/http://www.anhd.org/">Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development</a> offered more tempered praise. </p>

<p>&quot;The announced deal will make sure that MIH serves an additional 15% of New York City&apos;s households&#x2014;close to half a million families&#x2014;that would have been left out,&quot; the group stated. &quot;[But] almost 30% of our City&apos;s households fall below 30% of AMI, and will not be served by the MIH program.&quot;</p>

<p>The revisions to de Blasio&apos;s plan are expected to be approved during the next full City Council session on March 22nd. </p>
