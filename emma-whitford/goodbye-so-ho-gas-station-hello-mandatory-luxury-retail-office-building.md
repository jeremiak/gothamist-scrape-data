<p>For every <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/">Vanishing New York</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/28/then_now_photos_show_our_changing_s.php#photo-1">diehard</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/photo_mars_bars.php">mourner of drowned dive bars</a>, there&apos;s an icy horizon-gazer who cheers every time a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/04/hell_phone_bushwick.php#photo-1">phone booth</a> is replaced with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/nyc_free_wifi_test.php">WiFi charging station</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="052716_Soho3.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/052716_Soho3.jpeg" width="320" height="367"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block">(Cookfox)</i></div> The latter probably won&apos;t take issue with the luxury mini-mall and office building that is now poised to replace the old BP Station on Houston Street that for decades has welcomed straphangers out of the subway at Broadway-Lafayette. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/soon_there_may_be_nowhere_to_fill_u.php">We&apos;ve known for a while</a> that this day was probably coming, that BP would go the way of the gas stations on Bowery and Bond, Bowery and Third, Bowery and Fourth and Houston and Broadway&#x2014;now a loft, the Bowery Hotel, BBar, and an Adidas store respectively. <p></p>

<p>But now the lot&apos;s future is coming into view, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://largavista.com/properties/300-lafayette/">the renderings</a> are about as expensive and bland-looking as you would expect. </p>

<p>The glassy, 80,000 square foot mixed-use building will be planted with lots of &quot;indigenous&quot; plant species because, as the developers point out, &quot;People feel good when they are connected to nature.&quot; It will also have an outdoor terrace that people who are employed by companies that can afford luxury office space will enjoy: </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="052716_Soho2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/052716_Soho2.jpeg" width="640" height="393"> <br> <i>(Cookfox)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>And because we just can&apos;t get enough mixed-use office space, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://www.wsj.com/articles/soho-project-gets-financing-1464224244?cb=logged0.6387880297843367">reports</a> that Madison Capital and Vornado Realty Trust just closed on neighboring 606 Broadway last week&#x2014;the one-time home, as EV Grieve points out, of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031061158/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2014/11/honest-boy-fruit-stand.html">Honest Boy Fruit Stand</a>&#x2014;for $25.8 million. </p>

<p>&quot;There are many imitators but there is really one SoHo,&quot; Madison partner Richard Wagman told WSJ, celebrating his purchase, which is located steps from such distinctive SoHo icons as Crate &amp; Barrel, Chase Bank, Chipotle, and Best Buy. </p>

<p>The gas station transformation will reportedly be complete by 2018, during which time we&apos;ll all probably start feeling nostalgic for gas stations. </p>
