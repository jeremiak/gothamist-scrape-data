<p>Mayor de Blasio, who has recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215841/https://twitter.com/nahmias/status/871872788696629248">prickled</a> at the public&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215841/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/02/hey_mr_mayor_take_the_subway.php">renewed interest</a> in his SUV-dependent Park Slope YMCA habit, tried to commiserate with straphangers during an unrelated press conference on Thursday, reminiscing about commuting regularly underground in the 1990s. He also pledged to &quot;put forward a vision&quot; to shift the MTA&apos;s focus towards general subway maintenance, somehow exacting more influence on the MTA Board, the majority of which is appointed by Governor Cuomo. </p>

<p>&quot;I rode the F train for many, many years... in fact, from &apos;92 to &apos;99 it was the only way I got around. Or also the R train sometimes because those were the two that go near my house in Brooklyn, and I didn&apos;t have a car into well into 1999,&quot; the Mayor said, adding, &quot;I can absolutely relate to what people must have gone through [during] that horrible incident. We need to demand a plan of action immediately.&quot; </p>

<p>Acknowledging the Governor&apos;s influence over the MTA, de Blasio pledged to present a new list of priorities. </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA historically has not focused enough of its energies on the New York City subway system, even though by far it&apos;s the number one thing the MTA does&#x2014;five to six million riders a day,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;So I will be speaking about this regularly. And if we don&apos;t see a plan, we&apos;ll put forward a vision through my representatives on the MTA of what needs to change.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I think credible ideas from any source can help push the conversation in that direction,&quot; said John Raskin of the Riders Alliance. </p>

<p>&quot;The more people that focus on the condition of the subways, the better it is for the riding public,&quot; Albert agreed. However, he added, &quot;The governor has so many more appointees than the mayor to the board that it&apos;s clear who&apos;s in control.&quot; The subway has been under state control since the late 1960s; Governor Cuomo appoints six members to the 14-member board. </p>

<p>&quot;Some of the things that <em>are</em> in the mayor&apos;s power are to have the city pay for fair fares, and providing more money to the MTA&apos;s capital plan and operations,&quot; Albert said. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the governor told Gothamist that the mayor&apos;s best bet would be to provide more capital and operating funds (responsibility for the subway has been a favorite sparring topic for two public officials who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215841/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/16/cuomo_cares_no_really.php">like to spar</a>). </p>

<p>&quot;When someone says it&apos;s not about the money that means it is about the money,&quot; Dani Lever said. &quot;The best way the mayor could help is by paying his fair share of capital and operating expenses&#x2014;that would directly improve service for riders.&quot; </p>

<p>The MTA&apos;s 2015-19 capital plan includes New York City&apos;s largest commitment to date, totaling $2.5 billion&#x2014;an amount de Blasio&apos;s staff has repeatedly described as unprecedented. New York City&apos;s latest budget, signed earlier this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215841/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/07/fair_fare_nyc_metrocard.php">does not include</a> $50 million to pilot reduced MetroCard fares for the working poor. In the lead-up to the final budget, Mayor de Blasio said that NYC could not afford the program.  </p>

<p>It&apos;s important to note that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215841/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-losing-money-headed-financial-ruin-article-1.2202720">roughly half</a> of the MTA&apos;s operating budget comes from fares paid by daily riders like the ones trapped on the F train from hell earlier this week. The MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215841/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/25/mta_debt_expansion.php">recently voted</a> to increase its overall debt by $5 billion over the next several years, in large part to fund new infrastructure projects. Board members cautioned last month that said debt will increase upward pressure on fares&#x2014;if not this year, then years down the road. </p>
