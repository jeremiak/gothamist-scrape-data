<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="ironunionlogo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230165251im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/ironunionlogo.jpg" width="300" height="289" class="image-right"> </span>On the second Sunday of every month, Greenpoint dad and producer James Hook hosts a meeting of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230165251/http://www.brooklynironersunion.org/">Brooklyn Ironers&apos; Union Local 278</a> in the basement of The Diamond, a bar on Franklin Street. The &quot;union&quot; is Hook&apos;s invention: a small gathering of &quot;journeyman-level ironers,&quot; like himself. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s an actual thing,&quot; Hook said on Tuesday. &quot;We have buttons and we have patches.&quot; </p>

<p>Hook already has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230165251/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/25/24-bar-ironing-petes-2016-06-17-bk.html">a reputation</a> for ironing strangers&apos; clothing&#x2014;for free&#x2014;inside Pete&apos;s Candy Store in Williamsburg. &quot;I realized that there was this very mutually beneficial system whereby people who love ironing can go to a bar and do something they love,&quot; he told Gothamist. &quot;The bar gets a good service, sometimes the bar will give [the ironer] a free beer, and the public gets their clothes ironed.&quot; </p>

<p>To further test his hunch, Hook and a small handful of union members will be hosting free ironing sessions on Tuesdays in January, from 9 p.m. to midnight, at different bars in Brooklyn. The ironers will be at The Diamond on January 3rd, Pete&apos;s Candy Store on the 10th, a to-be-determined bar on the 17th, Le Gamin Cafe on the 24th, and Troost on the 31st. </p>

<p>Tricky items like silk pleated skirts aren&apos;t a guarantee, but basic cotton shirts and pants are standard. </p>

<p>Hook, who also goes by &quot;Iron Man&quot; (&quot;James Hook&quot; is an ironing nom de plume as well, go figure), hopes to destigmatize ironing as a chore, he said, while making it accessible to all&#x2014;not just a luxury for those with enough time and resources. &quot;I will start in my home neighborhood, and I hope it will transition from a private chore to a public benefit,&quot; he said. &quot;I will see how far I can take this idea.&quot; </p>

<p>With the union, he added, bar patrons can expect a certain level of competency. &quot;If a bar is accepting a public ironer, they will have a basic level of skill,&quot; he promised. &quot;You also have to have your own board, like any union [member] has the tools of the trade. You need to have a little lamp, too, because bars are dark.&quot; </p>

<p>Hook offered a similar month of service over the summer, but said there&apos;s something particularly comforting&#x2014;and sexy&#x2014;about fresh ironing in the winter. </p>

<p>&quot;One of the best feelings in the world, when it&apos;s cold, is to put on clothes that are smooth and warm and fresh,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s sensual.&quot; </p>

<p>For an extra-sensory experience, Hook suggests bringing your own headphones and a splitter. (He often listens to music while ironing to drown out the bar music and conversation.) </p>

<p>&quot;You can listen to music alone with the ironer which is a sensual pleasure,&quot; Hook said. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230165251/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/crg/5903155831.html">interested in joining Hook&apos;s ranks</a>, the next union meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m. on January 8th, at The Diamond at 43 Franklin Street. &quot;Right now no dues, and everyone is welcome,&quot; Hook said. &quot;You just have to be serious about ironing.&quot; The less ambitious can catch his tour.</p>
