<p>Every once in a while, a member of the Park Slope Food Coop snaps a picture of a few paragraphs in the print edition of the internally-circulated <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319201247/https://www.foodcoop.com/LWGTOC">Linewaiters&apos; Gazette</a></em>, and posts it on social media as a public service.</p>

<p>There was the episode with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319201247/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/park_slope_coop_obits.php">food coop&apos;s official obituary writer</a>, and the police blotter-esque account of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319201247/https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gothamist+park+slop+food+coop+burglers&amp;*">organic grocery thieves</a>. Today, we bring you a debate that&apos;s been knocking around in the paper&apos;s Letters To the Editor section since December: What if coop members were required to refer to each other as comrades? How about &apos;phrens&apos;? More importantly: are they trolling us? </p>

<p>Coop member Mike Epstein posted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319201247/https://www.instagram.com/p/BRvXtMPBvbI/">latest installment of this debate</a> on Instagram today, from the February 16th issue. It begins, in the left column, with &apos;GREETINGS PHRENS&apos;:</p>

<p>&quot;I would like to take issue with Benedicte Charpentie&apos;s suggestion that we replace the   gender-normative addresses &apos;sir&apos; and &apos;ma&apos;am&apos; with  the allegedly Marxist term &apos;comrade,&apos;&quot; writes member Robert Berkman. &quot;Anybody who is even casually conversant with Karl Marx&apos;s writings would know that he specifically rejected the use of &apos;comrade&apos; to refer to fellow members of the impending socialist revolution.&quot; </p>

<p>Berkman goes on to reference a Marx &quot;text&quot; that is titled something along the lines of &quot;The Secrets Is For Me Not Vegetables,&quot; according to our cursory Google Translate research. Things devolve from there. As our tipster noted, the German quote &quot;appears to be a parody of funny german words, like Lederhosen and Hauptbahnhof (central train station).&quot; Not, as Berkman suggests, &quot;a clear preference for non-gender hierarchal forms of addressing one&apos;s  peers.&quot; </p>

<p>Berkman&apos;s alternative pronoun suggestion is &quot;phren,&quot; because, of course, it &quot;bears some homophonic similarities to &apos;friend,&apos; but shortens it to maintain an aura of unfamiliarity, while leaving open the possibility of future comradery.&quot; </p>

<p>Taking things back a few steps, the whole debate originated in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319201247/https://www.foodcoop.com/files_lwg/lwg_2016_12_22_vKK_n26.pdf"><em>another</em> letter</a> Berkman sent to the editor in the December 22nd issue, in which he expressed displeasure at being called &quot;sir&quot; by another coop member (he had apparently complained to that member about a stack of cream cheese containers that were &quot;filled less than halfway.&quot;) </p>

<p>&quot;This policy of addressing outwardly male Coop members as &apos;sir&apos; is an issue that I intend to bring up at a future General Meeting, by the way,&quot; he noted ominously. </p>

<p>Charpentie responded in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319201247/https://www.foodcoop.com/files_lwg/lwg_2017_01_19_vLL_n01.pdf">next issue</a>: &quot;Lets declare, as a policy, that from now on all Coop members will address each other as &apos;Comrade,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;It is completely gender neutral, and would also give a romantic whiff of Marxism to any interaction.&quot; And... here we are, back at &quot;phrens.&quot; </p>

<p>We couldn&apos;t immediately reach Berkman or Charpentier on Friday, so we can&apos;t confirm where any of these letters land on the serious/satire spectrum. That said, multiple Coop members assured us that the debate has not been raging in the aisles. </p>

<p>&quot;I think it&apos;s just a back-and-forth in the letter section,&quot; said a woman who answered the Coop general line on Friday, but declined to give her name. &quot;A lot happens in the Linewaiters&apos; Gazette that doesn&apos;t come to anything.&quot; </p>

<p>The woman agreed to connect us with General Manager Joseph Holtz, who had even less patience. &quot;I think our members are thinking about this close to zero,&quot; he told Gothamist. &quot;And if you want to know how much I&apos;m thinking about it, it&apos;s even closer to zero. It just doesn&apos;t grab me as being very important to the stewardship of the food coop.&quot; Okay phrendo. </p>

<p>We&apos;ll update if we hear back from Berkman. In the meantime, the joke&apos;s probably on us. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Berkman confirmed that he was trolling. &quot;I&apos;m a Coop crank,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve been there for almost 30 years and I&apos;ll do whatever I can to make myself a pain in the ass.&quot; </p>
