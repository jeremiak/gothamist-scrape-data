<p>Brooklyn rapper Troy Ave was shot multiple times on Christmas Day while driving his red Maserati in Brownsville, according to the NYPD and multiple media reports. The 34-year-old, given name Roland Collins, took private transportation to the hospital&#x2014;where he later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/https://www.instagram.com/p/BOd3WUAAIFR/">posed for a hospital bed picture</a> with rapper 50 Cent. </p>

<p>Collins had been en route to visit family for the holiday when shots broke out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/http://abc7ny.com/news/rapper-troy-ave-shot-while-on-way-to-see-family-in-brooklyn-for-christmas/1672935/">according to ABC</a>. </p>

<p>The musician is currently facing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/31/troy_ave_arraignment.php">attempted murder</a> and criminal weapon possession charges for his alleged involvement in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/26/irving_plaza_shooting_nyc.php">shooting</a> during a T.I. concert at Irving Plaza this spring. As of Monday, there is no apparent connection between the Christmas shooting, and the May incident. </p>

<p>An NYPD spokeswoman said Collins was inside his car around 4:20 p.m. on Sunday at the intersection of East 91st Street and Linden Boulevard when he was approached by an unknown shooter. Collins was shot in the arm and grazed in the head, according to police. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161226/brownsville/rapper-troy-ave-shot-brooklyn-on-christmas-police-say">DNAInfo reports</a> that there was a 29-year-old woman in the car as well. The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rapper-troy-ave-survives-brooklyn-shooting-christmas-article-1.2923688">identified </a>the woman as Collins&apos;s girlfriend. </p>

<p>&quot;He looked to his left. He saw that the guy had a gun and was about to fire, and he started driving away,&quot; one of Collins&apos;s attorneys, John Stella, told the tabloid. &quot;He continued driving and he reached the point where he was bleeding pretty profusely, and apparently a good Samaritan drove him and his girl a couple of blocks the rest of the way to Brookdale [Hospital].&quot;</p>

<p>Police did not have a description of the suspect. No arrests have been made, and an investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>Collins was shot in the leg during the Irving Plaza shooting, which left his bodyguard and friend Ronald McPhatter dead. At least five shots were fired over the course of several minutes during an opening set for the May 25th concert; McPhatter was fatally shot in the stomach.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/26/police_arrest_one_for_irving_plaza.php">Security camera footage</a> obtained from the venue shows a suspect, apparently Collins, firing shots inside Irving Plaza that night, and prosecutors say three guns, including one that matched the gun that shot McPhatter, were recovered from the car that drove Collins to the hospital.</p>

<p>Collins&apos;s lawyers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155503/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/08/troy_ave_sues_irving_plaza.php">since sued the venue</a>, alleging that security guards failed to do adequate weapons checks at the door. They say their client fired in self-defense, and that another shooter killed McPhatter. </p>

<p>Scott Leemon, another attorney for Collins, could not immediately be reached for comment on the Christmas shooting. &quot;Tonight, Troy Ave was targeted again, on Christmas,&quot; Leemon told DNAInfo on Sunday. &quot;In Brooklyn, going to meet his family for the holiday, he was shot two times. Thankfully, he will survive the second attempt on his life.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>[Correction 12/27]:</strong> An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Collins is charged with murder. He is in fact charged with attempted murder, as well as criminal weapon possession. </p>
