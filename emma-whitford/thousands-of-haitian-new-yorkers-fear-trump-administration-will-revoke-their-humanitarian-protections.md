<p>When she&apos;s not taking classes towards her nursing license at Hostos Community College, Roseny Mompoint, 41, works as a home health aid. A native of Haiti, Mompoint can legally work in the United States thanks to her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021230252/https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status#What%20is%20TPS?">Temporary Protected Status (TPS)</a>, a protection against removal for non-citizens who face danger in their countries of origin, from war to natural disasters and epidemics. The right to work is crucial, she says, since her status bars her from financial aid. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s helped me get a job and I can afford to [got to school], even though I take the classes slowly,&quot; Mompoint, who lives in Brooklyn, told Gothamist this week. &quot;But I can pay to go to school, and still eat something, and pay bills.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was in the shadows, and now I&apos;m living like a normal American,&quot; she added.</p>

<p>The humanitarian protection is back in the spotlight this spring, as Haiti&apos;s status is up for renewal in late May ahead of a possible July 22nd expiration. </p>

<p>Haiti was awarded TPS under President Barak Obama in 2010, after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021230252/https://www.rescue.org/article/earthquake-haiti">massive earthquake</a> struck near the capital city of Port-au-Prince, killing 300,000 people and leaving 2.3 million more homeless. It was renewed most recently in 2016, following Hurricane Matthew. Roughly 55,000 Haitians are currently living in the US with TPS, which comes with travel authorization as well as employment authorization and protection from deportation. More than 20,000 live in NYC alone, according to 1199SEIU, a service workers union that represents thousands of health aids, many of them Haitian, like Mompoint. </p>

<p>While advocates and legal service providers argue that conditions in the island nation are dire&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021230252/http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article147281679.html">recent cholera outbreak</a> had killed 9,300 people and sickened 790,840 more as of last August&#x2014;the fate of Haitian TPS appears to be an open question under President Donald Trump. </p>

<p>&quot;The conditions have not changed,&quot; said Irina Matiychenko, director of the Immigrant Protection Unit with the New York Legal Assistance Group, which has represented Haitian New Yorkers seeking humanitarian protections since 2010. &quot;What&apos;s changed is political climate here.&quot; </p>

<p>Federal head of Citizenship and Immigration Services James McCament <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021230252/http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article146104144.ece/binary/End-of-TPS-recommendation.pdf">recommended</a> that the US withdraw TPS for Haitians in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last month, writing that, &quot;over all, circumstances in the country have continued on an upward trajectory since the 2010 earthquake.&quot; And this month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021230252/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/05/09/us/politics/ap-us-immigration-protection-haiti.html?_r=0">the Associated Press acquired emails</a> between top immigration officials seeking crime data for Haitians benefiting from the program.</p>

<p>&quot;Secretary Kelly hasn&apos;t made a decision on TPS for Haiti,&quot; DHS spokeswoman Joanne Talbot told Gothamist in a statement. &quot;The Secretary&#x2019;s decision will be based on a thorough assessment of the conditions in the country; separately, he has asked the staff for detailed information to increase his understanding of how the program operates.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="051717_WestIndianDayParade.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021230252im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/051717_WestIndianDayParade.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Revelers with Haitian flags at the West Indian Day Parade on Eastern Parkway last September.

<p>&quot;The country is one of the poorest in the world,&quot; Matiychenko said of Haiti. &quot;People don&apos;t want to go home. Not because they don&apos;t like their country, but they don&apos;t know what to expect. Average income for a Haitian family is $3 per day. So it&apos;s no infrastructure, it&apos;s no medicine, it&apos;s not enough food, and people are literally living on the street. In addition to the epidemic.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The folks who are living here [in New York] are working to support their family and support Haitians,&quot; she added. &quot;And by doing this they help build infrastructure in Haiti.&quot; </p>

<p>Matiychenko predicted that the revocation of TPS would not result in a mass exodus back to Haiti. After two years in the US, Haitians have due process rights. </p>

<p>&quot;If TPS is terminated it means that these people are losing their status and they will lose employment authorization,&quot; she said. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t mean that all of these folks the next day would go home to Haiti. Of course they don&apos;t want to do it. In order to force them to go Immigration Enforcement has to bring them all to immigration court. It would be very expensive.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re not expecting mass deportations,&quot; echoed Nisha Agarwal, Commissioner of the Mayor&apos;s Office of Immigrant Affairs. &quot;But I think it would make people&apos;s lives very challenging.&quot; </p>

<p>Today, City Hall staff and volunteers handed out flyers detailing TPS revocation consequences at MTA stations in Brooklyn and Queens. Mayor de Blasio also cosigned a letter to Secretary Kelly, calling on DHS to renew TPS for Haitians. The letter is signed by fourteen mayors who represent large Haitian populations, from Boston and Philadelphia to Miami. </p>

<p>&quot;Our Haitian immigrant residents work, pay taxes, and contribute to our cities every day,&quot; the letter states. &quot;They are ingrained in every aspect of our cities as they own small businesses, serve in our governments, and work in our hospitals and schools.&quot; </p>

<p>About 125,000 New Yorkers are part of the Haitian diaspora, according to the Mayor&apos;s Office. A recent Legal Resources Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021230252/https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/2017-04-18_economic_contributions_by_salvadoran_honduran_and_haitian_tps_holders.pdf">report</a> predicted that terminating TPS would result in a $2.8 billion reduction in US GDP over a decade, as well as $428 million in lost Social Security and Medicare contributions nation wide. </p>

<p>Roseny said that her primary concern is continuing to work, in order to support her nursing classes. With resources so tight, she hasn&apos;t had the time or money to begin the green card application process, she added. </p>

<p>&quot;I would like for President Trump to still be able to understand the way people are living,&quot; she said. &quot;We left our country to come here, because if it was safe for us we wouldn&apos;t come here to find a better place to stay or a better life. We came here to contribute to American society, and we didn&apos;t do anything. We go by the rules. So I think if he has a heart he has to help us.&quot; </p>

<p>Agarwal said that City Hall is aware of several other TPS renewals coming up this year and next, including those for El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal and Yemen. &quot;We will be keeping a close eye on what happens,&quot; she said. &quot;What happens with Haiti may be a signal of what happens later.&quot; </p>
