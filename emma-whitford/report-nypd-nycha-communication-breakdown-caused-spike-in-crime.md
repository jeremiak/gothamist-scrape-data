<p>For years the NYPD has failed to communicate with the New York City Housing Authority about all arrests on public housing property&#x2014;as well as arrests of public housing residents&#x2014;despite the fact that communication of such information has been required since the late 1960s, according to a report [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095310/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doi/downloads/pdf/2015/Dec15/pr41nycha_nypd_mou_120815.pdf">PDF</a>] released this week by the Department of Investigation. </p>

<p>The report suggests that this &quot;systemic failure&quot; in communication has boosted the disproportionately high crime rates on NYCHA properties versus the rest of the city. </p>

<p>While about 5% of NYC residents live in public housing, 15% of homicides, 11% of rapes, and 10% of felony assaults in the city take place on the premises, the report found. </p>

<p>In order to conduct its investigation, the DOI reviewed more than 1,300 arrest reports pertaining to NYCHA properties or residents over the course of March 2015. The &quot;great majority&quot; of these arrests involved possession of small amounts of marijuana or other drugs, trespassing, and domestic violence.</p>

<p>Twenty seven of the 1,000+ arrests were for violent and drug-related crimes that, according to the NYPD&apos;s patrol guide, must be reported to NYCHA. The DOI found that 9 of these incidents were never reported. </p>

<p>Among those arrests were a resident arrested in front of the Mitchell Houses in the Bronx with a loaded pistol, a resident who allegedly threatened a neighbor with a machete, and a resident who allegedly attempted to rape the complainant inside of a NYCHA apartment.  </p>

<p>Once NYCHA is informed of a resident arrested for an alleged violent or drug-related crime, the authority has the right to remove that individual from the premises using its discretion. A process called &quot;Permanent Exclusion&quot; allows NYCHA to evict individual residents who endanger &quot;their neighbors&apos; safety or peaceful tenancy.&quot;</p>

<p>Enforcement of permanent exclusion is &quot;essentially toothless,&quot; the report charges, accusing NYCHA of letting criminal offenders remain in their housing without consequences.</p>

<p>In response to the report, NYCHA spokesman David Farber <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095310/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/nyregion/report-details-systemic-failures-in-communication-between-police-and-housing-authority.html?ref=nyregion">said in a statement to the NY Times</a> that &quot;NYCHA is not expanding the criteria for eviction or exclusion; rather, the authority is working with the NYPD to sharpen its policy so it moves more quickly to exclude or evict from NYCHA individuals who commit very serious offenses.&quot;  </p>

<p>Robert Gangi, Director of the Police Reform Organizing Project, questioned the fairness of basing the dangerousness of an individual primarily off of an arrest, which precedes any proof of guilt. </p>

<p>&quot;How do you determine who a &apos;thug&apos; is? Is it based on the arrest?&quot; he said. &quot;Being arrested isn&apos;t a sure sign of that you&apos;re dangerous or predatory person. The NYPD makes so many frivolous arrests, primarily of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315095310/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/26/de_blasios_bail_reform.php">people of color</a>, who mainly occupy public housing. There should be a system to assess the dangerousness of an individual on a case-by-case basis.&quot; </p>
