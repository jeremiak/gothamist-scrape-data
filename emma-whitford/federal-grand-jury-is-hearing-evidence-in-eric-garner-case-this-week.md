<p>A federal grand jury convened in Brooklyn on Wednesday to begin hearing evidence in the death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who was put into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917130449/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">fatal chokehold</a> by NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo outside of a deli in the summer of 2014. </p>

<p>Officers approached Garner that day after the deli owner complained that he was allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes. The fatal arrest was captured on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917130449/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/10/donovan_staten_island_republicans.php">cellphone video</a>, and immediately gained national attention. The medical examiner later determined that Pantaelo&apos;s chokehold&#x2014;which goes against NYPD protocol&#x2014;factored in Garner&apos;s death. In order to indict Pantaleo, prosecutors must show the grand jury that the officer willfully deprived Garner of his civil right to not undergo an &quot;unreasonable&quot; search. There is no guarantee that these proceedings will result in federal charges against the officer. </p>

<p>The federal grand jury is convening more than a year after Pantaleo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917130449/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/eric_garner_grand_jury.php">escaped prosecution by a grand jury</a> at the state level. The no-indictment ruling prompted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917130449/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/04/eric_garner_chokehold_protest.php#photo-1">large protests</a> in NYC and across the country and an internal NYPD review, which is ongoing. </p>

<p>A federal civil rights investigation into Garner&apos;s death was also launched&#x2014;this month&apos;s grand jury marks its conclusion. </p>

<p>Two NYPD officers who were present during the fatal arrest testified before the federal grand jury on Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917130449/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/feds-case-cops-involved-eric-garner-death-article-1.2527515">as first reported</a> by the Daily News. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917130449/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/nyregion/federal-grand-jury-begins-hearing-evidence-in-eric-garner-case.html?_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, Pantaleo will not testify. Instead, the federal grand jury will consider the testimony that Pantaleo gave before the Staten Island grand jury back in 2014. </p>

<p>News of this week&apos;s federal proceedings came as a surprise to many, including Garner&apos;s widow, Esaw.  &#x201C;I appreciate the news, but no comment,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917130449/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/feds-case-cops-involved-eric-garner-death-article-1.2527515">said</a>. </p>
