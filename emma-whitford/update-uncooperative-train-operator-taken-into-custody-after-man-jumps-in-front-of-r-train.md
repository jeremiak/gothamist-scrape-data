<p>The MTA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092927/http://www.mta.info/status/subway/NQR/24470798">MTA.info suggests</a> that Bay Ridge and Sunset Park commuters use the B37 or B63 bus as an alternative until further notice. </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 1:00 p.m.]:</strong> The victim jumped in front of the oncoming R train, according to a spokeswoman for the MTA. The authority also confirmed that an MTA employee on the scene was uncooperative when asked for a statement by the police, and was taken into custody. </p>

<p>Pete Donohue, spokesman for the Transport Workers Union Local 100, said that the employee in question was a train operator, and would have been positioned in the very front of the train when the victim allegedly jumped. </p>

<p>The NYPD confirmed Monday that an MTA worker was taken into custody at the scene this morning, and brought to Lutheran Hospital for an evaluation. </p>
