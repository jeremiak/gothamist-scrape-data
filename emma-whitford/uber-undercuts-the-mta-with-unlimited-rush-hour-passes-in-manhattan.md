<p>It&apos;s hard to believe that this time last year, the City Council was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/01/uber_is_furious_that_the_city_counc.php">on the verge of regulating</a> Uber, pushing legislation that would have temporarily capped expansion of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation">$62.5 billion-valued</a> ride-share app within New York City. After a few cautionary statements about the possibility of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/20/uber_deblasio_nyc.php">Uber &quot;flood,&quot;</a> Mayor de Blasio about-faced and scrapped the cap in favor of a study on the industry&apos;s impact&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/15/uber_report_nyc.php">far-from-damning results</a> of which were released quietly on a Friday afternoon in January. The app <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/29/uber_nyc_cheaper.php">slashed its Uber X fares by 15%</a> around that time, and this week Uber is launching a fresh, large-scale, unhindered NYC expansion plan: two, four and eight-week unlimited passes for weekday rush-hour rides below 125th Street that cost significantly less than a MetroCard. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the breakdown: starting at 4:30 today, Uber will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/https://www.giltcity.com/newyork/uberpresalejuly16">unleash a Gilt City promotion</a> for unlimited weekday UberPool rides below 125th Street (meaning, you share your Uber with strangers) between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., and 5:00 p.m and 8:00 p.m. The so-called &quot;Uber Commute Card&quot; costs $49 for two weeks, $79 for four weeks, and $159 for eight weeks. An Uber spokesman said Tuesday that the promotion will accommodate &quot;thousands&quot; of app users, and that the clock starts ticking with your first trip, just like an unlimited MetroCard. </p>

<p>The price comparison is, on the surface, tempting: two daily trips on the four-week unlimited Uber card comes to $2 per trip, compared to $2.65 per trip on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/22/mta_subway_fare_hike.php">$116.50 30-day MetroCard</a>. That&apos;s more than a 20% savings for those who take Uber instead of the subway.</p>

<p>&quot;We are hoping to make commuting in the hot summer just a little bit easier,&quot; said Josh Mohrer, Uber NYC General Manager, in a statement. (The app has no plans, as of now, for year-round unlimited passes.) </p>

<p>But there are other factors to consider. For one, this promotion won&apos;t carry you home to Brooklyn, Queens or the Bronx. Rush hour is peak traffic time&#x2014;when it arguably makes more sense to bike home, or cram onto an express train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/20/obvious_confirmed.php">like a sardine</a>. Also, Uber drivers are under no obligation to accommodate handicapped riders, and public transit is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/tags/globalwarming">much less of a pollutant</a>. And, the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/25/cuomo_finally_funded_the_mta_capita.php">desperately needs your money</a>. </p>

<p>Paul Steely White of the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives said Tuesday that he appreciated Uber&apos;s commuter pass idea, because he believes it will help convince the city that a more comprehensive surface transit system is necessary, beyond the underground tubes. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a good thing that the market is responding,&quot; he said, suggesting that crumbling subway infrastructure is sending commuters running to street level, to bike or bus or carpool. &quot;But the city has a role to play in keeping this from becoming a free-for-all on our streets. The most important thing is that our city regulate the streets in a way that favors higher-occupancy modes... like restricting private car use in Midtown, or instituting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/congestion_pricing_mta.php">congestion pricing</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>So, will thousands of these passes sell like hotcakes in less than 60 seconds this afternoon? Can Uber diehards be bothered with a promotion that won&apos;t carry them outside Manhattan&#x2014;especially since the app is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/11/uber_bouroughs_nyc.php">always pushing its transit desert service</a>? Do people who love Uber enough to jump on a Gilt promotion submit themselves to subway sweat under <em>any</em> circumstances? Only time will tell. </p>

<p>In the meantime, here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/01/uber_protest_strike.php#photo-1">primer on full-time Uber drivers&apos; primary grievances</a> with the company, which they argue has steadily chipped away at their livelihood in an effort to maximize profits. A spokesman for the app said Tuesday that this summer promotion will not have an impact on driver take-home&#x2014;that the app will compensate its drivers the full UberPool fare. Still, many Uber drivers say that compensation is far from adequate. </p>

<p>&quot;I pay $1,000 a month for my car, which I financed through Uber, and I pay $500 for insurance, and every year I pay $620 for my TLC license, and we don&#x2019;t even make tips,&quot; one driver told us at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/01/uber_protest_strike.php#photo-1">rally against fare cuts</a> in February. &quot;So it all adds up.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In its quest to monopolize and dominate, Uber makes workers pay the price,&quot; said New York Taxi Workers Alliance spokeswoman Bhairavi Desai, a longtime critic of the app. &quot;Transit workers are facing displacement while Uber drivers are left earning poverty wages.&quot; </p>

<p>Several thousand drivers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115940/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/11/uber_drivers_are_campaigning_for_a.php">making a push</a> this summer for an in-app tipping option&#x2014;an adjustment Uber seems unwilling to entertain.
