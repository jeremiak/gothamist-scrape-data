<p>Staring down MTA chairman Tom Prendergast from their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020407/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzbs8tTQQhA">swivel chair perches</a> on Thursday, state legislators repeatedly wondered aloud how the transit authority is presenting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020407/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/24/mta_money_cuomo.php">$26 billion capital plan</a> that does not include&#x2014;even in the fine print&#x2014;an explanation of where exactly that funding is coming from. </p>

<p>&quot;I really can&apos;t remember any program that we closed down on that we didn&apos;t know&#x2014;to the extent of that amount of money&#x2014;where it was coming from,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020407/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2016/02/8591986/state-legislators-bewildered-cuomos-mta-plan">said</a> Brooklyn Senator Marty Golden. &quot;Corporate America would laugh at this. Any country would be surprised with this type of approach in funding.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How does this make sense?&#x201D; echoed Brooklyn Assemblyman Jim Brennan. </p>

<p>&quot;[There is] an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020407/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/28/mta_fare_hike_judgment_day.php">unbroken tradition</a> of NY State at the legislative and executive level getting the funding necessary. I can&apos;t underscore that more,&quot; insisted Prendergast, a Cuomo appointee, on Thursday. </p>

<p>While Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020407/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/at_last_cuomo_and_de_blasio_have_ag.php">announced in October</a> that they had finally come to an agreement on funding for the 2015-2019 MTA capital plan&#x2014;$2.5 billion from the City, and $8.3 billion from the State&#x2014;the plan has yet to be approved by the state legislature. The Governor&apos;s budget reiterates the multi-billion commitment, but without a specific timeframe for the payout&#x2014;an omission <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020407/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/report_cuomos_budget_punts_on_mta_c.php">some advocates</a> deem crucial. From the budget proposal [emphasis ours]:</p>

<blockquote>The additional funds provided by the state... shall be scheduled and made available to pay for the costs of the capital program <strong>after MTA capital resources planned for the Capital Program, not including additional city and state funds, have been exhausted,</strong> or when MTA capital resources planned for the capital plan are not available.</blockquote>

<p>&quot;I consider it to be basically an IOU, because the way I understand it is that the MTA has to basically exhaust all of its resources before it could draw down any dollars,&quot; said Senator Martin Dilan on Thursday. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s an IOU, but it&apos;s relatively common in government where those types of understandings are made,&quot; Prendergast tossed back. </p>

<p>Reached for comment earlier this month, both the Governor&apos;s office and the MTA confirmed that the budget proposal doesn&apos;t include a set date for when funds would be allocated. However, both offices insisted that the proposal is &quot;iron-clad&quot; in its eventual funding commitment.</p>

<p>Jamison Dague, a researcher for the Citizens Budget Commission, said this month that there&apos;s truth to both sides of the argument. On the one hand, the budget&apos;s language does technically back up Cuomo&apos;s funding commitment. On the other hand, &quot;It does punt on how and when.... The State sort of made themselves a funder of last resort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Governor has not included anything about where the money will come from,&quot; Dague added. &quot;They could require the MTA to borrow from them. The concern is that the State wouldn&apos;t support [the MTA&apos;s] debt in the future.&quot; In other words, the current language doesn&apos;t protect the MTA from future debt if the State decides to loan its billions, rather than grant them. </p>

<p>&quot;I have a very high confidence level that the money will be there,&apos;&apos; Prendergast maintained on Thursday. &quot;Not without some challenges in terms of where you find the funding sources, I totally get that, but I have a very high degree of confidence that the money will be found.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course, even<em> if</em> the budget&apos;s funding was indisputably concrete, its fate would still be in the hands of the type of legislators who prioritize money for roads and bridges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020407/http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/19/mta-deal-upstate-roads-bridges/74234922/">in the Finger Lakes Region</a>.</p>
