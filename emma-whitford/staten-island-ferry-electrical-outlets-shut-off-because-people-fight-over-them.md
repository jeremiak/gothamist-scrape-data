<p>For the latest installment of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124717/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/11/vandalism_school.php">Why New Yorkers Can&apos;t Have Nice Things</a>, step aboard the Staten Island Ferry, where riders have reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124717/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/staten_island_ferry_electrical_outlets.html">been fighting so viciously</a> over power outlets that the Department of Transportation decided to shut them off. A basic refresher course on sharing apparently fell to the wayside after a ferry worker got punched to the ground while attempting to break up a power outlet-related dispute and had to be put on medical leave. Are all New Yorkers only-children? </p>

<p>The city didn&apos;t make a formal announcement about the dead outlets, nor would it confirm when the punishment went into effect. </p>

<p>However, it turns out the DOT has retained the right to cut off power on Staten Island Ferry boats for several years, pre-dating the de Blasio administration. The decision was apparently born of a request for assistance from the NYPD, after cops decided that the outlets posed a safety threat. Apple chargers trailing across the boat decks during rush hour also pose a tripping threat, according to the city. Also, don&apos;t leave your $1,200 laptop charging on a ferry bench, because someone might decide to steal it. </p>

<p>&quot;This was done for public safety purposes in conjunction with NYPD following a presence of criminal activity and we are reviewing the current policy,&quot; said DOT spokesman Scott Gastel. </p>

<p>While we wait this one out, it&apos;s worth remembering that the most enjoyable Staten Island Ferry activity involves drinking a tall boy out of a paper bag, a pastime that does not require a power outlet.</p>
