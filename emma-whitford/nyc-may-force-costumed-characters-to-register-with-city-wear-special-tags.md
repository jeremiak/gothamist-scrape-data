<p>A Bronx City Council Member has quietly resurrected a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/costume_law_nyc.php">dormant bill</a> that would require costumed characters to register with the City and wear identification or risk civil, and possibly criminal, consequences&#x2014;less than a month after the Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/all_who_leave_activity_cage_will_be_dealt_with.php">voted</a> to confine costumed characters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/tags/desnudas">desnudas</a> and ticket sellers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/times_square_so_quirky_yay.php">designated zones</a> within the Times Square pedestrian plaza.</p>

<p>&quot;We have to identify who the people are out there,&quot; bill sponsor Andy King told us on Wednesday, referencing people who pose for photographs with tourists in exchange for tips. &quot;When you put them in zones, you don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a pedophile or a gentleman who&apos;s wanted for murder in there. We need to weed the bad actors out.&quot; </p>

<p>The bill as drafted, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1903343&amp;GUID=5A45C651-7373-4589-86B4-F77DD0FD5CFC">Int. 467A</a>, would require all &quot;costumed individuals&quot; who solicit for tips (face makeup counts, anything that &quot;obscures or shrouds the face&#x2026; beyond recognition&quot;) to register with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/index.page">Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA)</a> and obtain a license, to be worn at all times and &quot;exhibited upon demand to any police officer.&quot; The NYPD would be empowered to order costumed characters&#x2014;on any sidewalk, in any plaza, park, subway, or arena&#x2014;to remove their head pieces for an ID <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/all_who_leave_activity_cage_will_be_dealt_with.php"></a> check. Anyone found soliciting without proper ID would be subject to a civil penalty&#x2014;$25 to $100 for the first offense, and between $100 and $250 for all subsequent offenses. </p>

<p>Applicants would also be required to pay a $30 registration fee to the DCA and provide proof of address, a &quot;full-face&quot; photograph, and a government-issued ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/12/nyc_municipal_id.php">IDNYC</a>, a drivers license). The ID would be valid for two years. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/index.aspx">Times Square Alliance</a>, a business-interest group that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/times_square_disney_crackdown.php">lobbied heavily</a> for activity zones on the pedestrian plaza between 42nd and 47th streets this spring&#x2014;citing a recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/11/times_square_freedom_zones.php">flood</a> of tabloid coverage and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Inappropriate-Tickling-Elmo-Dominates-Times-Square-Alliances-Top-Ten-Tweets-Complaining-of-Costumed-Characters-20160328">civilian complaints</a> about &quot;aggressive&quot; desnudas and costumed characters&#x2014;says it didn&apos;t hear about King&apos;s plans to resurrect his 2014 legislation until several days after the activity zones legislation passed. </p>

<p>The Alliance did, however, endorse King&apos;s bill two years ago, amid pushback from politicians and advocates. Costumed characters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://mashable.com/2014/08/19/times-square-characters-protest/#yTMw1zRCWkqU">protested in Times Square</a>, and Brooklyn council member Robert Cornegy said the proposal &quot;further criminalizes the least among us.&quot; </p>

<p>Yesterday, the Alliance called King&apos;s bill &quot;potentially... another useful tool,&quot; saying it could &quot;create credibility for the characters... in the same way a police badge or a taxi medallion does.&quot; </p>

<p>James Franzetti, an attorney currently representing a handful of costumed characters, countered on Wednesday that the majority of his clients&apos; charges are dismissed in court, and that the bill, in combination with the activity zones, encourages unlawful arrests. </p>

<p>&quot;This bill grants the NYPD a blank check to stop and detain these costumed characters and undoubtedly diminishes their civil rights,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;This bill should be read in tandem with regulation granting the DOT the authority to create activity zones in Times Square. The goal&#x2026; is to fully corporatize Times Square.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="033016_Rendering.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/033016_Rendering.jpeg" width="640" height="521"> <br> <i> (via DOT)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Testifying on Wednesday, both the NYPD and DCA argued that the bill as-written is too lax, and called for more enforcement and regulatory power. DCA Deputy Commissioner Edwin Torres said that his agency should have the right to revoke or refuse a license, based on an applicant&apos;s criminal history. &quot;[An ID] might signal to consumers that it is safe to transact with its holder,&quot; he said. &quot;Creating a DCA registration without giving the agency the power to revoke or refuse undermines confidence in the DCA.&quot; </p>

<p>Chief William Morris of Manhattan South added that his officers would be hard pressed to discipline bad actors without any threat of criminal consequence. &quot;The lack of any criminal penalty presents a challenge to enforcement,&quot; he said. &quot;There would be no practical way for a police officer to properly issue a civil penalty if the character refuses to show ID. A criminal penalty must be available in order to compel the person to produce identification.&quot; </p>

<p>King replied that he was amenable to criminal penalties. &quot;We need to make sure it&apos;s in there so you have the power to act,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;We need to put the teeth in.&quot; </p>

<p>The only civilian to testify against King&apos;s legislation on Wednesday was Jose Escalona-Martinez, a Times Square Batman who has sued the City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/dark_night_returns_to_court.php">multiple times</a> for wrongful arrest. Sitting alone before the Council, he said that the legislation would further vilify costumed characters. </p>

<p>&quot;I already have a driver&apos;s license, and my colleagues have driver&apos;s licenses,&quot; he said. &quot;[Is this] so you guys can put us in peril? What is the meaning of giving us an ID when I already have an ID, you know?&quot; </p>

<p>Escalona-Martinez and some of his fellow costumed characters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/council_times_square_character.php">balked</a> at the activity zone legislation last month, arguing that it was drafted without their input, impedes their right to freedom of speech, and could negatively impact their business. Last month, Franzetti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813172600/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/all_who_leave_activity_cage_will_be_dealt_with.php">confirmed plans</a> to file suit against the city on their behalf. </p>

<p>&quot;The police... they don&apos;t want us to be out there,&quot; Escalona-Martinez added. &quot;They just want to take control... [We] are just human beings. The city, the police&#x2014;they put us in jail because of our reputation in the news.&quot; </p>

<p>King told us Wednesday morning that his original bill was &quot;bogged down&quot; with certain provisions, like a $175 licensing fee and a requirement that costumed characters submit fingerprints. </p>

<p>Somewhat ironically, King also pushed back against an early provision that the characters be relegated to certain areas within the plaza. &quot;Caging isn&apos;t the way,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Asked if he believed the new version of his bill would be detrimental to costumed characters in combination with the recently-approved activity zones, he said it would not. &quot;It&apos;s not too much, because my legislation addresses something that theirs doesn&apos;t at all,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Manhattan Council Members Dan Garodnick and Corey Johnson, who sponsored the activity zone bill, did not immediately comment on King&apos;s bill&#x2014;whether they endorsed it, or had been aware of it before their own legislation passed. </p>
