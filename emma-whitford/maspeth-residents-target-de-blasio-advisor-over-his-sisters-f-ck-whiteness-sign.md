										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="111716_Restler.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/111716_Restler.jpg" width="320" height="427"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> (via Facebook)</i></div> More than 50 protesters, including Maspeth, Queens residents, gathered in Greenpoint on Wednesday night to protest outside the home of Lincoln Restler, a senior advisor to Mayor Bill de Blasio. Banging on kitchen pots, they accused Restler of divisiveness and racism for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mayor-de-blasio-aide-ripped-racist-facebook-photo-article-1.2876568">posting a picture on Facebook</a> in which his sister holds a cardboard sign that reads &quot;Fuck Whiteness.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Restler, who is white, captioned the post with a message about standing in solidarity with immigrant families, apparently in response to President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/trump_deport_2_million_people.php">promise</a> to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. &quot;To celebrate my mama&apos;s birthday, we took to the streets to stand in solidarity with immigrant New Yorkers,&quot; Restler wrote. In the post, which has since been deleted, Restler&apos;s mother holds a sign that reads &quot;Love,&quot; and his father a sign that reads &quot;Black + Brown + Immigrant Lives Matter.&quot; </p>

<p>Wednesday&apos;s protest &quot;was a bunch of white people saying another white person was being racist against white people,&quot; summarized Rebecca, who lives in Greenpoint and could see and hear the group chanting on Driggs Street. (She declined to give her last name.)</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re on a fourth floor walkup and we were able to hear the air horns and bullhorn shouting from our apartment,&quot; she added. </p>

<p>Maspeth resident Robert Holden, president of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://www.junipercivic.com/">Juniper Park Civic Association</a>, participated in Wednesday&apos;s protest and said that Restler&apos;s photograph was proof that Mayor de Blasio endorses hate. </p>

<p>&quot;[The mayor] thinks it&apos;s all right to protest and put out anti-white racial comments,&quot; Holden said. &quot;That is just divisive. He is supposed to bring the city together. For a senior advisor to the mayor to think that&apos;s okay to post, shows how incompetent he is.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Once it was exposed the little coward took it right down rather than try to explain it,&quot; Holden added. &quot;The mayor should be putting out a statement to apologize.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayoral spokeswoman Aja Worthy-Davis told Gothamist Wednesday that the Mayor did not think that Restler&apos;s post was appropriate. &quot;It was removed by Lincoln,&quot; she said. &quot;I think his intention was to protest white supremacy. Obviously it was not well articulated. He has been spoken to and we&apos;re moving on.&quot; </p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s Office declined to comment on Wednesday&apos;s protest. </p>

<p>Holden&apos;s civic group has been active in Maspeth since the summer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/27/maspeth_shelter_protest.php">rallying with other local residents</a> against a Department of Homeless Services plan to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/01/maspeth_homeless_shelter.php">convert</a> a Holiday Inn Express Hotel in their neighborhood into a homeless shelter for adult families. The original plan has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/post_181.php">since been scrapped</a>, though DHS is currently renting out 30 rooms to use as shelter beds for employed homeless men. </p>

<p>Maspeth residents have argued that a shelter will diminish their safety and quality of life, while City Hall has countered that it has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/city/6563-bill-de-blasio-versus-nimbyism">little patience</a> for communities unwilling to accommodate their fair share of city services. Maspeth residents have also speculated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/city/6563-bill-de-blasio-versus-nimbyism">that a City Hall video</a> featuring protesters outside of another Queens shelter, in which chants of &quot;White Lives Matter!&quot; are audible, features dubbed-in audio. Denying the chants, Holden accused City Hall of holding up a double standard: accusing Maspeth residents of racism while being racist (anti-white) itself. </p>

<p>Rebecca, Restler&apos;s neighbor, said that she saw &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; hats in the crowd of protesters on Wednesday, and Holden said he saw &quot;one person wearing a hat.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How is that relevant?&quot; he added. &quot;Maspeth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/numbers/clinton-trump-president-vice-president-every-neighborhood-map-election-results-voting-general-primary-nyc">went for Hillary Clinton</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>President-elect Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205312/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/steve_bannon_trump_strategist.php">recent decision</a> to appoint Steve Bannon as Chief of Staff further solidifies his alignment with a media mogul who has stoked and expressed anti-immigrant, Anti-Semitic, and white supremacist views. Kenneth Lovett, a Daily News reporter who reported on the reaction to Restler&apos;s Facebook post, Tweeted about an anti-Semitic comment he received in its wake. </p>

<p>Restler deferred comment to the Mayor&apos;s Office. </p>
