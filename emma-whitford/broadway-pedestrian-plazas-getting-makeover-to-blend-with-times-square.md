<p>A business interest group that oversees the pedestrian plazas on Broadway between 35th and 41st streets is working with the Department of Transportation on a makeover plan that would lift the two-lane plaza to sidewalk level and fill it with plantings, bright lighting, and new furniture. </p>

<p>&quot;Right now it&apos;s really just painted asphalt,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180037/http://garmentdistrictnyc.com/about/">Garment District Alliance</a> President Barbara Blair Randall told us on Monday. &quot;There are chairs and plantings but [when you&apos;re out there] you really have a sense that you&apos;ve just coopted part of the street.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We don&apos;t really blend with our bookended neighbors right now,&quot; she added. &quot;If you look north it&apos;s like this blazing light from Times Square, and if you look to the south, where Macy&apos;s is, it&apos;s lit. We&apos;re hoping to accomplish that with Broadway Boulevard.&quot; </p>

<p>The project is expected to cost about $70 million and take five years to implement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180037/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/broadway-pedestrian-plazas-glitzed-article-1.2637872">according to the Daily News</a>. Before construction gets underway, the Alliance is planning to install wooden planks to lift the boulevard to sidewalk level for the summer months. </p>

<p>Former transportation commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180037/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/nyregion/11broadway.html">installed Broadway Boulevard</a> in 2008, reducing the traffic lanes on the six block stretch from four to two. The move was part of Sadik-Khan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180037/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/janette_sadik-khan_interview.php">city-wide mission</a> to reclaim road space for pedestrians, with similar small plazas on Willoughby Street in Downtown Brooklyn, and Pearl Street in DUMBO. </p>

<p>At the time, Randall told the NY Times that she predicted the plaza would  &quot;transform all of Broadway, visually and mentally.&quot; And while critics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180037/http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/08/26/in-week-of-carnage-times-looks-askance-at-broadway-traffic-calming/">doubted</a> whether suits would eat takeout next to an active lane of traffic, lunch breakers quickly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180037/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-09-22-broadway_N.htm">proved them wrong</a>. </p>

<p>Today, Randall said that the plaza has a &quot;huge garbage problem,&quot; and is too dark at night to attract tourists south. She&apos;s hoping to install water fountains to cut back on the number of plastic bottles. </p>

<p>Asked if the Alliance had plans to manage tip solicitation on the Boulevard like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002180037/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/all_who_leave_activity_cage_will_be_dealt_with.php">their neighbors to the north</a>, Randall said she hoped her group wouldn&apos;t have to deal with the &quot;chaos&quot; in Times Square. </p>

<p>&quot;We have been <em>so</em> lucky, knock on wood,&quot; she said. &quot;The costumed characters really tend to stay in Times Square. Every once in a while they take their heads off and eat at one of our tables... but don&apos;t jinx it.&quot;</p>
