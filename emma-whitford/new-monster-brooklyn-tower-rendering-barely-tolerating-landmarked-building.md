<p>The proposed 73-story, 1,066-foot-tall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062052/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/17/hell_oh_brooklyn.php">monster tower</a> that luxury developers have proposed for Downtown Brooklyn is taller than a lot of things, including the Chrysler Building and every other building in Brooklyn. But while the this-is-what-your-impending-dystopia-looks-like rendering is good for some desk-side vertigo, new street level renderings of Brooklyn&apos;s First Giant Middle Finger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062052/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/3/14/11219218/brooklyn-skyscraper-shop-architects-nyc-landmark">leaked to Curbed</a> do a much better job of demonstrating what it means to &quot;incorporate&quot; a landmarked building into your plans for lucrative skyline domination. </p>

<p>The landmarked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062052/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20141218/REAL_ESTATE/141219834/brooklyn-landmark-could-become-100m-plus-buy">Brooklyn Dime Savings Bank</a> isn&apos;t going anywhere. It&apos;s right there in the middle background of this rendering. See it? </p>

<p>JDS Development Group and the Chetrit Group bought the Brooklyn Dime Savings Bank and its air rights (&quot;You only bought me for my air rights <em>didn&apos;t you</em>?&quot;) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904062052/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/06/luxury_brooklyn_towers.php">for $90 million</a> in 2014. Luckily for the bank and its dignity, these plans will still have to get past the Landmarks Preservation Commission. </p>
