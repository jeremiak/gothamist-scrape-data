<p>Following a press conference on heightened security at this weekend&apos;s upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174122/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/29/gay_pride_parade_nyc_2015.php">Pride Parade</a>, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton told reporters and Pride organizers that he did not believe the NYPD owed the LGBTQ community an apology for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174122/http://www.britannica.com/event/Stonewall-riots">Stonewall Riots of June 1969</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;There is no denying that out of that terrible experience came so much good,&quot; Bratton told reporters. &quot;It was the tipping point, if you will. So I think we should all celebrate that out of that terrible experience, a lot of good came.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;An apology? I don&apos;t think that&apos;s necessary,&quot; he added. &quot;The apology is all that&apos;s occurred since then.&quot; </p>

<p>To evidence improved relations, Bratton motioned to a group of openly gay NYPD officers sitting before him. </p>

<p>Bratton made his remarks at the LGBT Community Center on West 13th Street, about ten minutes&apos; walk north of the Stonewall Inn&#x2014;a popular gay bar in the late 1960s, frequently raided by a police force that also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174122/http://nypost.com/2014/05/03/why-nycs-gay-bars-thrived-because-of-the-mob/">made a habit</a> of arresting gay New Yorkers on lewdness charges. The riots, which broke out during a routine NYPD raid over liquor licenses, resulted in injuries on both sides. Stonewall Inn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174122/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/stonewall_inn_will_become_permanent.php">recently earned landmark status</a>, and is considered the site of a significant turning point in LGBTQ history, catalyzing a global push for LGBTQ rights. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio also referenced Stonewall during Thursday&apos;s press conference. &quot;We have the most vibrant LGBT community anywhere in the world, and we are the birthplace of the LGBT movement,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>As evidence of the NYPD&apos;s solidarity with that community, he referenced a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174122/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/nypd_shows_lgbt_pride_with_rainbow.php">rainbow-striped patrol car</a> parked outside the community center. &quot;I was very struck and appreciative of the car I saw outside,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a real act of solidarity and show of the NYPD&apos;s deep connection to this community.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s symbolic, but it&apos;s very moving symbolism,&quot; he added. &quot;An NYPD vehicle painted in the pride colors: In 1969 that would have been so inconceivable; there are no words in English for it.&quot; </p>

<p>Addressing reporters, NYC Pride Co-Chair David Studinski suggested that the NYPD&apos;s support in 2016 is not so much sufficiently apologetic, as it is ironic. </p>

<p>&quot;We could not do this without [the NYPD&apos;s] support,&quot; he said. &quot;If you know where this movement started, you&apos;ll appreciate that irony.&quot; </p>

<p>Bratton said on Thursday that the large security detail will &quot;focus on terrorism in light of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174122/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/stonewall_inn_will_become_permanent.php">Orlando</a>.&quot; In addition to thousands of uniformed police officers, the NYPD plans to deploy a large faction of undercover officers, as well as heavy weapons teams, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905174122/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/bratton_nypd_protest_unit.php">goon squad</a>. </p>

<p>Officers will also be stationed on rooftops, and deployed in the harbor. Helicopters will circle overhead. Surveillance cameras and radiation-detecting devises will be scattered along the route, and train stations and subway cars en route to the West Village will also be under heavy surveillance. </p>

<p>&quot;You will be safe. You will be protected,&quot; said Mayor de Blasio. &quot;You&apos;ll see additional measures to keep us safe.&quot;</p>
