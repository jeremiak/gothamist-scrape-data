(Governor&apos;s Office)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>When Governor Cuomo dumped a bucket of lofty, coffer-draining, logistics-be-damned infrastructure announcements last month&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/penn_station_renovation.php#photo-1">Penn Station-Apple Store hybrid</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/subway_facelift_shutdown.php">wifi-equipped subway system</a> coupled with lengthy station shutdowns, a Javits Center &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/monorail.php">for the next generation</a>&quot;&#x2014;some New Yorkers were still wrapping their heads around the possibility of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/27/laguardia_reboot_ferry.php">overhauled LaGuardia airport</a>, equipped with a ferry terminal and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/21/cuomos_laguardia_airtrain_will_be_g.php">ill-fated AirTrain</a>, for a cool $4 billion. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/http://www.wsj.com/articles/la-guardia-airport-revamp-peggedat-4-2-billion-1455587489?cb=logged0.20082781044766307">the Wall Street Journal is reporting</a> that the estimate has been bumped to $4.2 billion, thanks to previously unforeseen costs in overhauling 1960s-era Terminal B into a central terminal unifying the entire airport. One insider told the paper that financing could push the estimate closer to $5 billion. </p>

<p>To help cover these ballooning costs, LaGuardia is reportedly considering lifting the &quot;perimeter rule&quot;&#x2014;a 1984 restriction that prohibits the airport from hosting direct flights to cities more than 1,500 miles away from New York (why your Seattle/Hong Kong/Hawaii flights don&apos;t drop you at LGA). There&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/02/25/laguardia-perimeter-rule-to-go-away-maybe-report-says/24012295/">currently an exemption on Saturdays</a> (Delta apparently takes advantage with a weekly round-trip between LGA and Aruba), and direct flights to Denver are allowed, even though they technically exceed the mandated maximum trip length. </p>

<p>Lifting the ban would likely increase customer traffic and bring more expensive flights through the airport&#x2014;crowds that the currently-outdated airport would have a hard time handling. Still, the idea has long been backed by Delta, which is partnering with the Port Authority to carry out Cuomo&apos;s LGA renovation plans. </p>

<p>But WSJ reports that other airlines are pushing back, including JetBlue, which has a hub at JFK, and United, which has a Newark hub. (United Airlines executive Kate Gebo warned of &#x201C;significant impacts on air traffic, congestion and competition.&quot;) Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, who&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630064843/https://commercialobserver.com/2015/09/melinda-katz-leads-her-borough-through-high-times-with-a-little-bite/">on the Governors&apos; advisory panel</a> for the LGA overhaul, has called for a review of the possible environmental impacts from noise pollution and air traffic. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the decision to lift the perimeter rule is up to the Port Authority. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but an insider told WSJ that a decision likely won&apos;t be made until fall 2016. </p>

<p>Work is supposed to begin on the airport early next year, pending final Port Authority approval, with new sections accessible by summer 2019, and construction complete another year and a half later. Who&apos;s to say how much renovation costs will jump by then? </p>
