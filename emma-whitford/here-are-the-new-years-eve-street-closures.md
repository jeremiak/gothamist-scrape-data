<p>Soon, very soon, 2015 will be over. But now quite yet! Indeed, 2-0-1-5 will keep sucking the marrow out of us until the ball drops, and disrupt our cross-town sojourns in the process.</p>

<p>And since it&apos;s been another year of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150641/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/14/photos_new_yorkers_gather_in_union.php#photo-1">horror</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150641/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/16/bratton_encryption_terrorism.php">fear mongering</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150641/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/desnudas_topless_fearless.php">fear mongering backlash</a>, 2015&apos;s Times Square celebration will be graced with more police officers than ever before&#x2014;about 600-800 more than 2014, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150641/http://nypost.com/2015/12/29/nypd-beefing-up-security-in-times-square-for-new-years-eve/">6,000 in total</a>. </p>

<p>The short version: Time Square will be closed to cars starting around 4:00 a.m. on Thursday, and eager tourists will be shuttled into designated viewing stations starting around 11:00 a.m. Throughout the day on New Year&apos;s Eve, Times Square along Broadway and Seventh Avenue from 43rd Street to Central Park will become increasing crowded. If you&apos;re anywhere near, the NYPD says, don&apos;t drive, and definitely don&apos;t drink and drive. </p>

<p>Now for the specifics. </p>

<p>There will be no parking in the following areas from Thursday, December 31st at 12:01 a.m. until 1:00 a.m. on Friday, January 1st. When in doubt, take the train. </p>
