title: Priced Out Of Bushwick? New Staten Island Building Has Kale Smoothies, 'Bushwicky' Vibe

<p>&quot;Every residential place is like a fortress,&quot; said Erik Vermeulen of Amsterdam-based architecture firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.concreteamsterdam.nl/">Concrete</a>, his white Stan Smith Adidas sinking into bright green fake grass. &quot;So we said, let&apos;s turn the doorman into a barista. Let&apos;s make this an inviting place, not only to the residents but also the people outside.&quot;  </p>

<p>Vermeulen stood in the central courtyard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.urbystatenisland.com/">Urby</a>, Staten Island&apos;s newest, most expensive rental apartment complex, before a cluster of reporters and other press preview participants lounging on beanbag chairs. Behind him, the Upper Bay gave way to sweeping views of Downtown Manhattan and the Verrazano Bridge. Here, a studio rents for $1,735 and a two-bedroom for $3,310. A &apos;Bodega&apos; sells craft beer and vegetables harvested by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/31/fun_with_urban_farming.php">Farmer-in-Residence</a>, and a lobby doubles as a coffee shop strewn with succulents and ceramics. </p>

<p>Urby is adjacent to Stapleton&#x2014;a North Shore neighborhood of low-income homes and rentals that also encompasses the borough&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/01/the_poorest_enclaves_on_staten.html">second-poorest census tract</a>. There are large Mexican, Sri Lankan, Ghanaian and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2012/06/life-in-little-liberia-staten-island-067223">Liberian</a> immigrant populations. </p>

<p>Two Staten Island Railroad stops from the ferry terminal, Urby stands on land that used to be owned by the city. David Barry, CEO of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.ironstate.net/">Ironstate Development</a>, purchased the site for $11 million in 2011, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.nycedc.com/">Economic Development Corporation (EDC)</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a cautionary tale,&quot; said Nick Petrie of the housing nonprofit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.maketheroadny.org/">Make the Road</a>. &quot;We should not be selling public land to private developers.&quot; </p>

<p>Nearby, Bay Street is slotted for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/bay-street-corridor/bay-street-corridor.page">residential and commercial rezoning</a> as part of Mayor de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/16/depends_on_what_affordable_means.php">affordable housing plan</a>. And by the Staten Island Ferry terminal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/26/staten_islands_north_shore_might_lo.php">developers are hoping to generate more commercial activity in the borough by building out</a> an outlet mall and accompanying hotel, the tourist-friendly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/observation_wheel_staten_island.php#photo-1">New York Wheel</a>, and more shops, restaurants and apartments at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://triangleequities.com/lighthouse-point.html">Lighthouse Point</a>. The New York Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/realestate/an-islands-turning-point.html">hot neighborhood profile</a> dropped in April 2015. </p>

<p>For now, though, Urby is a bit ahead of the curve. &quot;It still feels kinda Bushwicky, in terms of what Bushwick was like seven or eight years ago,&quot; Barry told Gothamist on Tuesday, describing Stapleton. &quot;There&apos;s a bunch of industrial buildings, and it&apos;s a little scrappy still and kind of coming into its own. It&apos;s not one of those neighborhoods that has like, wow, gorgeous architecture. Like, you know, what Soho once was.&quot; </p>

<p>Local residents and advocates draw less cheery comparisons. </p>

<p>&quot;When I talk to the residents here about the rezoning, often the first question I ask is, &apos;Who here remembers what Williamsburg was like 10 or 15 years ago?&quot; said Petrie of Make the Road. &quot;A lot of the time the answer I get is, &apos;Yeah I grew up in Williamsburg,&apos; or, &apos;I grew up in Downtown Brooklyn,&apos; or, &apos;I grew up in Bed Stuy,&apos; but I&apos;ve been pushed out [here].&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;People are going to get blown out to Trenton or Elizabeth or Newark or God knows where,&quot; said Jay Harris, 45, a self-described full-time activist who lives in a shelter in nearby Port Richmond. &quot;There&apos;s no place left in New York.&quot; </p>

<p>About 70 Urby units have been leased out since this spring, many for slightly reduced rents of $1,508 for a studio and $2,507 for a two bedroom. &quot;It&apos;s half people who lived mid-island,&quot; Barry said. &quot;They work on Wall Street. [They] want to up it a little bit in a walkable neighborhood.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Most of the other half is coming from Downtown Manhattan,&quot; he added. &quot;Maybe FiDi people who are getting priced out.&quot; </p>

<p>Twenty percent of Urby&apos;s apartments are technically affordable, including 81 studios for $867 per month. To qualify, a family of four must make between $39,943 and $51,780 per year. For context, 23% of Bay Street Corridor residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://citylimits.org/2016/05/23/staten-island-area-targeted-for-growth-sees-debate-over-public-sites/">make less than 30% of the Area Median Income</a>, or $27,180 for a family of four. </p>

<p>All of the apartments are small&#x2014;from 380 square feet for a studio. &quot;Everything is very, very tiny,&quot; said Concord resident Shela Davis, 66, who toured Urby this spring. A retired pastry chef, Davis says she was escorted from the building when the leasing office realized she was interested in a subsidized apartment (the application deadline had apparently passed). &quot;Literally they had a chef on staff,&quot; she recalled. &quot;So I could sit up in my $3,000 apartment and call downstairs and say, &apos;Dude I want some asparagus and red wine?&apos;&quot; (Urby counters that the vibe is more first-come-first-serve samples and cooking lessons for residents.) </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="072016_Urby45.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/072016_Urby45.jpg" width="640" height="567"> <br> <i> (via Urby). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Zaro Bates, the Urby farmer, lives on site with her partner Asher Landes, who tends the Urby beehives. Both have blonde dreadlocks and, on Tuesday, wore colorful Hawaiian shirts. &quot;[Residents will] be on the elliptical and looking at the kale smoothies they&apos;re about to have,&quot; Bates said, standing on a garden bed and pointing to the adjacent gym. </p>

<p>Bates hosts a weekly farmers market&#x2014;part of Urby&apos;s efforts to, as Barry puts it, &quot;take formerly industrially or forlorn areas and knit them back into the urban environment.&quot; </p>

<p>Urby&apos;s entrance connects to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.nycedc.com/project/new-stapleton-waterfront">New Stapleton Waterfront</a>: a $32 million EDC project that the New York Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/realestate/an-islands-turning-point.html">recently compared</a> to Battery Park City. Two more parcels of public land are slotted for similar development in the coming years. </p>

<p>&quot;EDC is committed to unlocking the Stapleton waterfront,&quot; said spokesman Ryan Birchmeier in a statement. </p>

<p>Nicholas Siclari, chairman of Staten Island&apos;s Community Board 1, is optimistic. &quot;Fifteen years ago I moved to Bay Street Landing,&quot; he said. &quot;I was young and single and one-of-a-kind in that area. I think this is an opportunity for a young, urban group to be part of an exciting new community. Hopefully it will draw some new residents from Brooklyn and Manhattan.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I think there&apos;s no question that Urby is a gentrifying force,&quot; Bates said on Tuesday. &quot;But if they can create things that serve the neighborhood, like some fresh food in a food desert, that&apos;s a really cool thing.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stapleton is definitely on the verge,&quot; she added. &quot;There&apos;s this amazing Sri Lankan restaurant, and Snug Harbor is amazing.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="072016_Garden.JPG" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028161410im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/072016_Garden.JPG" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i>Zaro shows off the Urby farm on Tuesday (Emma Whitford / Gothamist). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;If you compare [these rents] to 30-year-old junk projects in the middle of Staten Island, they&apos;re going to be high,&quot; Barry said on Tuesday, defending his pricing. &quot;I think that you have to look at this as a metro area issue.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;To take an emotionally-charged argument and say, &apos;Oh well this is too expensive for Staten Island, I&apos;ve been in Staten Island for 40 years and, gosh, I don&apos;t approve of, you know, $2,000 apartments,&apos; I just don&apos;t think it&apos;s a valid logic stream,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>While close to a third of Staten Islanders in and around Bay Street make less than 30% of the AMI, nearly half make more than 80%, or $72,500 for a family of four. With further development planned for Bay Street and Stapleton, Petrie of Make the Road says the stakes are high. </p>

<p>&quot;If we do the rezoning wrong, it could take what is an integrated mixed-income neighborhood, and turn it into a much higher income, much more segregated neighborhood,&quot; he predicted.</p>

<p>&quot;When my children were kids, the North Shore was considered a country atmosphere,&quot; Davis, the retired pastry chef, said on Tuesday. &quot;Now that everybody wants to work in the city, everybody wants to live close to the ferry or close to the bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re seeing the change,&quot; she added. &quot;I see a lot of boarded up housing.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Mayoral spokesman Austin Finan said that affordability levels for future Staten Island residential developments will be based on &quot;extensive stakeholder input.&#x201D; He also stated: </p>

<blockquote>In addition to building 115 affordable apartments for families in Stapleton making as little as $33,326 a year, this project will deliver a number of community benefits including unlocking the waterfront for open, public space. We look forward to exploring more affordable housing in future phases of this project.</blockquote>
