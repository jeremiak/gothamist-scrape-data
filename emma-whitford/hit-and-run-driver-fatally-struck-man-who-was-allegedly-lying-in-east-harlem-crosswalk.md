<p>A 36-year-old East Harlem man was lying face-down in a Madison Avenue crosswalk when he was fatally struck by an SUV driver on Tuesday night, according to a preliminary NYPD investigation. Two drivers allegedly swerved around the victim before he was hit. </p>

<p>Officers responded to the corner of 115th Street and Madison Avenue, a block from the deceased&apos;s home, shortly before 10:00 p.m. There, they found Christopher Costa, 36, unconscious and unresponsive in the street. EMS transported Costa to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A preliminary investigation determined that the SUV driver was headed north on Madison Avenue when he struck Costa. </p>

<p>Costa&apos;s sister-in-law <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801193537/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/hit-and-run-driver-leaves-man-32-dead-e-harlem-street-article-1.2574354">told the Daily News</a> (which identified a 32-year-old Christopher Soto, in conflict with the NYPD&apos;s identification) that the victim was a construction worker. &quot;He was a very sweet, dear person. If he could help, he would,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>There have been no arrests as of Wednesday morning, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>A taxi driver was arrested on Sunday, a day after he allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801193537/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/20/hit-and-run_taxi_driver_arrested_fo.php">fatally struck</a> and dragged a woman who was lying in a Stuyvesant Town bus lane. The victim, 44-year-old Kenya Flores had reportedly been released from Bellevue Hospital earlier that night, where she had checked herself in citing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801193537/http://staging.gothamist.com/2016/03/21/hit-and-run_taxi_driver_arrested_fo_1.php">suicidal thoughts</a>. The driver was charged with leaving the scene of a crash resulting in death. </p>
