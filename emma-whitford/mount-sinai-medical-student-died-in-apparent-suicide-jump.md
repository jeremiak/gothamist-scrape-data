<p>Kathryn Stascavage, who grew up in Brookfield, Connecticut, had plans to pursue orthopedics research, according to her biography in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170124194449/http://www.onsf.org/docs/newsletters/onsf-spring-2011.pdf">2011 Greenwich Hospital newsletter</a>. &quot;I feel prepared for medical school and am quite confident in my career choice,&quot; she said at the time. Stascavage studied Biomedical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken undergrad, where she also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170124194449/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaAdaxPKo1k">played Varsity soccer</a>. </p>

<p>Police received a call about a body on the sidewalk outside the James B. Aaron Residence Hall at 50 East 98th Street at 5:20 a.m. on Wednesday. A spokesman for the department confirmed Friday that Stascavage had been living on the eighth floor, adding that she likely jumped from the window. The NYPD is reviewing surveillance footage.</p>

<p>&quot;She was happy to be here, she was engaged. I knew her group of friends. She wasn&apos;t quiet or detached,&quot; one anonymous fellow student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170124194449/http://nypost.com/2016/08/18/med-student-jumps-to-her-death-from-dorm-room-window/">told the NY Post</a>. &quot;[But] she was trying extra hard to do well and succeed.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;The entire Mount Sinai community is mourning the loss of one of our own,&quot; said Mount Sinai Health System in a statement Friday. &quot;We wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to the student&apos;s family and ask that you keep them in your thoughts in the days ahead.&#x201D;</p>
