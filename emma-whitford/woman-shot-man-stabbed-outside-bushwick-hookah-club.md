<p>A woman was shot in the leg and a man was stabbed in the stomach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601114657/http://abc7ny.com/news/1-shot-1-stabbed-after-fight-spills-out-of-bushwick-nightclub/1219790/">after a fight escalated</a> inside of a Brooklyn nightclub early Friday morning. The fight spilled out onto Broadway near the Myrtle JMZ train station, on the border of Bed-Stuy and Bushwick. </p>

<p>The NYPD responded to reports of a fight at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601114657/http://www.yelp.com/biz/club-republic-new-york">Club Republic</a>, a hookah bar and night club at 990 Broadway, around 1:38 a.m. on Friday, according to a spokeswoman from the department. There, they discovered a 20-year-old woman with a gunshot wound to the leg, and a 32-year-old man with a stab wound to the stomach. Both victims were transported to Kings County Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>Nicole Woszczyna lives a few blocks from the Myrtle-Broadway JMZ stop, and heard &quot;a ton of people yelling&quot; around 1:30 this morning. &quot;I went to my window and then heard what I can only imagine to be two gun shots, and everyone dispersed,&quot; she told us via e-mail. &quot;Aside from several cruisers, there was a helicopter circling around for the next half hour.&quot; </p>

<p>No arrests have been made as of this morning, and the NYPD could not immediately confirm how many suspects may have been involved. The investigation is ongoing. <br>
