<p>Plans to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/23/port_authority_redesign.php">start over from scratch</a> with a brand-new Port Authority Bus Terminal (must we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/26/bathroom_humor_air_quotes.php">throw out the baby</a> with the bathwater?) got an official stamp of approval from the Port Authority chairmen (emphasis on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/https://twitter.com/katehinds/status/713064507866787841">men</a>) on Thursday, who agreed to &quot;allocate the necessary funds for the project&apos;s construction&quot; even though the cost and exact location of the new terminal&#x2014;likely nearby on Manhattan&apos;s West Side&#x2014;are yet to be determined. </p>

<p>A release from the Port Authority gets specific only about where the new terminal will <em>not</em> be&#x2014;Secaucus, New Jersey, where Port Authority Cuomo-appointee Scott Rechler had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-24/commuters-rejoice-new-port-authority-bus-station-will-be-in-nyc">suggested sticking the replacement station</a>. &quot;By committing to build a much-needed 21st century bus terminal on the West Side of Manhattan, with the understanding that no bus terminal will be built in New Jersey, we are making a crucial investment in our region&apos;s economic growth,&quot; said Port Authority Chairman John Degnan in a statement. </p>

<p>The Authority, which committed billions on billions to infrastructure projects over the course of a few hours on Thursday&#x2014;director Patrick Foye <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/nyregion/port-authority-pledges-billions-for-airport-upgrades-and-new-bus-terminal.html?_r=0&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=5AB30258C4676DD7327844391E20E013&amp;gwt=pay">called the meeting</a> the &quot;single largest allocation of capital&quot; by the Authority in one day, ever&#x2014;also admitted that the cost of the new station is still up in the air, and will be determined based off of the results of an ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://www.panynj.gov/bus-terminals/pabt-bus-terminal-design.html">design competition</a>. The competition launched earlier this month, and the final design isn&apos;t likely to be selected until the fall, although three hypothetical designs presented to the board last year cost about $10 billion each. A condo tower will reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://therealdeal.com/2015/10/23/port-authority-bus-terminal-redesign-could-cost-10b/">eventually rise</a> from the ashes of the current terminal, helping cover the costs of the new one. </p>

<p>As recently as October, a working group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160325/hells-kitchen-clinton/new-port-authority-bus-terminal-coming-west-side-board-says">suggested</a> that the Port Authority&apos;s nearby land between Ninth and 11th avenues, a block West of the current terminal, would be a good spot for the replacement. This prompted a strongly-worded response from Manhattan&apos;s Community Board 4, as the move would likely require the bulldozing of existing businesses and residential buildings in Hell&apos;s Kitchen. </p>

<p>Also on Thursday, the Port Authority committed $35 million to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/24/tunnel_hudson_river_gateway.php">eventual</a> Hudson River tunnel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502123928/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/24/port_authority_approves_funding_for.php">about $4 billion</a> to LaGuardia&apos;s Terminal B (although the exact taxpayer burden of that project is up for debate), and $2.3 billion to revamp Terminal A at Newark. </p>
