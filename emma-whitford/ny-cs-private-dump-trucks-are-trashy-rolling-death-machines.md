<p>Private sanitation trucks that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/20/nyc_trashed.php">crisscross NYC</a> between downtown business districts and outer borough transfer stations have been caught operating with hundreds of maintenance violations that increase the likelihood of a crash, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/file:///Users/gothamist2015a/Downloads/Reckless%20Endangerment_truck%20safety%202016%20final.pdf">report</a> released yesterday by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://transformdonttrashnyc.org/">Transform Don&apos;t Trash NYC</a> coalition with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/https://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a>. </p>

<p>Over the last two years, trucks operated by the 20 largest private haulers in NYC were involved in 35 crashes, two of which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/18/bicyclist_killed_by_private_garbage.php">were</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/15/pedestrian_fatality_ues.php">deadly</a> (though neither was credited to a maintenance issue). They racked up 400 violations in the same time period, according to federal inspection reports, 384 of which have been attributed to maintenance issues: from faulty brakes and low-tread tires to busted headlights and turn signals. Inadequate supports for the trucks&apos; lifting mechanisms often spill trash and other cargo on the street, leaving slick smears. </p>

<p>When vehicles are banned from the road for mandatory repairs, the report alleges, work is often shoddy and insufficient. </p>

<p>Large vehicle fleets&#x2014;commercial sanitation trucks, but also buses and taxis&#x2014;account for about 20% of crashes that result in a pedestrian&apos;s serious injury or death, even though they only make up about 6% of vehicles on the road, according to the city. </p>

<p>The new report, which excludes statistics on the NYC Department of Sanitation&apos;s fleet of trucks, was backed in part by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://www.teamsters813.org/">Teamsters Local 813</a>, the union representing private sanitation workers in NYC. The Teamsters are longstanding critics of non-union sanitation haulers, and have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/29/commercial_waste_nyc.php">endorsed other reports</a> condemning the industry&apos;s safety measures and environmental impact. </p>

<p>Carl Orlando, 24, a construction worker, worked for seven different private haulers between 2011 and 2015. A supporter of the Teamsters&#x2014;none of the private haulers he worked for recognized the union&#x2014;he says he was wrongfully terminated from the last hauling company he worked for after a dispute over alleged wage theft. </p>

<p>&quot;One day last February I was driving from Manhattan to the dump in Greenpoint,&quot; he recalled on Thursday. &quot;I was on the Metropolitan Avenue bridge and I went to hit the brakes, and the car didn&apos;t stop. I made the decision to crash into a telephone pole. It turns out the brake line had frozen.&quot; He alleges that the hauler, Queens County Carting, had failed to winterize the vehicle.  </p>

<p>In order to keep safety-compromising violations in check, Transform Don&apos;t Trash NYC is reiterating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/20/nyc_trashed.php">its call</a> for a zoning system that would confine private waste management companies to geographic zones. Commercial waste zones would decrease truck traffic, they argue, as trucks would no longer cover long, winding cross-borough routes. The report also calls for mandatory seat belts for sanitation workers, and a database for keeping track of all sanitation truck-involved crashes. </p>

<p>Reached for comment, DSNY spokeswoman Belinda Mager confirmed that the department is conducting a study on the feasibility of commercial waste zones, adding that, &quot;we work with our public and private sector peers in New York and across the country to share best practices.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayoral spokesman Austin Finan added in a statement, &quot;We are always looking for ways to improve the safety of the vehicles on our streets and look forward to reviewing the group&apos;s recommendations.&quot; </p>

<p>By 2024, all private and public sanitation trucks in NYC will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104008/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/27/truck_side_guards_nyc.php">equipped with side guards</a>&#x2014;panels that are designed to prevent pedestrians and cyclists who are struck by trucks from being trapped underneath them.</p>
