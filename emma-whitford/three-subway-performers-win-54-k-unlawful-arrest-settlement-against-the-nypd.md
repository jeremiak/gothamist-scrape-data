<p>Three longtime subway buskers won $54,500 from the City this month, in a joint wrongful arrest lawsuit against the NYPD. One of the musicians, Andrew Kalleen, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/19/video_subway_busker_arrested.php">arrested and charged with loitering in the fall of 2014</a> after reciting his legal right to perform on the Metropolitan G train platform to an impassive NYPD officer. A straphanger took a video of Kalleen&apos;s arrest, which has been viewed more than a million times since. One of the arresting officers struck Kalleen in his face with his own guitar, before placing him in custody for five hours. </p>

<p>The other two plaintiffs on the case, Jadon Woodward and James Gallagher of the freestyle hip hop group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/https://soundcloud.com/jadonwoodard/stories-for-days-the-ep">Stories For Days</a>, were arrested in November 2013 on the Hoyt-Schermerhorn G train platform. According to court papers, they were approached by four undercover offers around 10:30 p.m. on November 23rd, and later told by a superior officer that &quot;there was a memo out to clean you guys up.&quot; Woodward spent 24 hours in central booking, and both men&apos;s loitering charges were dismissed after a single court appearance. </p>

<p>Gallagher recalled this week that a woman had just handed Woodward a dollar when the officers approached. &quot;They just said we were soliciting and that they wanted to... check us and detain us in the precinct,&quot; he said. According to the performers, officers ran their names three times to see if they had any outstanding arrests, to no avail. </p>

<p>&quot;They were just looking for something to arrest us for, and the white shirt says, &apos;This young black man doesn&apos;t have a warrant? Run him again,&apos;&quot; Gallagher recalled. The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on these allegations. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm#purpose">Section 1050.6c</a> of the MTA rules clarifies that &quot;artistic performances, including the acceptance of donations&quot; are permissible. Musicians aren&apos;t allowed to use amplifiers or solicit payment on subway platforms (that counts as panhandling, which isn&apos;t allowed), but acoustic performance with a tip jar is legal. </p>

<p>In the wake of Kalleen&apos;s arrest, an NYPD spokesperson said that he had been accepting donations &quot;without permit of permission&quot; from the MTA. He had an open ticket or warrant on his record, and was arrested and charged with loitering. The charges were eventually dropped. </p>

<p>&quot;I really felt like these police were just targeting us, like they needed to write paperwork,&quot; Gallagher said on Monday. &quot;It had nothing to do with protecting citizens or being righteous, that&apos;s for sure.&quot; </p>

<p>Woodward and Gallagher&apos;s wrongful arrest case was moving slowly at the state level in 2014 when Kalleen was arrested, drawing attention to buskers&apos; rights. All three sought help from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/https://buskny.com/mission/">Busk NY</a>, an advocacy group for subway performers founded by Matthew Christian, a classically-trained violinist who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/27/violinist_arrested_for_playing_viol.php">has also been arrested</a> multiple times while performing underground. </p>

<p>Attorney Paul Hale took on all three clients and brought their case to federal court, where things moved quickly. Hale said on Monday that while Kalleen&apos;s case received an unusual amount of publicity, these arrests are common&#x2014;he personally has represented five cases involving buskers since 2014. &quot;Unamplified performance on subway platforms is 100% legal and has been for decades,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;The harassment and arrests of buskers needs to stop. Until then, using the Courts is their best recourse.&quot; </p>

<p>Christian said on Monday that buskers have won more than $100,000 in settlements since NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton was appointed in 2013. Busk NY makes the case that buskers have been targeted as part of Bratton&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/broken_windows_de_blasio.php">Broken Windows</a> policing strategy (there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/nypd_now_cracking_down_on_subway_ve.php">numbers</a> to back this up), but haven&apos;t won considerable compensation until recently. &quot;By organizing the community we have affected real change, and gotten people compensated,&quot; he said. &quot;Since Commissioner Bratton came in, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301233312/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/12/subway_performers_nypd.php">predicted that we would win $100,000</a>. I don&apos;t want to celebrate that those incidents happened, but indeed we have surpassed.&quot; </p>

<p>Stories For Days is pooling its settlement to produce a new album. &quot;[This has] allowed me some time off,&quot; Gallagher added. &quot;We didn&apos;t get a lot of money in the grand scheme of things... but it&apos;s made a positive effect on our community. People feel like now they have a recourse.&quot; </p>
