<p>A police officer shot and wounded a Brooklyn man on Sunday evening whom investigators say was emotionally disturbed, and allegedly charged at a group of cops with a replica of the three-sided mystical, golden dagger from the 1994 Alec Baldwin movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042551/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_(1994_film)">The Shadow</a>. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, officers received a call about an emotionally disturbed man at 6809 Avenue T near Veterans Avenue in Bergen Beach, around 7:11 p.m. on Sunday. When they arrived, a 27-year-old man allegedly exited the address with a dagger and &quot;charged&quot; at the officers. One officer fired two shots, striking the man in the torso. </p>

<p>The victim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042551/http://nypost.com/2016/05/08/cops-shoot-deranged-knife-wielding-man/">identified by the Post</a> as one Simon Zanchman, had reportedly been seen kicking car doors along the street before officers arrived. The replica &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042551/http://www.weaponreplica.com/limited-edition/the-shadow-phurba-dagger-united-cutlery/">Phurba Dagger</a>&quot; he allegedly charged with was about eight inches in length, with a five-inch blade. </p>

<p>&quot;He talks to himself. Something was wrong with him,&quot; one witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042551/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-with-Knife-Wounded-by-Police-in-Brooklyn-NYPD-378591216.html">told NBC</a>, of Zanchman. </p>

<p>Charges against Zanchman were pending as of Monday morning. In addition to the replica dagger, cops said they recovered a switchblade from his pocket. </p>
