<p>Earlier this afternoon, a 47-year-old Joker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144035/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/joker_times_square_costumes.php">stood up from his seat</a> in the City Council chambers and described a New York City that he has come to disdain&#x2014;in his estimation, now &quot;the most fascist, prudish city alive.&quot; And while the Department of Transportation initially declined our request for a rendering of the proposed &quot;activity zones&quot; that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144035/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/29/first_they_came_for_the_creepies.php">could soon corral</a> costumed characters and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144035/http://gothamist.com/tags/desnudas">desnudas</a> into designated blue-painted boxes roughly the size of a city bus, the press office has since complied. </p>

<p>&quot;These are not tiny little areas that people cannot fit in,&quot; said Councilmember Dan Garodnick, who&apos;s sponsoring the legislation, on Wednesday. &quot;In no way is anyone trying to tamp down free speech, and nobody&apos;s saying that people can&apos;t be in the plazas at all. It&apos;s just that we&apos;re trying to get a little bit of order.&quot; </p>

<p>In the DOT&apos;s estimation, &quot;a little bit of order&quot; apparently comes in the form of NYPD-blue grids set off by cheery Wallgreens red, and a corridor just wide enough for some healthy competition between Elmo, Elsa, and Lady Liberty&#x2014;all cast in the shadow of a vigilant NYPD officer&apos;s gaze. Please briefly pose for your photo and move along to the Olive Garden or one of the many other Times Square Alliance member establishments.</p>

<p>&quot;What we&apos;ve always said is Times Square should be unusual,&quot; Times Square Alliance president Tim Tompkins said earlier this week, standing on the plaza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144035/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/times_square_disney_crackdown.php">alongside the Naked Cowboy</a>. &quot;Quirky is fine, but creepy is not.&quot; (ONLY INDIVIDUALS OFFICIALLY CERTIFIED AS NON-CREEPY WILL BE PERMITTED IN AUTHORIZED ACTIVITY ZONES. ALL OTHERS PLEASE PROCEED TO DESIGNATED CREEPY ACTIVITY ZONES ON LONG ISLAND THANK YOU PLEASE MOVE ALONG AND HAVE A QUIRKY DAY :)</p>
