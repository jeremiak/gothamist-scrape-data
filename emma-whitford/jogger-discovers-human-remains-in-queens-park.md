<p>A jogger came across decomposed human remains while jogging in a Queens park on Wednesday afternoon, according to the NYPD. The grisly discovery was made in Kissena Park in Flushing, just before 1:15 p.m. near 164th Street and Underhill Avenue. </p>

<p>&quot;It was a badly decomposed body,&quot; a spokesman for the NYPD told Gothamist. &quot;We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s male or female or how long it had been there.&quot; </p>

<p>Detectives and crime scene specialists combed the area into the night on Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212180156/http://abc7ny.com/news/possible-human-remains-found-along-queens-jogging-path/1744356/">according to ABC</a>. Sources told the outlet that the remains appeared &quot;burned and scattered,&quot; though the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212180156/http://nypost.com/2017/02/09/jogger-discovers-decomposed-body-in-queens/">has stated</a> that it can&apos;t confirm signs of trauma. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve seen plumbing companies dumping things in the park,&quot; resident Sergio Hernandez told ABC. &quot;It&apos;s an isolated area.&quot; </p>

<p>The New York City Medical Examiner&apos;s office will determine the cause of death. </p>

<p>Around this time last year, a skull <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170212180156/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/skull_found.php">was discovered</a> in Peters Field Park in Jamaica, Queens. </p>
