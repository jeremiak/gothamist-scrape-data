<p>Stephen Rogata, the 19-year-old from Virginia who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612105054/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/10/trump_climber.php">attempted to gain an audience with Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump</a> by climbing the exterior of Trump Tower with giant suction cups, was arraigned in Manhattan court on Wednesday, a week after his arrest. The teenager reportedly appeared in court via video chat from Bellevue Hospital, where he&apos;s been held under observation for the last week. </p>

<p>The Manhattan DA&apos;s office confirmed that Rogata has been charged with reckless endangerment, BASE jumping, criminal trespass and trespass. His bail has been set at $10,000 bond and $5,000 cash. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612105054/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/11/trump_tower_climber_now_at_bellevue.php#photo-15">initial arrest charges</a> were reckless endangerment and criminal trespass.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612105054/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160817/civic-center/trump-tower-climber-held-on-10k-bail-after-failed-attempt-meet-trump">DNAInfo reports</a> that Legal Aid Society attorney Tara Collins asked the judge on Wednesday to take her client&apos;s mental state into consideration, arguing that prison would be detrimental to his health. </p>

<p>&quot;At best what he did was profoundly stupid and lacking in good judgment,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;As the court knows, 19-to-20 is the age when some mental illness begins to develop. Jail would be awful for my client.&quot; </p>

<p>Police say they received a 911 call of a person climbing Trump Tower in Midtown at 3:30 p.m. last Wednesday. According to the criminal complaint, a Trump Tower custodian saw Rogata begin his climb. Midtown North Sergeant Christopher Hewitson also testified that he saw Rogata &quot;drop a laptop from his person, and that the laptop landed on the fifth floor atrium where people were standing.&quot; Rogata managed to reach the 21st floor before officers pulled him in. </p>

<p>While Rogata was still mid-climb, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612105054/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP493LmSJrE">video surfaced</a> that appeared to show him professing his support for Trump and explaining why he decided to climb. </p>

<p>&quot;I am an independent researcher seeking a private audience with you to discuss an important matter,&quot; the young man in the video says. &quot;I guarantee that it&apos;s in your interest to honor this request. Believe me, if my purpose was not significant, I would not risk my life pursuing it.&quot; </p>

<p>Rogata&apos;s next court appearance is set for October 13th. </p>
