<p>Police are looking for a rapper and videographer who they believe attempted to rob, and then shot, a 19-year-old musician in the Bronx on Wednesday&#x2014;allegedly after arriving at the teenager&apos;s apartment to film a music video for him. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the suspect, who goes by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110937/https://twitter.com/WhiteyNineO">Whitey and Whitey Gz</a> on social media, attempted to rob the 19-year-old of his cellphone and backpack around 10:45 p.m. on Wednesday, in the 22nd-floor hallway at 3419 Irwin Avenue, in Kingsbridge. When the teenager resisted, Whitey allegedly took out a handgun and shot him in the left thigh before fleeing on foot. </p>

<p>Police responded and transported the victim to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>Cops said their preliminary investigation suggests that Whitey and the victim met on Dyer Avenue shortly before the robbery attempt, and took a cab to 3419 Irwin &quot;for the purpose of making a music video in which the victim was to be the talent and [Whitey] was to be the videographer.&quot; </p>

<p>Whitey, who has dreadlocks, is believed to have a tattoo that says &quot;Achieve the Impossible&quot; on his left arm and another that says &quot;Dream for Success&quot; on his right arm. He was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, black pants, and white sneakers. </p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
