<p>A Brooklyn man is among the 36 victims publicly identified so far in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/approximately_20_people_killed_at_g.php">mass shooting</a> at a gay nightclub just outside Orlando, Florida early Sunday morning that left 49 people dead (not counting the perpetrator) and more than 50 injured&#x2014;the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Enrique L. Rios, Jr., 25, was on vacation in Orlando this weekend. He worked as a coordinator for a Brooklyn elderly home-care provider, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/https://www.facebook.com/enrique.rios.142">according to his Facebook page</a>, and studied social work at St. Francis College. </p>

<p>Rios&apos;s mother has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/https://www.gofundme.com/294mtrw">launched a GoFundMe page</a> to raise money to return her son&apos;s body to Brooklyn for a funeral. &quot;I come as a humble, hurt, devastated mother,&quot; she wrote. &quot;My family is torn apart and all I would like is to have my son with me so he can the funeral he deserves.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My son was a good kid. He was just having a great time on his vacation, until this deranged man came in and shot the place up,&quot; she added. </p>

<p>The city of Orlando <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.cityoforlando.net/blog/victims/">has released</a> a running list of victims whose families have been notified, which will be updated periodically. A local helpline, 407-246-4357, has been set up for families still searching for their loved ones. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/orlando-shooting.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-abc-region&amp;region=span-abc-region&amp;WT.nav=span-abc-region&amp;_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, 48 of the 49 victims had been ID&apos;d as of Monday morning. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://abc7ny.com/news/bodies-removed-from-orlando-nightclub-after-worst-mass-shooting-in-us-history/1383234/">ABC reports</a> that bodies were removed methodically on stretchers throughout the day Sunday, four at a time, and placed in white vans. All of the deceased had been taken to the county medical examiner&apos;s office by 11:00 p.m., but doctors at local hospitals stressed that the majority of the 53 injured victims are in critical condition. The death toll is expected to increase.  </p>

<p>The shooter, who was killed by responding police after a lengthy standoff, has been identified as 29-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/orlando_gay_nightclub_shooter_repor.php">Omar Mateen</a>, a U.S. citizen who was living in Port St. Lucie, Florida when he carried out the deadly attack. </p>

<p>At a press conference early this morning, Orlando Police chief John Mina <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/os-orlando-nightclub-shooting-pulse-20160613-story.html">told reporters</a> that Mateen &quot;didn&apos;t ask for much&quot; during hostage negotiations. &quot;We were doing most of the asking,&quot; he added. Mina couldn&apos;t confirm whether any hostages were struck by police. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/os-orlando-nightclub-shooting-pulse-20160613-story.html">Orlando Sentinel</a> provided the latest update on the sequence of events as they are understood: </p>

<blockquote>...an officer working security at the club exchanged gunfire with Mateen near one of the entrances. The officer called for backup at 2:02 a.m. as Mateen ran inside and opened fire into the crowd on the dance floor. 

<p>Additional officers ran inside and immediately started exchanging fire with Mateen. </p>

<p>Mina said many people were then able to escape, as Mateen retreated to a bathroom.</p>

<p>He held about a handful of people hostage with him, while about 15 others hid in a nearby bathroom.</p>

<p>That&apos;s when Mateen called 911 and pledged alliance to the Islamic state, Mina said. </p>

<p>Crisis negotiators tried to work with him, Mina said, and during that time things &quot;stabilized.&quot; No shots were fired, but there was talk about explosives and a possible bomb vest.</p>

<p>Mina said he then -- three hours after the first gunshot -- gave the order for SWAT crews to use a battering ram to get inside. </p>

<p>They broke a 3-foot hole into one of the bathroom walls and pulled several people out.</p>

<p>Mateen, 29, followed for a final, fatal gun battle.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Mateen had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2016/06/12/omar-mateen-concealed-carry-license-security-license-florida/">two separate licenses</a> to carry firearms in Florida, and worked for private security company G4S. He was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and a handgun when he entered the nightclub Pulse around 2 a.m. Sunday morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/https://twitter.com/CBSNLive/status/742329078011695104">New footage acquired by CBS</a> seems to show Mateen firing 24 rounds in 9 seconds. </p>

<p>Mateen was born in New York, to Afghan parents. Although ISIS has since taken credit for the attack, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/12/orlando-nightclub-shooting/">stating that</a> it was &quot;carried out by an Islamic State fighter,&quot; it is as yet unclear whether Mateen had any communication with the extremists leading up to Sunday&apos;s massacre. According to his immediate family and ex-wife, Mateen was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/terror-hate-what-motivated-orlando-nightclub-shooter-n590496">extremely homophobic</a> and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ex-wife-of-suspected-orlando-shooter-he-beat-me/2016/06/12/8a1963b4-30b8-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html?tid=sm_tw">abusive partner</a>. </p>

<p>It has also been confirmed that Mateen was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/12/omar-mateen-id-d-as-orlando-killer.html">investigated by the FBI</a> in 2013 and 2014&#x2014;both cases were closed. His father, Seddique Mir Mateen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/https://www.facebook.com/seddique.mateen?fref=nf">posted a video on Facebook</a> early this morning, speaking in Dari. The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/orlando-shooting.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-abc-region&amp;region=span-abc-region&amp;WT.nav=span-abc-region&amp;_r=1">translated</a>: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what caused this. I did not know and did not understand that he has anger in his heart.&#x201D;

<p>&quot;My son, Omar Mateen, was a very good boy, an educated boy, who had a child and a wife, very respectful of his parents.&quot; </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Addressing reporters on Monday, Florida Governor Rick Scott confirmed that he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/OTA.pdf">asked President Obama</a> to declare a federal emergency on his state&apos;s behalf, so that &quot;the full resources of the federal government can be made available for all those impacted by this horrific massacre.&#x201D; Such a declaration typically prompts an initial $5 million relief grant. </p>

<p>In New York, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/http://nypost.com/2016/06/13/nypd-heightens-security-at-gay-clubs-after-orlando-massacre/">the Post reports</a> that the NYPD has announced plans to ramp up security at gay nightclubs city-wide. </p>

<p>&#x201C;We are working closely with the LGBT community to figure out exactly where we need to put our assets,&#x201D; Chief of Department James O&#x2019;Neill told reporters Monday. The NYPD will also have ample security at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111839/https://www.facebook.com/events/1004123916340523/">tonight&apos;s vigil at the Stonewall Inn</a>. <br>
