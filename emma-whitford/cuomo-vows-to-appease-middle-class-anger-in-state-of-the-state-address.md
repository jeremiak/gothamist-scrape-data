<p>During the Manhattan installment of his whirlwind State of the State tour on Monday, a hoarse and raspy Governor Cuomo managed to invoke Donald Trump over and over, without ever mentioning the President-elect by name. Throughout his 45-minute speech at One World Trade Center, the governor and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2016/11/16/buzz-begins-over-possible-cuomo-presidential-candidacy-in-2020.html">increasingly-likely</a> 2020 challenger outlined his plan to assuage what he described as &quot;middle class anger&quot; fueled by stagnant property values, college debt, and slow job growth. &quot;Misdirected, that anger can be destructive,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;It can scapegoat and demonize people who are different.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/06/great_wall_of_stupid.php">Hint, hint</a>. </p>

<p>The governor&apos;s overture to New York&apos;s middle class is, at this point, familiar: numerous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/penn_station_renovation.php#photo-1">multi-billion dollar</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/laguardia_link.php#photo-1">infrastructure</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/cuomo_jfk_airport_overhaul.php">projects</a> to create jobs, lower taxes, and hundreds of millions in grants to boost industries like the life sciences. A $163 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/03/cuomo_cuny_suny_tuition.php">plan</a> announced last week would fill the gap between state and federal scholarships to cover CUNY and SUNY tuition for students who earn $125,000 or less. </p>

<p>Cuomo also mentioned crises that have an outsize impact on New York&apos;s poorest residents: homelessness and the lack of affordable housing, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/26/de_blasios_bail_reform.php">injustice</a> in the court and prison systems. &quot;We have a record number of homeless on our streets,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;Our jails have become the mental health system of last resort.&quot; </p>

<p>But his pledge to address homelessness and housing on Monday was simply a reiteration of a plan he announced at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/state_of_the_state_cuomo.php">last year&apos;s State of the State</a>: a $20 billion 5-year plan to create 100,000 units of affordable housing, 6,000 beds of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/tag.php?term=supportivehousing&amp;page=">supportive housing</a>, and 1,000 emergency shelter beds. By June 2016, Cuomo had released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/26/cuomo_supportive_housing.php">just $150 million of the promised amount</a> in starter funding. The legislative session ended without any contractual agreement between the legislative branches as to when the rest of the funding would be released, or from where. On Monday, Cuomo blamed the delay on the Senate and Assembly. </p>

<p>&quot;The money is there, the largest state commitment in history,&quot; Cuomo promised. &quot;Neither the Assembly nor the Senate has agreed to move the funds forward. Today I call on them to advance the plan.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We need it. We need it now,&quot; he added. &quot;We need it in the winter. We need it in the cold. It is time for the state legislature to act.&quot;</p>

<p>The overture rang hollow for affordable housing advocates, citing Cuomo&apos;s ability to negotiate with Senate and Assembly leaders on pet projects&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/29/fight_for_15_first_phase_of_minimum.php">fifteen dollar minimum wage</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/04/cuomo_officially_signs_15_minimum_w.php">paid family leave</a>. &quot;This governor has managed to work with the Senate and Assembly on a whole bunch of progressive goals that were seemingly impossible because it was an important goal,&quot; Legal Aid Attorney Ellen Davidson told Gothamist. &quot;If housing were an important goal one would think he could achieve it.&quot; </p>

<p>As for criminal justice reforms, Cuomo announced a new public-private partnership with law firms to assure legal representation for immigrants. He also endorsed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/03/new_york_raise_the_age.php">raising the age of criminal liability from 16 to 18</a>&#x2014;a talking point in his annual State of the State address <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://nysbroadband.ny.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2015_Opportunity_Agenda_Book.pdf">since 2014</a>, that has continuously stalled in the Republican-led senate (the Village Voice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/governor-cuomo-wants-to-change-the-world-when-its-his-idea-9530624">recently outlined</a> how Cuomo could do more to challenge that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/https://buffalonews.com/2017/01/02/breakaway-democrats-decide-stick-gop-new-york-state-senate/">fragile Republican majority</a>.) </p>

<p>Another pledge, expanding indigent legal services for defendants across the state, came days after Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/02/cuomo_gravity_knives.php">vetoed legislation</a> that would have done just that. In his statement accompanying his veto of public defense funding, spokesman Richard Azzopardi dismissed the proposal as fiscally irresponsible&#x2014;never mind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/05/andrew_cuomo_budget_hypocrisy.php">infrastructure projects of indeterminate funding</a>.  </p>

<p>&quot;He vetoes the bill that was carefully negotiated by both houses and had bipartisan support,&quot; said Michael McKee Treasurer of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://www.tenantspac.org/">Tenants Political Action Committee</a>. &quot;And then in the next breath he proposes free tuition for middle class college students. I&apos;m not opposing free tuition. But that&apos;s all very calculated&#x2014;carefully calculated to pitch to a constituency that&apos;s going to help elect him president.&quot; </p>

<p>Other pledges made public in the last week and reiterated Monday include a childcare tax credit; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/08/same_day_voting_cuomo.php">voting reforms</a> like early voting and same-day voter registration; and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/finally_cuomo_confirms_indian_point.php">closing of the Indian Point nuclear power plant</a>. Cuomo also re-endorsed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/31/cuny_hunger_strike.php">Dream Act</a>, which would allow undocumented high school students in New York to apply for financial aid&#x2014;legislation that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/nyregion/cuomo-might-cut-dream-act-from-state-budget.html?_r=0">Cuomo dropped last year</a>, citing a lack of support in the Senate. </p>

<p>While Cuomo spoke on the 64th floor of One World Trade center, a small group of affordable housing advocates gathered on the sidewalk below. They criticized the governor for failing to address the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/cuomo_rent_albany_samo.php">current rent laws</a>, which incentivize landlords to vacate rent-stabilized apartments, steadily raising rents until they convert to market-rate units. The protesters had also hoped Cuomo would explicitly promise to release the affordable housing spending. </p>

<p>&quot;I think that if you believe in supporting the middle class, and working people in this city, the first priority should be housing,&quot; said Delsenia Glover, campaign manager for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213822/https://www.facebook.com/alliancefortenantpower/">Alliance for Tenant Power</a>, an affordable housing advocacy group. &quot;Because if middle class folks and working class and poor people can&apos;t afford to live in this city, what are you doing passing all of these middle class reforms for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think supplementing tuition is a wonderful thing,&quot; she added. &quot;I have no complaints about that. Who would? But if folks can&apos;t afford their rent, none of these programs will benefit them, because they won&apos;t be here.&quot; </p>
