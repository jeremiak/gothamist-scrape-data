<p>President Donald Trump&apos;s new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/06/trump_travel_ban_take_two.php">temporary travel ban</a> on citizens from six majority-Muslim countries, as well as refugees, only &quot;tweaks&quot; the legally dubious travel ban instated in January and will be challenged in court on the same grounds, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. </p>

<p>&quot;They have tweaked the ban, but at the end of the day they are still targeting six countries, each of which has a Muslim population of over 90 percent,&quot; said ACLU National Legal Director David Cole in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/https://www.facebook.com/aclupeoplepower/?fref=nf">live video conference Monday</a>. &quot;And that violates the Establishment Clause in the same way the original one does: it disfavors one religion.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It plays into ISIS&apos;s hands by reinforcing the storyline of the United States versus Islam,&quot; he added. &quot;National security is a pretext: The real purpose of this is to target Muslims.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In short, we&apos;ll see you in court,&quot; Cole concluded, addressing the White House. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/well-see-you-court-why-trumps-executive-order-refugees-violates-establishment">Establishment Clause</a> of the First Amendment ensures that &quot;one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another,&quot; according to the Supreme Court ruling <em>Larson v. Valente</em>. </p>

<p>Citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will all be barred from entering the US for 90 days under the new travel ban, which will go into effect on March 16th. The ban will also impact all refugees for 120 days. Applications for refugee status and visas will be temporarily suspended, as well. </p>

<p>&quot;It is the policy of the United States to keep its citizens safe from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals,&quot; a Department of Homeland Security issued Monday states. </p>

<p>The ACLU <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/right_now_hundreds_rallying_against.php">won an emergency stay</a> in Brooklyn hours after Trump&apos;s first travel ban went into effect, barring federal authorities from forcing travelers back to their countries of origin. The organization is currently challenging the first travel ban in half a dozen jurisdictions across the country, and has been recognized as a lead challenger of Trump&apos;s policies impacting immigrants, women, and transgender Americans, among others. </p>

<p>Now, the ACLU says it will amend all of its open complaints to reflect the contours of the new travel ban. For example, the new ban does not impact current green card and visa holders, or dual-citizens. It also excludes Iraq, due to the country&apos;s ally status and existing vetting processes, according to the executive order. Therefore, some of the plaintiffs challenging the original ban may &quot;no longer have standing,&quot; Cole said. </p>

<p>The new travel ban does not include a preference for Christian refugees. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-releases-new-travel-ban-executive-order-235720">Politico reports</a> that this clause giving priority to Christians was referenced often in court, as evidence of religious bias. </p>

<p>The new executive order challenges that the travel ban never provided &quot;a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion&quot; because, &quot;while that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion.&quot; </p>

<p>The new executive order, like the old one, also caps the number of refugees admitted to the US in 2017 at 50,000, down from President Obama&apos;s 110,000-per-year cap. The ACLU is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/international-refugee-assistance-project-v-trump-motion-preliminary-injunction">already challenging this provision in court</a>, on behalf of multiple refugee groups. For context, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/http://www.undispatch.com/travel-ban-executive-order-means-refugees-around-world/">about 85,000 refugees</a> were resettled in the US last year. The US has historically taken in more refugees annually than any other country in the world. </p>

<p>&quot;Refugees resettled in the US already undergo the most rigorous and lengthy security vetting process of any non-citizens entering the country,&quot; NYCLU Policy Advisor Ruthie Epstein told Gothamist, calling the cap &quot;preposterous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The revised executive order will not quell litigation or concerns,&quot; predicted Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration professor at Cornell Law School, in a statement Monday. &quot;U.S. relatives will still sue over the inability of their loved ones to join them in the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>White House officials also hinted Monday that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/06/new-travel-ban-opens-the-door-to-more-countries-on-blacklist.html">more countries could be added</a> to the ban list once the 90 day ban is up.  </p>

<p>Local elected officials denounced the new travel ban on Monday. Public Advocate Letitia James said that Trump had once again shown his &quot;true and ugly colors,&quot; while Brooklyn Council Member Jumaane Williams predicted that the ban will prompt &quot;unwarranted and unconstitutional profiling of people because of their ethnicity and race.&quot; </p>

<p>Congressman Dan Donovan, New York City&apos;s only Republican congressman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722054937/https://twitter.com/Azi/status/838803609366237184">praised the plan</a>, saying &quot;the rollout seems smoother and more controlled than the first rollout.&quot; </p>
