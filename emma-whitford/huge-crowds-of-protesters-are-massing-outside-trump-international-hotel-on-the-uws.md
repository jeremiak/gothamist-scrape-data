<p>More than a thousand people have already massed along Central Park West this afternoon for a national <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506221057/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/20/not_my_presidents_day_rally.php">Not My Presidents Day rally</a>, and the crowd is still growing on the blocks north and south of Trump International Hotel. The sun is shining, the crowd is multigenerational, and a brass band has already led the crowd through a slightly sloppy rendition of &apos;America the Beautiful.&apos;</p>

<p>There&apos;s also a contingent of about 25 Trump supporters gathered in Columbus Circle, matching chants of &quot;Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Donald Trump has go to to go!&quot; with their own, &quot;Ho, ho! Hey, hey! Donald Trump is here to stay!&quot; </p>

<p>Photographer Scott Heins says that the chants often overlap, and that a woman holding an anti-Trump sign recently used it to bonk one of the most vocal Trump supporters on the brim of his MAGA hat. Tourists are taking pictures, the crowd is peppered with knitted pink pussy hats, and several police officers have moved towards the pro-Trump contingent, but are still keeping their distance. </p>

<p>Packed at least five blocks up Central Park West from Columbus Circle, the rally is hemmed in by police barricades on both sides. Beyond the ongoing pro-Trump confrontations in Columbus Circle, Heins says the &quot;vast majority of protesters are on Central Park West waving their signs.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ll have more photos and a full report later. In the meantime, there&apos;s still time to participate: the rally is scheduled to last until about 4:00 this afternoon. <br>
