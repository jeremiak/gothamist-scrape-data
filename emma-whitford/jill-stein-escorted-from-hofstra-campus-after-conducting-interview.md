<p>Stein tweeted that she was on campus to conduct a credentialed interview with MSNBC. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101243/https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/780474117669556224">added</a>, &quot;We were immediately escorted off of the Hofstra campus after the press conference just now and told not to do any more press.&quot; </p>

<p>Stein has plans to respond to tonight&apos;s debate in real time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101243/https://twitter.com/drjillstein">on Twitter</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101243/https://www.facebook.com/drjillstein">Facebook</a>. The candidate, along with Libertarian Party Candidate Gary Johnson, was not formally invited to the debate because, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates, she failed to garner 15% of likely votes in the polls. Stein <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101243/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/26/debate_2016_live_protests.php">has countered</a> that the debates should acknowledge the 50% of Americans who don&apos;t identify as either Republican or Democrat. </p>

<p>According to Stein&apos;s campaign, the candidate is also planning to attempt to enter tonight&apos;s debate flanked by her supporters. The campaign could not immediately be reached to confirm if those plans are still on the table. </p>

<p>The Green Party candidate was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101243/http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/17/green_partys_jill_stein_cheri_honkala">arrested</a> at a presidential debate at Hofstra in 2012. </p>

<p>Hofstra did not immediately responded to a request for comment on Stein&apos;s ejection. We&apos;ll update with any additional information. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101243/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/26/debate_2016_live_protests.php">Security is tight</a> at Hofstra today, with 1,000 cops expected and about 10,000 protesters. A &quot;public assembly area&quot; has been set up for protesters, separated from the debate itself by the Hempstead Turnpike and numerous police barriers. </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 3:45]:</strong> Stein spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa told us via e-mail that, &quot;We were on campus to do pre-arranged interviews with media.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>[Update 4:30]:</strong> Figueroa told USA Today that Stein is currently waiting outside the Hofstra gates for a pre-scheduled rally at 5:30 p.m. with her supporters. &quot;Our supporters are going to attempt to escort Jill in. We are expecting they will be unsuccessful,&#x201D; Figueroa told the outlet. </p>

<p>Regardless, Stein still plans to &quot;debate&quot; with Trump and Clinton over social media. </p>
