<p>A TSA spokeswoman said that the man, identified by the Port Authority as one Chad Wiegand of Lanoka, attempted to pass through a standard security checkpoint just before 11:30 p.m. on Saturday night. A TSA officer seated at the X-ray machine discovered a .25 caliber handgun zippered case inside his backpack. It was loaded with six rounds. </p>

<p>Port Authority Police proceeded to arrest Wiegand, barring him from his scheduled flight to Hong Kong. He was subsequently charged with unlawful possession of a handgun and unlawful possession of hollow point bullets. Wiegand is currently being held on $35,000 bail. </p>

<p>A 40-year-old chiropractor from Woodstock was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426135655/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/n-y-man-caught-loaded-gun-newark-airport-cops-article-1.2258622">arrested in a similar fashion</a> at Newark in June, with a .32-caliber pistol. </p>

<p>Last November, a 94-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426135655/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/27/94-yr-old_man_found_with_loaded_gun.php">attempted to pass through security</a> at LaGuardia airport with a .38 caliber handgun clipped to his belt. And in February 2013 Da&#x2019;Quan Bowers, then a defensive end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160426135655/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/19/nfl_player_arrested_for_trying_to_b.php">headed into his TSA check</a> with a .40-caliber firearm in his carry-on. </p>

<p>In addition to criminal charges, TSA civil penalties for attempting to tote a firearm through security cap out at $11,000. <br>
