<p>Earth Day is still more than a month away&#x2014;plenty of time for New Yorkers to consider participating in a one-day, strongly-encouraged but obviously voluntary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917200625/https://twitter.com/CarFreeNYC/status/710103933683945472">ban on driving</a>. </p>

<p>Transportation Committee Chair Ydanis Rodriguez announced the April 22nd plan at NYU on Wednesday, outlining proposed road closures in three areas&#x2014;four blocks of Wadsworth Avenue in Rodriguez&apos;s own Washington Heights, the streets surrounding Washington Square Park, and Broadway in the Flatiron. Advocates were inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917200625/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/pariss-first-attempt-at-car-free-day-brings-big-drop-in-air-and-noise-pollution">similar efforts</a> in Paris, where officials conceded to shut down 30% of its streets for a day last October. &quot;While we aim to start modestly, we expect that it will grow in the coming years in both size and ambition,&quot; Rodriguez told reporters. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917200625/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/03/8593993/transportation-chair-announces-mostly-voluntary-car-free-day">According to Capital</a>, the plan is intended to highlight New Yorker&apos;s dependence on cars while forcing legislators to acknowledge so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917200625/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/02/mta_freedom_ticket_plan.php">transit deserts</a> in Southeast Queens and Staten Island. The New York Water Taxi will be free to coincide with the effort, along with some CitiBike ports. </p>

<p>The administration is apparently planning to discourage City workers from generating exhaust fumes that day, but it remains unclear whether the Mayor will trade in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917200625/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/31/de_blasio_idling_laws.php">idling SUV caravan</a>. We&apos;ve contacted his office for clarity, and will update if and when they get back to us.</p>
