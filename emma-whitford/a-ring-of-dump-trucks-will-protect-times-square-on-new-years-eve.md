<p>The same Sanitation Department sand and heavy-refuse trucks that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/08/trump_tower_garbage_wall.php#photo-1">barricaded Trump Tower</a> on election day will surround Times Square on New Years Eve, according to NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill. In total there will be 65 sanitation trucks, plus another 100 so-called &quot;blocker vehicles,&quot; or smaller NYPD vans. This new security measure&#x2014;on top of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/31/times_square_security.php#photo-1">standard</a> double-screening for ball drop viewing pens and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/31/im_wearing_a_bunch_of_pads.php#photo-4">dearth of restrooms</a>&#x2014;is a direct response to recent terror attacks on civilians in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/15/84_killed_in_france_during_bastille.php">Nice</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/20/nypd_holiday_markets.php">Berlin</a>. In both instances, a driver plowed a large vehicle into a pedestrian-heavy area. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a changing world and we have to look at what&apos;s going on,&quot; Commissioner O&apos;Neill said at a Thursday press conference. &quot;This [sanitation truck setup] is something that&apos;s going to be part of the future.&quot; He added that there are no specific threats of terrorism directed at Times Square, or New York City at large, over New Year&apos;s. </p>

<p>As in past years, ball drop crowds won&apos;t be allowed into the designated viewing pens with umbrellas, backpacks, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/new-years-eve/nye-faq/index.aspx#15">other large bags</a>. There will be about 7,000 police officers in the area, including counter-terrorism squads, additional long gun teams, and undercover officers&#x2014;about a thousand more than last year. Bomb-sniffing dogs will also be deployed in the square and throughout the subway; hundreds of surveillance cameras will cover the area. There will also be harbor and helicopter patrols.  </p>

<p>All told, the security draws a self-selecting crowd. Still nearly two million people are expected to converge on Times Square for this year&apos;s festivities, according to Chief of Department Carlos Gomez. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m not quite sure why a million people want to stand in the freezing cold for long long periods of time, but they do,&quot; Mayor de Blasio told reporters. &quot;And we will be ready for them.&quot; </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There will be hundreds of blocker vehicles, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/https://twitter.com/NYCSanitation">@NYCSanitation</a> trucks, and concrete blocks helping to protect NYE in NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/https://t.co/yo8wccl3cw">pic.twitter.com/yo8wccl3cw</a></p>&#x2014; NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/814510432119615489">December 29, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>In addition to Times Square, the NYPD will station blocker vehicles around the fireworks display in Central Park, and near festivities planned for Coney Island. For the Brooklyn New Year&apos;s Eve celebration, vehicles will be stationed along the Coney Island Boardwalk, and will block cars from driving along any of the boardwalk&apos;s access streets. </p>

<p>Sanitation trucks were also deployed along the Thanksgiving Day Parade route this year, following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/15/nypd_thanksgiving_day_parade_will_b.php">reports</a> of a possible terrorist threat. And following the Christmas market killings in Berlin, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/nypd-enlists-truck-rental-agencies-to-help-thwart-terrorists-1.12783964">said</a> that it was deploying a long-established tactic of checking with car rental agencies for &quot;suspicious&quot; renters. </p>

<p>Those efforts are continuing, according to Counterterrorism Chief James Waters. &quot;Over the last week we&apos;ve been checking parking garages, and large truck rental locations,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Official New Year&apos;s Eve street closures are forthcoming, but Chief Gomez announced one significant change over past years on Thursday. Historically, 57th and 59th Streets have remained open to traffic between 6th and 8th Avenues. This year, 57th Street will close in the early afternoon on New Year&apos;s Eve, followed by 59th Street as the viewing pens between Times Square and 59th Street begin to fill. This, on top of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/28/trump_tower_traffic_56th.php">gridlock</a> around Trump Tower. </p>

<p>If you want nothing to do with this, know that the NYPD anticipates that partiers will start converging on Times Square as early as 8:00 a.m. on Saturday. </p>

<p><strong>[Update 5:45 p.m.]:</strong> The NYPD said that the estimated NYPD security cost for New Year&apos;s Eve is $5.2 million. For context, Trump Tower security has been estimated to cost about $1 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102043058/http://new.fortune.com/2016/11/21/new-york-city-police-nypd-donald-trump-tower-security/">per day</a>. </p>
