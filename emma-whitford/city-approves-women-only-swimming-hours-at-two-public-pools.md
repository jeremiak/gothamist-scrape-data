<p>Two public swimming pools in Brooklyn will maintain weekly women-only swimming hours, following an NYC Commission on Human Rights policy review. The Parks Department confirmed Wednesday that both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014100319/https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B085/facilities/indoor-pools/metropolitan-pool">Metropolitan Pool</a> in Williamsburg and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014100319/https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/recreationcenters/B245">St. John&apos;s Recreation Center</a> in Bed-Stuy have been issued exemptions to the NYC Human Rights Law, which prohibits discrimination based on gender, race or creed. </p>

<p>Gender-segregated swim hours have been the norm at both pools for years, and were largely unchallenged until this spring, when the NYC Commission on Human Rights received <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014100319/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/27/williamsburg_pool_women_only.php">an anonymous complaint about the Metropolitan Pool</a>. </p>

<p>At Metropolitan, women-only hours will be reduced from nearly six hours per week to four&#x2014;Wednesdays from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and Sundays from 2:45 to 4:45 p.m. At St. John&apos;s, the city will eliminate a weekly two-hour men-only swim, and maintain women-only swim from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday nights. </p>

<p>Both pools serve sizeable ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, which adhere to strict modesty rules. </p>

<p>&quot;Maintaining limited women-only swim hours at these pools will allow all women to enjoy the pool without being asked to compromise their religious beliefs or affiliations and will have a minimal impact on other community members&#x2019; ability to access the pool,&quot; said Commission on Human Rights spokesman Seth Hoy in a statement. </p>

<p>Religious accommodation was not the only consideration, Parks confirmed. Histories of domestic and sexual abuse, as well as body image concerns&#x2014;to which the city deemed women and girls primarily susceptible&#x2014;were also considered. </p>

<p>&quot;Women-only swimming hours provide an important accommodation to New Yorkers who may feel more secure and comfortable in a single-sex environment,&quot; said Parks spokesman Sam Biederman in a statement Wednesday. &quot;NYC Parks is appreciative that the NYC Commission on Human Rights recognizes the need to provide such safe and fair access at public facilities.&quot; </p>

<p>Signage popped up around the Metropolitan Pool in May stating that women-only swim had been suspended, prompting an outcry from the ultra-Orthodox community. &quot;The point is about being culturally sensitive,&quot; Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind said at the time, arguing that disbanding women-only swim would be akin to banning Hasidic women from the pool altogether. </p>

<p>Other pool users countered that the policy compromised their civil rights, and simply cut down on available swim hours. </p>

<p>Parks later said that a typo in poolside signage was to blame, and confirmed that the policy was under review. Then, in early June, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014100319/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/16/bed-stuy_pool_swimming.php">nearly identical situation played out</a> at St. John&apos;s: staff posted signage indicating that gender-specific swimming hours had been suspended, then reinstated those hours following an influx of 311 complaints. Again, Parks blamed an error in the posted signage. </p>

<p>According to the Parks Department, Metropolitan and St. John&apos;s are the only two indoor pools in the city with women-only swim hours. Going forward, any indoor pool seeking an NYC Human Rights Law exemption will have to submit a 200-signature petition to the department, pitching the importance of women-only swim. </p>

<p>Women-only swim hours will be open to all who identify as such&#x2014;regardless of the gender indicated on one&apos;s state issued ID&#x2014;and petitions will not be considered if the pool in question is within &quot;reasonable&quot; distance of another pool with women-only hours. </p>

<p>City-wide, women-only swim sessions will be limited to two hours, in an effort to accommodate other pool users.  </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014100319/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyTDRb_mlo8">recent BRIC TV interview</a>, New York Civil Liberties Union Senior Staff Attorney Erin Beth Harris described the women-only swimming hours as legally compromised. </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s a reason that we have these laws, and that&apos;s because the city wants to create an open space for everybody,&quot; she said. &quot;We cannot be biased on the basis of our race, our gender, or our sex. And you can&apos;t start making individual accommodations on the basis of individual beliefs, because that&apos;s exactly what creates unequal access on a regular basis.&quot; </p>

<p>Reached on Wednesday, Harris reiterated these concerns. &quot;This undermines the purpose of the Human Rights Law,&quot; she said. &quot;You can&apos;t keep hacking away at it.&quot; </p>

<p>Harris added that the city&apos;s apparent decision to associate body image issues and sexual and domestic abuse with girls and women was &quot;paternalistic in a way that&apos;s a bit concerning.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Men are sometimes victims of that abuse,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s leading to a false dichotomy of men&apos;s and women&apos;s experiences.&quot; </p>
