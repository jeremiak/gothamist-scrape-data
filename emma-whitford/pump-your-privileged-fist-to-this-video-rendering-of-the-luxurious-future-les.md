<p>Renderings serve as a helpful reminder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040717/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/manhattan_2020_renderings.php">how unrecognizable New York City will be</a> a few years after you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040717/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/yes_philadelphia_the_one_in_pennsylvania.php">ditch all that for Philadelphia</a>, but there&apos;s something about a triumphant video rendering that&apos;s more... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040717/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/10/not_amazing_yet_srry_harlem.php">amazing</a>. </p>

<p>In what can only be interpreted as an attempt to troll Lower East Side residents still missing their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040717/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/02/extell_tower_les_chinatown.php">long-gone affordable grocery store</a>, developers Extell have shared a video rendering of their forthcoming 72-story luxury tower <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040717/http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/06/new-video-shows-252-south-streets-impact-on-the-manhattan-skyline.html">with New York YIMBY</a>. Featuring a highly motivational percussive soundtrack, the video shows a glorious glass behemoth rising up over the Manhattan Bridge like a glittering triumphant beacon to plutocrats around the world seeking tax shelters. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040717/http://therealdeal.com/2016/06/24/all-about-those-views-extell-video-shows-skyline-from-les-tower/">The Real Deal reports</a> that One Manhattan Square&#x2014;slotted to be the tallest tower between the Financial District and Midtown by 2019&#x2014;has been marketed, until now, primarily in Asia. (This shouldn&apos;t come as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040717/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/26/luxury_midtown_buildings_rife_with.php">much of a surprise</a>). The new video is apparently part of a push to attract local buyers... and repel pretty much everyone else. <br>
