<p>A 37-year-old man allegedly slashed a fellow straphanger across the chin with a knife on a northbound 3 train in Brooklyn on Monday afternoon, after throwing hot coffee onto his victim&apos;s back and shouting, &quot;Wanna fight?&quot; </p>

<p>As of this week, there have been eight reported slashings in the NYC subway. For comparison, there were three subway slashings over the same time period last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317022549/http://nypost.com/2016/02/02/another-man-slashed-on-subway/">according to the Post</a>. </p>

<p>Stephen Brathwaite approached 30-year-old Steve Jean Baptiste around 12:30 p.m. on Monday, on the northbound 3 train platform at Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York, according to the criminal complaint. Police say Brathwaite dumped his hot coffee on Baptiste, apparently without provocation, and asked him if he wanted to fight. </p>

<p>Brathwaite and Baptiste boarded the 3 train together, according to the NYPD. Between Pennsylvania Avenue and Junius Street, the next local stop, Brathwaite allegedly took a knife out of his pocket and slashed Baptiste across the chin. Brathwaite was arrested at Utica Avenue in Crown Heights just before 1:00 p.m. Police say that a knife was recovered from the 3 train at Nevins Street, three express stops away. </p>

<p>Baptiste was treated at Kings County Hospital. According to the complaint, the gash left him in &quot;substantial pain,&quot; and in fear of further injury. </p>

<p>Brathwaite was indicted Tuesday morning, and has been charged with assault, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon, and harassment. His next court date is set for February 5th. He&apos;s currently incarcerated with $2,500 bail. </p>

<p>As of late: 71-year-old Carmen Rivera was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317022549/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/d_train_slashing_suspect.php">slashed in the face</a> on a D train in Greenwich Village last Monday; 32-year-old Christopher Santiago was slashed on a 6 train as it passed through Harlem on Tuesday night; Ras Alula Nagarit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317022549/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/29/slasher_3_train_arrest.php">was arrested</a> for allegedly slashing a 29-year-old woman on a 3 train also on Tuesday night; and a 27-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317022549/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/31/man_slashed_in_the_face_at_harlem_s.php">was slashed</a> on the southbound 2 platform at the 110th Street station near Lenox Avenue early Sunday morning. </p>

<p>Hours before Baptiste was slashed, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton appeared on the John Gambling Show on AM 970, describing the uptick in subway slashings as an &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317022549/http://nypost.com/2016/02/01/nypds-bratton-subway-slashings-are-an-aberration/">aberration</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m quite comfortable that this increase in slashings that we saw on the subway and in fact a small increase in the city overall, is an aberration,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll deal with it, and as we go forward in the year those numbers will decline.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Speaking at a Manhattan South Compstat meeting last week, NYPD brass said they were interested in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317022549/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/30/nypd_reportedly_wants_to_ban_career.php">pitching the MTA a plan</a> that would ban &quot;career criminals&quot; from the subway. </p>
