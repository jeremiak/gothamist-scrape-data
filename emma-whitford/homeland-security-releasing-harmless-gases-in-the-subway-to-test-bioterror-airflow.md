title: Homeland Security Releasing "Harmless" Gases In The Subway To Test Bioterror Airflow
---

	
										<p>Today through Friday, Homeland Security and MTA researchers will release nontoxic gases and particles into the air inside some of the city&apos;s most crowded subway stations to test how quickly poison would permeate the system in the case of a biological terrorist attack involving, say, mustard gas or anthrax. </p>

<p>The MTA and Homeland Security have already held two media availabilities on the airflow study&#x2014;at Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal&#x2014;exposing reporters to the substances and reiterating their benign composition. Given the MTA&apos;s daily chorus of &quot;see something, say something,&quot; this sort of public experiment definitely merits an explanation. </p>

<p>Gases and tracer particles will be released throughout the week at Times Square, Penn Station and Grand Central. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2016/05/6/mta--homeland-security-gas-attack-test-preview.html">NY1 reports</a> that about 200 toaster-sized filters will be set up at about 50 subway stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, to detect any trace amounts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/dhs-will-test-bioterror-airflow-in-nyc-subway.html">Daily Intel reports</a> that researchers will disperse throughout the system wearing reflective orange vests and special patches designed to collect the particles, which are sugar-based and similar in composition to Splenda. </p>

<p>&quot;The particles we release will have a... very small amount of fluorescent material,&quot; Dr. David Brown of the Argon National Labs, which is helping conduct the study, told reporters last week. &quot;So, it can pick up that fluorescent material and discriminate that against all the other particles that are in the subway.&quot;</p>

<p>Researchers are using a new technology called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/https://www.llnl.gov/news/tracing-tainted-food-back-its-source">DNATrax</a>, which gives particles an identifying feature not dissimilar to a barcode. </p>

<p>The City conducted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/its_day_2_of_nypds_harmless_gas-in-.php">similar test</a> in July 2013, releasing low concentrations of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/nypd_to_inject_harmless_gas_into_su.php">harmless</a>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://www.ec.gc.ca/toxiques-toxics/Default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=98E80CC6-1&amp;xml=AA329670-C3C7-4AD5-A7AB-5FD8A05439F1">perfluorocarbons [PFCs]</a> at central subway stations and tracking their dissemination. Some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/chemical_used_in_harmless_subway_ga.php">rogue pamphleteers</a> warned straphangers that the gases, which authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/its_day_2_of_nypds_harmless_gas-in-.php">insisted are benign</a>, have been linked to early menopause. Also found in microwave popcorn linings and Teflon-coated frying pans, scientists say the known greenhouse gasses are harmless in trace amounts, and have been used since the 70s to study how particles move through the atmosphere. </p>

<p>&quot;These inert gases are safe for our customers and employees, and the entire test will be performed with no impact on them and no interruption to service,&quot; MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F. Prendergast said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221222123/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/homeland_security_to_test_airflow_in_nyc_subways_i.html">in a statement</a>. &quot;We are fully committed to keeping our nearly six million daily subway customers safe and secure, and this test will bolster the MTA and our partners&apos; ability to protect them and the city at large.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, move along sheeple! </p>
