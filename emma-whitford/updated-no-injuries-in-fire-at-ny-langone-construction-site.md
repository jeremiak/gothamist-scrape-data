<p><strong>[Update 3:00]:</strong> NYU Langone issued an updated statement. The cause of the fire is still unconfirmed: </p>

<blockquote>Earlier today, a fire broke out on the seventh floor rooftop at NYU Langone Medical Center&#x2019;s construction site for its new hospital building, which is scheduled to open in 2018. The fire was confined to the construction site and was extinguished at approximately 12:45 PM. During this time, hospital operations did not cease.  As a precaution, some patients in rooms on the north side of Tisch Hospital facing the construction were moved to the south side of the floor. They have since been located back to their rooms. Currently we are investigating cause and the extent of damage.</blockquote>
