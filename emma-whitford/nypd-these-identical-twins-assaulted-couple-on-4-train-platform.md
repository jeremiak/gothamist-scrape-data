<p>Identical twin brothers beat a woman unconscious and punched her boyfriend in the head earlier this month inside the Grand Concourse 4 train station in the Bronx, according to the NYPD. One of the brothers, Darnell Brown, was arrested Thursday and charged with assault and gang assault. Cops are still seeking his brother, Terrell. </p>

<p>Police said that the Brown brothers began harassing a 28-year-old woman on the 149th Street Grand Concourse platform shortly before 6:00 a.m. on Monday, September 5th. The woman&apos;s boyfriend intervened, and one of the Brown brothers allegedly put the 21-year-old man in a headlock, while the other punched him &quot;numerous times&quot; in the head and torso. The girlfriend then attempted to stop the assault, according to the police, prompting one of the Browns to punch her in the face. The woman fell to the ground unconscious, and sustained face lacerations. Her boyfriend sustained facial fractures. Both were treated at Lincoln Hospital. </p>

<p>In the below graphic video of the assault, Darnell is wearing braids and a T-shirt with &quot;No Bad Vibes&quot; written across the front. Terrell, who remains at large, is about 5-feet-10 and weighs 165 pounds.</p>
