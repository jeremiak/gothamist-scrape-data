<p>The Department of Transportation today released the digital version of its 2016 cycling map, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bikemaps.shtml">view online</a> and download before the version that absorbs coffee stains goes into circulation next month. While recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/15/judge_revives_prospect_park_west_bi.php">courtroom</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/03/amsterdam_ave_bike_lane.php">community board</a> drama has proven that New York in 2016 still hasn&apos;t <em>quite</em> decided if bike lanes are unequivocally a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/22/measured_bike_lane_feedback.php">good idea</a>, this year&apos;s map proudly boasts 70 new or &quot;upgraded&quot; bike-specific lane miles, twelve of which are protected. The map also includes seven miles of new off-street bike lanes, including a stretch of the Springville Greenway on the eastern edge of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/28/freshkills_dump_now_park.php">Freshkills Park</a> in Staten Island. </p>

<p>The DOT is promising <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/protected_bike_lanes.php">a record</a> 15 fresh miles of protected bike lanes in the coming year&#x2014;on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://www.streetsblog.org/2015/03/13/cb-2-panel-signs-off-on-dot-proposal-for-bruckner-blvd-protected-bikeway/">Bruckner Boulevard</a> in the Bronx, for example, and Amsterdam Avenue and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/07/bike_lane_chrystie_street.php">Chrystie Street</a> in Manhattan. And a new proposal for protected bike lanes on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/bike_lanes_brooklyn.php">Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn</a> is part of the DOT&apos;s effort to not just generate new lanes, but connect them along logical commuter routes as well (in this case, a protected commute to Midtown from Brooklyn across the Manhattan Bridge). </p>

<p>But just like you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/https://twitter.com/placardabuse">can&apos;t trust a municipal worker</a>, you probably shouldn&apos;t trust the bike map, in its entirety, with your life. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for the DOT said that the department is aware of a few alleged errors on the map (another being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/https://twitter.com/BrooklynSpoke/status/714518345266151425">misinformation about car travel</a> in Prospect Park) and is &quot;looking into it.&quot; </p>

<p>In the meantime, be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040931/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/16/bike_lane_block_map.php">safe out there</a>, y&apos;all. </p>
