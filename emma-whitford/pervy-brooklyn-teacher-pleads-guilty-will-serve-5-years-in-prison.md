A flood of accusations of sexual misconduct followed&#x2014;having sex with underage students, asking underage students to engage in lesbian sex with each other, and taking an underage student to a nude beach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613235405/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/01/brooklyn_teacher_allegedly_took_stu.php">and a sex club</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613235405/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/04/mom_says_teen_was_infatuated_with_p.php">among other</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613235405/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/19/pervy_brooklyn_tech_teacher_wore_cr.php">things</a>. <p></p>

<p>Shaynak was ultimately accused of abusing seven young women ranging in age from 14 to 18. And on Tuesday, in the wake of a 36 count indictment, Shaynak pleaded guilty to crimes corresponding with a five year prison sentence. </p>

<p>Shaynak pleaded guilty this week to kidnapping in the second degree, related to the time he took a 15-year-old female student across state lines to a nude beach in New Jersey, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613235405/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/nyregion/ex-brooklyn-teacher-accused-of-abusing-7-girls-pleads-guilty-to-kidnapping.html">the NY Times reports</a>. He also pleaded guilty to disseminating indecent material to a minor, endangering the welfare of a child and official misconduct.</p>

<p>Other charges in the indictment included obscenity and sexual abuse, and spelled up to 25 years in prison. But a law enforcement official who discussed the case with the NY Times on condition of anonymity said that many of the alleged victims refused to testify in court, and one withdrew her cooperation completely. </p>

<p>&quot;This guilty plea spares the young victims from having to testify publicly at trial and in graphic detail,&quot; said Oren Yaniv, a spokesman for the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office, in a statement.  &quot;In addition to five years in prison, the defendant is now a violent predicate felon who must register as a sex offender and will never be allowed to teach again.&quot; </p>

<p>One of Shaynak&apos;s alleged victims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613235405/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/13/sean_shaynak_doe.php">filed suit</a> against the Department of Education earlier this year, a few months after the city issued a report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613235405/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/20/sean_shaynak.php">justifying its decision to hire Shaynak</a>, despite the fact that he had been arrested in 2005 for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613235405/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/02/pervy_brooklyn_tech_teacher.php">allegedly beating up an 11-year-old</a>. </p>

<p>Referred to in the filing as V.V., the victim issued a statement when her suit went public. </p>

<p>&quot;As a teacher, he was very cool to hang out with and talk to,&quot; she said. &quot;I can totally understand how the other girls could look up to him. I feel like I was used. If I had a chance to sit down and talk to him, I would tell him what he did was sick and he should have stopped when I told him to stop.&quot;</p>
