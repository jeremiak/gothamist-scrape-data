<p>NYPD officers on Monday arrested a 53-year-old homeless man in connection with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/15/man_found_dead_with_neck_laceration.php">fatal stabbing</a> inside of a Kips Bay men&apos;s homeless shelter on Friday morning. The suspect, William Smith, was charged with murder. </p>

NYPD officials confirmed last week that they were questioning all 67 men who had been on that floor at the time of the incident. The 30th Street Men&apos;s Intake Shelter at 400 East 30th Street, also known as Bellevue Shelter, is the intake center for all NYC men who are new to the system, or are returning after a minimum six-month hiatus.<p></p>

<p>Friday&apos;s stabbing was the latest in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/29/homeless_man_fatally_stabs_roommate.php">rash</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/hotel_stabbing_ramada_homeless.php">violent deaths</a> at NYC shelters that have prompted Mayor de Blasio to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/security-increased-after-fatal-stabbing-at-new-york-homeless-shelter/">revamp</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/staten_island_homeless_stabbing.php">security measures</a>. &quot;This incident is exactly why we are working with NYPD to improve shelter security,&quot; Steven Banks, the City&apos;s newly-appointed Commissioner of Social Services, told reporters last week. </p>

<p>The NYPD is also investigating Smith&apos;s connection to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/16/livery_cab_driver_slashed_by_passen.php">robbery attempt</a> in Queens over the weekend. According to the department, police officers responded to 5840 Van Cleef Street near the Horace Harding Expressway in Corona around 12:30 a.m. on Saturday. There, they discovered a 43-year-old livery cab driver with slash marks on his back and neck. </p>

<p>The driver had allegedly dropped off his passenger on Van Cleef Street near the Corona Holiday Inn and asked for a fare, at which point the passenger demanded the driver&apos;s money and allegedly slashed him before fleeing the scene. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/nyregion/manarrestedin-fatal-stabbing-at-manhattan-homeless-shelter.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur">The NY Times reports</a> that the suspect left behind his cellphone and wallet, with ID that matched Smith. </p>

<p>Smith was arrested at the corner of Ditmars Boulevard and 31st Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420001719/http://nypost.com/2016/04/18/cops-arrest-suspect-in-homeless-shelter-killing-livery-driver-slashing/">according to the Post</a>. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing.  </p>
