					<p>A Brooklyn-based, 30-something performance artist who claims to have conceived, commissioned and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314142544/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/27/photo_you_can_visit_donald_trumps_t.php">planted the Donald Trump tombstone</a> that stood in Central Park for a few hours on Easter Sunday morning spoke with us on the condition of anonymity on Friday, insisting that he/she was by no stretch playing an April Fools joke on us. The artist, X (he/she asked that we not disclose his/her gender for fear of identification, so we&apos;ll use the gender-neutral pronoun &quot;ze&quot; moving forward), said that ze wanted to set the record straight on the concept&#x2014;a &quot;political satire and a guerrilla art piece&quot;&#x2014;and denounce a narrative that X says &quot;right wing publications&quot; are propagating, that the tombstone was planted as a death threat. </p>

<p>Soon after the stone was removed from Central Park, around 9:00 a.m. last Sunday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314142544/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tombstone-found-central-park/story?id=37976495">ABC reported</a> that it was &quot;unclear&quot; whether the Secret Service had gotten involved, much less whether the agency considered the tomb a death threat. They did, however, speak to a Secret Service spokesman (&quot;We&apos;re not going to comment on protective procedures or protective knowledge like that&quot;). </p>

<p>&quot;For a day or two I was staring out my windows seeing if someone was tracking me,&quot; X said on Friday. &quot;I want to make [the truth] known so that I don&apos;t get pulled into a van and questioned and interrogated. I watch a lot of movies.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="040216_Trump.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314142544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/040216_Trump.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> The stone shortly after it was planted on Easter Sunday morning (Molly Krause Communications). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>X said that it took 5 months to plan for and execute the headstone, which depicts Trump&apos;s name over the epitaph &quot;Made America Hate Again.&quot; </p>

<p>The project is tentatively called the Legacy Stone, and the timing, Easter Sunday, was apparently intentional. &quot;It&apos;s the day Jesus was resurrected, and the point is to have [Trump] remember his legacy,&quot; X said. &quot;There are some poetic ties.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="040116_Trump`.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314142544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/040116_Trump%60.jpeg" width="320" height="427"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> The artist&apos;s alleged design (Molly Krause Communications). </i></div> &quot;I&apos;ve seen a lot of different pieces in the art world come out about [Trump], but I thought they were surface level in a way,&quot; X added, calling out Hanksy&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314142544/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/28/trumpe_loeil.php">Dump Trump</a> likeness in particular. According to X, the tombstone was meant to hit Trump on an existential level. &quot;I was trying to find a way where I could literally connect to Donald and say, &apos;Wake up man,&apos;&quot; X said. &quot;I was trying to get him to understand what he would be remembered for at this point.&quot; Asked if X was intentionally mimicking Ebeneezer Scrooge&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314142544/https://www.google.com/search?q=Scrooge+tombstone&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=92S-dWyqxifinM%253A%253BjmGB5C9uXRR8_M%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.mcfta.org%25252Fscrooge-tombstone1%25252F&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=92S-dWyqxifinM%253A%252CjmGB5C9uXRR8_M%252C_&amp;usg=__VjxKDhhfLsAtFtiJwlU2x-VaYgI%3D&amp;biw=1217&amp;bih=785&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw3_KBru7LAhVHx4MKHadSDSMQyjcIKg&amp;ei=5uT-VvDUGMeOjwSnpbWYAg#imgrc=92S-dWyqxifinM%3A">moment of reckoning</a> in <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, X laughed and said ze was not but, &quot;You&apos;re not the first person to mention that to me.&quot; <p></p>

<p>X said that the stone was purchased from a tombstone shop in the New York City Metropolitan Area. The cross and flowers had apparently been carved into the stone in the 1970s, and Trump&apos;s name, birthdate and epitaph were carved for this project, on commission (X is not a stonecutter). The engraving took a month and was financed, according to X, by &quot;collectors and backers&quot; who have &quot;supported me in the past&quot; and don&apos;t necessarily have a &quot;political motivation.&quot; The stone apparently weighed a thousand pounds, meaning it took &quot;a lot of effort&quot; to get it into place. </p>

<p>As for the logistics of the project, X claims to have rented a moving van with a lift gate around 2:30 a.m. on Easter Sunday. X and four accomplices loaded the stone into the van, and drove to the edge of Central Park, arriving around 4:00 a.m. (X asked that the make of the van and the parking location be withheld, citing the possibility of identification by security camera). Central Park was a logical location for the stone for two reasons, X said&#x2014;beyond its proximity to Trump Tower, &quot;Central Park&quot; is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314142544/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9fe92e13ee404ab9bdd86699b20d4f0e/trademarked-trump-makes-money-name-central-park">Trump trademark</a>. </p>

<p>The group allegedly lowered the stone to the ground and mounted it on to a refrigerator dolly with two wheels and straps so that X could roll it into the park. &quot;I stopped quite a bit,&quot; X recalled, clarifying that the group stuck to paved pathways because the stone was so heavy. &quot;It was a very labor intensive process, but I had people telling me the coast was clear.&quot; </p>

<p>X clarified that the four accomplices had walkie talkies, and that the only other people they saw in the park that morning were a few joggers, none of whom stopped to ask questions. The stone was finally planted around 5:30, on the north side of Sheepshead Meadow near Tavern On The Green. X says the spot was selected during a scouting trip, since the fence nearby had already been broken once and wired back together&#x2014;X used wire cutters to snap it open.   </p>

<p>Once the stone was planted, X says that the group left the park to return the moving van. X then headed back to the park alone to &quot;watch from a distance and see how long it was going to stay, and see the response.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it would be up longer,&quot; X said, of the tombstone&apos;s Sunday morning removal. X claims to have been in the park, nearby, around 9:00 a.m., watching as the stone was removed. As of this week, X has no idea where the tombstone is. </p>

<p>&quot;NYC Parks removed the tombstone shortly after it was discovered Sunday,&quot; a spokeswoman for the department stated on Saturday. Parks has been monitoring the location since then, but deferred all questions about an investigation to the NYPD. </p>

<p>Reached for comment, a spokesman for the NYPD said that the stone was discovered by Central Park Conservancy personnel between 7:30 and 7:40 a.m. on Sunday March 27th, near the intersection of 72nd Street and Cross Drive. According to the NYPD, the tombstone was deemed a &quot;political statement,&quot; and there is no further investigation underway. He suggested the Conservancy might know where the stone is, but a spokesperson for that group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>

<p>X wouldn&apos;t disclose a presidential candidate of choice on Friday, but did claim to be a registered independent. &quot;I try to go with whoever is best serving the people,&quot; X said. &quot;But I would say I&apos;m leaning more towards the left.&quot; </p>
