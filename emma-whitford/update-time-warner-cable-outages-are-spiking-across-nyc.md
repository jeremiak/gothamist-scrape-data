<p>Time Warner Cable is working to address system-wide issues impacting TV, internet and phone service across New York City and, according to the company, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103135/https://twitter.com/TWC_Help/status/729762446995382274">surrounding areas</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>TWC confirmed the service issues around 3:20 p.m. The company has yet to respond to our request for comment on the full scope of the outages, or what may have caused them. We will update with any additional information. <strong>[See below for update.]</strong></p>

<p>For those using their smartphones to access Twitter (or who are stealing a neighbor&#x2019;s FIOS WiFi),  the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103135/https://twitter.com/TWC_Help/with_replies">TWC Help Twitter account</a> is extremely active at the moment. The company recently tweeted out that, &quot;Local management and technicians are attempting to correct the issue in NYC at this time. Unfortunately, we [have] not be provided with an ETA to correct this issue.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ll keep you updated. In the meantime, some advice: </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 10:00 p.m.:]</strong> Today&apos;s wide-spread service outages were the result of fiber cuts at one of TWC&apos;s network providers, according to TWC spokesman Eric Mangan. Service was restored to NYC customers as of 8:45 p.m. on Monday. </p>

<p>&quot;Multiple fiber cuts at one of our network providers are affecting TWC phone and some TV services in the New York City area,&quot; Mangan confirmed around 5:00 p.m. &quot;We are in continual contact with the provider on its repairs and we have restored additional TV networks through our own facilities. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation has caused our customers.&quot;</p>
