<p>The driver of a black SUV was shot in the head in Astoria, Queens early Friday morning and rammed into a utility pole, according to the NYPD. The driver was reportedly making a pickup for a livery service when he was shot, but the Taxi and Limousine Commission could not immediately confirm if the driver was registered with a platform. He remains in critical condition. </p>

<p>Police responded to the intersection of 35th Street and 37th Avenue shortly before 5:00 a.m. on Friday. There, they discovered the unidentified driver slumped in the front seat with a bullet wound to the head. The front end of his Ford Explorer was crushed, apparently after striking a utility pole. There were no suspects on the scene, and the driver was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital. </p>
