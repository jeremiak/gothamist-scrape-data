<p>Nearly one semester after the city implemented a rezoning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/9ABFF4D4-9CBE-4C75-8016-A269D3993538/0/D13_Rezoning_Official_Presentation_112315_vFinalshare.pdf">plan</a> in Brooklyn that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/22/dumbo_school_rezoning_fight.php">garnered</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/nyregion/race-and-class-collide-in-a-plan-for-two-brooklyn-schools.html?_r=0">widespread</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/magazine/choosing-a-school-for-my-daughter-in-a-segregated-city.html">attention</a> as a litmus test for integration, Department of Education data shows that one of the two schools it targeted has not seen a significant change in composition. </p>

<p>Back in January, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/CEC/GPInformation/CommunityEducationCouncils/one.htm">elected group</a> of parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/brooklyn_school_integration.php">voted</a> to carve incoming kindergarten and pre-k parents living in DUMBO out of PS 8&#x2014;a predominantly white upper-middle-class school in Brooklyn Heights. The goal was to eliminate a kindergarten <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/74263">wait-list</a> at PS 8, while increasing enrollment at nearby PS 307 in Vinegar Hill, a small school that serves mostly low-income black and Latino children. </p>

<p>The plan was immediately controversial. Some DUMBO parents expressed concern about PS 307&apos;s location&#x2014;it&apos;s across the street from the NYCHA-run Farragut Houses&#x2014;and about its history of low test scores. And some Farragut parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/schools_brooklyn_race_class.php">argued</a> that the plan overlooked &quot;obvious racial tensions,&quot; and could reverse their efforts to focus on the needs of minority students. </p>

<p>At the time, the DOE said it didn&apos;t expect immediate change at PS 307: either a spike in overall enrollment, or a dramatic increase in white students. &quot;The at-scale impact of this rezoning will take place after several years,&quot; DOE spokesman Will Mantell reiterated this month.</p>

<p>So far, there hasn&apos;t been a large shift in demographics at PS 307 in the grades impacted by the rezoning. Last school year, there were 10 white students out of 36 students in 307&apos;s pre-k and fewer than 10 out of 69 students in kindergarten. (For privacy reasons, the DOE reports single-digit populations as &quot;under 10.&quot;) Preliminary DOE data from this year shows that as of October 31, there were fewer than 10 white students out of 47 in the pre-k class and fewer than 10 out of 58 in the kindergarten.</p>

<p>Education experts said it&apos;s difficult to draw conclusions from the new data. &quot;These aren&apos;t big numbers to begin with, so it&apos;s hard to say what&apos;s a meaningful decrease or increase,&quot; said Adriana Villavicencio, deputy director at NYU&apos;s Research Alliance for New York City Schools. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t hang my hat on anything quite yet.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="121416_3072.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/121416_3072.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Emma Whitford / Gothamist) </i></div> <p></p>

<p>The waitlist at PS 8, meanwhile, has been eliminated. The kindergarten class has 115 students, according to the DOE (PS 8 does not have a pre-k program). It is unclear how many students zoned out of PS 8 went to 307 and how many chose some alternative. The DOE pointed out that DUMBO pre-k parents have another new option this year at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/https://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2016/1/29/dumbos-dock-street-middle-school-open-sept-2016">Dock Street</a>. </p>

<p>Halley Potter, a fellow with the Century Foundation who studies diversity in pre-k, said further integration of PS 307 will depend, in part, on how DUMBO parents feel this first year of rezoning went. &quot;If the community perceives a pretty successful first year for families that are new to 307, and word spreads, you might see next year an uptick in newly-zoned parents opting to attend,&quot; she said. &quot;If the lines are redrawn but the families newly zoned to 307 simply aren&apos;t opting to attend, then that would suggest that there is a lot more work to be done.&quot;</p>

<p>DUMBO resident and PS 307 mother Eliza Porter, who is white, said she thinks parents in her neighborhood are warming to the school. &quot;The buzz that I&apos;m hearing from families a little bit younger is at least go tour it,&#x201D; Porter said. &quot;Go look at it first before you make any decisions. Because touring it could change the biases that you have based on its location.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If parents&apos; experiences are positive, the word spreads,&quot; said David Goldsmith, president of Community Education Council 13, which voted on the rezoning last fall. His daughter attended PS 8 in the early 2000s, when it had a similar demographic to PS 307. &quot;I remember a time when we had to beg people to go to PS 8, and people were saying, &apos;No, no, no,&apos; and five years later people were saying, &apos;Don&apos;t you have some kind of in?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We recognize and value the importance of continuing to engage families throughout this process,&quot; said Mantell, the DOE spokesman. PS 307 Principal Stephanie Carroll has brought in a Teachers College program called The Public Good, intended to help teachers and parents ease the transition to a more racially diverse student body. Earlier this spring, Carroll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161218212355/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/09/rezoning_update.php">outlined her efforts</a> to draw more students to the school, including meet-ups for incoming pre-k students and a more navigable website. </p>

<p>Kadesha Brimby, a black resident of the Farragut Houses and PS 307 alum, said she had conflicting feelings. &quot;It&apos;s nice to see new faces, but don&apos;t forget about the old faces,&quot; she said. &quot;Don&apos;t put all your priorities into what&apos;s going in.&quot;</p>
