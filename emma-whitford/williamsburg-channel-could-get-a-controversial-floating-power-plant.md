<p>A Manhattan-based developer has acquired the necessary permits to install a floating power plant the size of a luxury yacht in a narrow channel along the southern end of Kent Avenue in Williamsburg, near the South Williamsburg East River Ferry terminal. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/18/dtg-wallabout-floating-power-plant-2016-04-29-bk.html">First reported by the Brooklyn Paper</a>, the deal is awaiting approval from the Army Corps of Engineers, which has pledged to accept comments on the proposal until April 30th. </p>

<p>Robert Perris of Brooklyn&apos;s Community Board 2 told us today that he heard about the proposal secondhand, in early April&#x2014;even though Sef Industries (a.k.a. NYC Energy LLC) filed an application for the barge&apos;s installation back in 2013. &quot;This might have flown under the radar without any discourse about whether it&apos;s appropriate or not,&quot; he said. &quot;We weren&apos;t provided with any information [by the Army Corps of Engineers].&quot; </p>

<p>The proposed 220-foot-by-100-foot barge would fill approximately half the width of Wallabout Channel on the northeastern edge of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and rise six stories, according to a notice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://www.nan.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/RegulatoryPublicNotices/tabid/4166/Article/710098/nan-2016-00062-eya.aspx">posted in late March</a> by the Army Corps of Engineers. (For the less-imaginative, Brownstoner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://www.brownstoner.com/development/williamsburg-brooklyn-power-plant-floating-sef-industries-wallabout/">whipped up a rendering</a>.) It would be moored on steel pipe piles, and would require the installation of 750 feet of utility pipeline about 40 feet below the low-tide line. </p>

<p>The floating 79.9 MW power plant would provide emergency electricity in the case of a &quot;catastrophic loss of power&quot; in New York City prompted by a natural disaster or terrorist attack, according to Sef&apos;s 2013 application [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/file:///Users/gothamist2015a/Downloads/%7B1D0C9F58-F966-4957-A498-C2D41C42EF95%7D.pdf">PDF</a>]. Sef also made the case that the floating plant would displace &quot;less efficient, higher polluting&quot; generators elsewhere. But locals have countered that the barge will generate noise and air pollution. A similar barge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/generator_explosion_barge_fire_resp.php">exploded in Sunset Park</a> in August of 2012. </p>

<p>The plant would produce enough energy to power about 79,000 homes, according to Brownstoner. But at 79.9 MW, it&apos;s <em>just</em> below the 80 MW threshold that triggers a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://www.gothamgazette.com/environment/jan.01.shtml">lengthy environmental review process</a>. </p>

<p>A coalition of locals called Stop The Barge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/barge-generator-track-foes-article-1.913256">won a lawsuit</a> against Sef back in 2001, over a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://www.dec.ny.gov/enb/12163.html">similar proposal</a> for a barge in the Wallabout Channel. The proposal was tabled after the coalition made the case that Sef hadn&apos;t done an adequate environmental review. </p>

<p>There&apos;s also the NIMBY aspect, as the barge would be within sight lines of the yet-to-be-developed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/first_look_at_renderings_for_the_ne.php">Domino Sugar Factory</a>. &quot;Imagine being in a building when you have power plant stacks in front of your window,&quot; Stop The Barge member Kathleen Gilrain told the Brooklyn Paper this week. </p>

<p>Senator Daniel Squadron, Councilmember Steve Levin and other local pols sent a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers earlier this week, asking for an extended comment period on the barge, and a public hearing to discuss its implications. </p>

<p>&quot;The concerns raised by the idea of placing a floating power plant in this location go on and on, and the amount of information available is disturbingly limited,&quot; said Squadron in a statement. </p>

<p>Sef could not be immediately reached for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers did not immediately respond to a request either, but their public notice on the proposal says the permitting decision will consider &quot;impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest.&quot; The corp&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231948/http://www.nan.usace.army.mil/Contact.aspx">Manhattan office</a> is accepting feedback through Saturday. </p>
