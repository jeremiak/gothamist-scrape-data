<p>About 20 straphangers were stranded on Wednesday afternoon when an elevator that lifts riders from the Court Street subway station to street level in Brooklyn Heights got stuck mid-trip. As a commuter who used to ride subway elevators twice daily, this falls into my bucket of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220726/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/02/how_to_fear_like_a_real_nyer.php">NYC nightmares</a>. But at least one rider caught in the lurch escaped mentally unscathed. <br>
 <br>
&quot;No one visibly panicked which made a huge difference,&quot; wrote Rachel Jo Silver, 33, in a message to Gothamist on Thursday. &quot;TBH I think the fact that we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220726/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/31/mta_subway_wifi.php">had wifi</a> was a big deal. Everyone could text and let people know where they were.&quot; (Also call 911, though there&apos;s also a call button for that.) </p>

<p>The FDNY responded to the R train Court Street station at the corner of Clinton and Montague Streets around 4:15 p.m., according to the department, and managed to extract everyone from the elevator uninjured. </p>

<p>Silver said that the group had been waiting for about half an hour when two firefighters cut a hole in the elevator ceiling and descended down a ladder into the cramped space. Everyone on board proceeded to climb up the ladder, and a second five-foot ladder to street level, where they exited through the sliding elevator door. </p>

<p>&quot;My biggest take away TBH is that the fireman were so nice and amazing and I generally feel safer about NYC now,&quot; Silver said. </p>

<p>The MTA didn&apos;t immediately comment on the incident, but the elevator in question is out of service for repairs until Friday, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220726/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/20-people-stranded-brooklyn-subway-elevator-article-1.2949934">the Daily News</a>. All&apos;s well that ends well. </p>
