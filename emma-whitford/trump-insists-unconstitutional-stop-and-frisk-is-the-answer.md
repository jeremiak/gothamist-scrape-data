<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump punctuated his chant of <em>Law and order! Law and order!</em> during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/debate_takeaways.php#photo-1">Monday night&apos;s presidential debate</a> with swiftly-debunked claims about the impact of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk</a>&#x2014;a Giuliani and Bloomberg-era policy that Trump claimed &quot;brought the crime rate way down&quot; in New York City. Crime has actually decreased in recent years as the policy of detaining, questioning, and searching civilians has sharply declined&#x2014;a fact that Mayor Bill de Blasio; NYPD spokesman J. Peter Donald; and a slew of local activists and beat reporters were quick to quantify. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/22/donald-trump-claims-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-policy-reduced-crime-the-data-disagree/">recent Washington Post analysis</a> shows how violent crime was already on the decline when stop-and-frisks spiked under former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly in the early 2000s. A New York Civil Liberties Union analysis from 2015 punches more holes in Trump&apos;s claim that stop-and-frisk &quot;worked very well in New York&quot;&#x2014;the NYPD&apos;s own statistics show that black and Latino New Yorkers are overwhelmingly targeted by the practice, and that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://www.nyclu.org/content/stop-and-frisk-data">close to nine out of ten stops between 2002 and 2015 were deemed innocent</a>. </p>

<p>As for Trump&apos;s claim that &quot;murders are up&quot; in New York City this year, the NYPD counters that NYC is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/https://twitter.com/JPeterDonald/status/780611802338033664">down 16 homicides compared to last year</a>. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Crime_2016_Preliminary_Analysis.pdf">recent report from the Brennan Center for Justice</a> acknowledges that &quot;annual increases and decreases are normal, and generally do<br>
not indicate underlying trends.&quot; That being said, murders have been trending down since 1990. </p>

<p>In the case of Chicago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://chicagoist.com/2016/09/27/trump_chicago.php">a program similar to stop-and-frisk failed</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/police-data-cast-doubt-on-chicagostyle-stopandfrisk/d79738c6-b5a2-494d-acaf-e659969b3e6b">WBEZ reports</a> that as stops increased, &quot;Gun seizures dropped, detectives solved fewer murders, and a decade-long decline in gun violence ended.&quot;</p>

<p>Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/federal_judge_stop_frisk_violates_u.php">ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional</a> in 2013&#x2014;a fact Trump was unwilling to swallow on Monday without qualification. Here&apos;s the exchange: </p>

<blockquote>Lester Holt: Stop and Frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.

<p>Trump: No, you&apos;re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it throughout the country, there are many places where...</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In fact, as NPR Whitehouse Correspondent Scott Horsley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://www.npr.org/2016/09/26/495115346/fact-check-first-presidential-debate">points out</a>, &quot;Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional by a federal district judge. The city appealed, and after a change of mayor the case was settled before the appeal.&quot; </p>

<p>But court processes aside, the outsize impact of stop-and-frisk on minority groups is indisputable. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/federal_judge_stop_frisk_violates_u.php">Scheindlin&apos;s decision</a>, the judge admonishes a racist policy. &quot;&#x202A;In their zeal to defend a policy that they&#x202C; &#x202A;believe to be effective, they [the NYPD] have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of&#x202C; &#x202A;targeting &apos;the right people&apos; is racially discriminatory and therefore violates the United States&#x202C; &#x202A;Constitution,&quot; she writes. </p>

<p>Trump&apos;s own endorsement of stop-and-frisk on Monday was peppered with racist assumptions. &quot;We have gangs roaming the street and in many cases they&apos;re illegally here, illegal immigrants,&quot; he said. &quot;And they have guns and they shoot people.&quot; </p>

<p>Trump also alleged that violent crime is up nation-wide. &quot;We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African-American, Hispanics, are living in hell because it&apos;s so dangerous,&quot; Trump said. &quot;You walk down the street, you get shot.&quot; </p>

<p>The FBI did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/home">publish statistics</a> yesterday that show murders increased 11% in 2015. The caveat, though, is that rates are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105525/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/26/495460107/fbi-violent-crime-rose-slightly-in-2015-murders-up-nearly-11-percent">significantly lower</a> than they were 20 years ago. </p>
