<p>Mayor de Blasio today announced plans to boost New York City&apos;s cash-strapped network of public hospitals with nearly $2 billion in subsidies out of his just-revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/26/de_blasio_announces_822_billion_exe.php">$82.2 billion 2017 budget</a>. As Public Advocate, de Blasio described the city&apos;s public hospital system as &quot;an outmoded style of care, which relies on... excessive reliance on emergency rooms, and inadequate primary and preventative care... failing patients and providers alike.&quot; </p>

<p>The new funding for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/http://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/hhc/html/about/About-MissionVisionValues.shtml">NYC Health + Hospitals</a>&#x2014;$700 million more than the City granted last year&#x2014;is intended to help close the network&apos;s yawning deficit. H+H describes itself as a &quot;public safety-net healthcare system,&quot; serving patients regardless of their income or immigration status. According to the City, 70% of H+H patients are either uninsured or on Medicaid, compared to less than 40% at other city hospitals.</p>

<p>A City report [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/H+H_Report.pdf">PDF</a>] released in conjunction with today&apos;s announcement projects that H+H&apos;s deficit could reach $600 million within the next year and&#x2014;without intervention&#x2014;$1.8 billion by 2020. &quot;Health + Hospitals is on the edge of a financial cliff,&quot; the report states. </p>

<p>While NYC&apos;s busiest public hospitals, Queens Hospital Center and Kings County Hospital Center, are typically full to near-capacity, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/nyregion/de-blasio-to-propose-2-billion-for-new-york-citys-hospital-system.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur">NY Times reports</a> that North Central Bronx Hospital often has half of its beds full. According to the report, Metropolitan, Woodhull and Elmhurst all saw &quot;double digit declines&quot; in patients between 2012 and 2014. </p>

<p>Insisting that the new funding is not part of a &quot;band-aid fix,&quot; de Blasio also released a series of recommendations for H+H this week, including selling vacant H+H land and underutilized hospital facilities to developers for the construction of affordable and supportive housing. (The Mayor has employed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/nycha_deblasio_protest.php">similar tactic</a> on NYCHA properties, to mixed reviews.) Not only would these sales bring revenue to H+H, the report argues, but they could provide mental health patients with stable accommodations. </p>

<p>Politico NY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/04/8597619/new-report-city-hospitals-filled-familiar-ideas?news-image">points out</a> that such extreme repurposing of hospital properties would require approval from the State&apos;s public health council, which the report doesn&apos;t breach. </p>

<p>Indeed, several of the recommendations are not within the City&apos;s powers to enact, and will require State lobbying. For example, H+H currently relies heavily on federal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/financing-and-reimbursement/medicaid-disproportionate-share-hospital-dsh-payments.html">Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital</a> (DSH) payments, which are allocated at the State&apos;s discretion to hospitals that serve large uninsured populations. DSH funding is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913214048/http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/medicaid-dsh-cuts-mean-crisis-some-hospitals">set to decrease nation-wide</a> starting in 2018. Today&apos;s report promises to &quot;seek legislative action&quot; to increase H+H&apos;s share of the dwindling federal funds. </p>

<p>More broadly, the report calls on the H+H to establish more walk-in centers and clinics spread out in low income neighborhoods, so that uninsured patients don&apos;t have to rely on hospital visits for minor treatments. Over the next four years $100 million in new City funding will be directed to community clinics, specifically. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio stated on Tuesday that the shift of staffing and resources from hospitals to neighborhood clinics won&apos;t result in any staff layoffs. &quot;Over the past 13 years, 18 private hospitals have closed throughout New York City. This plan will not close any more hospitals or layoff any workers,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>But the 55-page report amends this claim, stating that, &quot;Even with re-training and shifting existing hospital staff to community-based health centers and clinics, there is likely to be a net loss of hospital-based jobs.&quot; According to the City, impacted workers could be shifted to other government jobs. </p>
