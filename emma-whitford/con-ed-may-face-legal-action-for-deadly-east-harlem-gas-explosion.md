<p>State investigators have concluded a 20-month probe into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011135048/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/12/explosion_harlem.php#photo-13">East Harlem gas explosion</a> of March 2014&#x2014;which killed eight people and left more than 20 injured&#x2014;and Con Edison may now face fines or legal action for its alleged involvement in the blast. </p>

<p>The deadly explosion took place shortly after 9:30 a.m. last March 12th, at 1646 and 1644 Park Avenue on the corner of East 116th Street. Neighbors had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011135048/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/nyregion/consolidated-edison-is-largely-liable-in-deadly-east-harlem-explosion-regulators-find.html?ref=nyregion">reportedly failed</a> to report a strong gas odor for days prior.</p>

<p>The Public Service Commission <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011135048/http://www3.dps.ny.gov/pscweb/WebFileRoom.nsf/ArticlesByCategory/4505F7C3966E44A085257F020062E854/$File/pr15083.pdf?OpenElement">announced its findings</a> in a meeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011135048/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/11/8583552/psc-releases-harlem-gas-explosion-probe-could-fine-con-edison?news-image">on Thursday afternoon</a>. According to the PSC, the explosion was caused by soil erosion under the street that put pressure on a gas line that had been poorly and improperly fused. The pressure caused a leak that went on for days leading up to the explosion. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011135048/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/10/ntsb_con_eds_nycs_shoddy_infrastruc.php#photo-1">separate investigation</a> conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board faulted Con Edison over the summer, placing blame on city government as well. According to the NTSB, the poorly-welded joint wasn&apos;t helped by a breached sewer main on the block&#x2014;one that the city had allegedly ignored for years. Con Edison <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011135048/http://nypost.com/2015/06/08/con-ed-blaming-nyc-for-2014-harlem-gas-explosion/">filed suit against the city in June</a>, claiming that the NYC Department of Transportation knew about &quot;depressions and cave-ins in the roadway&quot; at Park Avenue between East 116th and East 177th streets. </p>

<p>The PSC report also accuses Con Ed of not adequately training or certifying its workers in pipe-fusing, and failing to install the correct valves to prevent gas leaks. According to the PSC, the contractor who fused the fated joint had let his certification expire the month previous. </p>

<p>&quot;We maintain that a cracked fitting, damaged by undermined street infrastructure from a pre-existing sewer breach, was the source of the leak that led to the East Harlem gas explosion,&quot; said Con Ed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011135048/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/11/8583552/psc-releases-harlem-gas-explosion-probe-could-fine-con-edison?news-image">in a statement to Capital</a>. The company has a month to respond to the findings in more detail. </p>

<p>The city has challenged Con Ed&apos;s account. In June, the Mayor&apos;s office stated, &quot;The rupture in the City&#x2019;s water main occurred as a result of the explosion, not due to the damaged sewer.... Put simply, the full investigation reveals that a properly fused fusion joint would not have failed.&quot; </p>

<p>Any fines or civil penalties as a result of the PSC report are pending. </p>
