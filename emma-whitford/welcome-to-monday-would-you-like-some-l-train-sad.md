title: Welcome To Monday! Would You Like Some L Train? Sad!
---

	
										<p>It may not feel like anything remotely related to a distant cousin of Spring this fine April Monday, but at least some L train tracks on 3rd Avenue were basking in the cozy daffodil-yellow hell flames of a track fire this morning, long enough to send the line into a rush hour tailspin. </p>

<p>Yes, Bedford Avenue magically transformed into the end of the line for Manhattan-bound L trains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811051343/https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/716966529334710273">at 8:33 this morning</a>, like a sick preview of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811051343/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/l_train_tunnel_closure_years.php">things to come</a>. </p>

<p>The MTA says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811051343/https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/716971841731043328">service resumed at 8:55</a> with residual delays, but tell that to your self esteem, self worth, and general sense of self. </p>
