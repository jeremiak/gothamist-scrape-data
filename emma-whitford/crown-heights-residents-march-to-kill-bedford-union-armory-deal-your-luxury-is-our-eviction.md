					<p>Fort Greene neighbors gathered on their brownstone stoops late Wednesday afternoon, watching hundreds of protesters march down the middle of Adelphi Street toward City Council Member Laurie Cumbo&apos;s office carrying signs that read &quot;Kill the Deal&quot; and &quot;Your Luxury is Our Displacement.&quot; Some of the neighbors accepted flyers demanding that Cumbo withdraw her support from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/31/crown_heights_armory_project.php">a controversial plan</a> to redevelop a city-owned armory in her district.</p>

<p>Patrick Suer, 45, stopped on the sidewalk with his young daughter in tow. &quot;This is the first time I&apos;ve seen an actual protest in Fort Greene,&quot; he said.  </p>

<p>Crown Heights residents, affordable housing advocates, and local labor unions have argued for months that developer BFC Partners&apos; vision for the Bedford-Union Armory, located a few blocks from the coffee shops and boutiques of Franklin Avenue, will accelerate displacement in their neighborhood. The plan calls for a mix of market-rate and affordable apartments and luxury condominiums, as well as offices, community space, and a rec center featuring basketball courts, a swimming pool and an indoor turf field. </p>

<p>The apartments designated as &quot;affordable&quot; will be 50 percent below market rate, though just 67 units, out of a total 330, have been set aside for renters who make less than 50 percent of the Area Median Income, or $38,835 for a family of three. Meanwhile, neighbors worry that the proposed 99 apartments at 110 percent of the AMI&#x2014;in addition to the more than 50 townhouse-style condos&#x2014;will put more pressure on local rent-stabilized tenants who are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/15/crown_heights_landlord_battle.php">facing harassment</a> from landlords.</p>

<p>&quot;We know why homelessness is increasing,&quot; said Corey Bates, an organizer with the advocacy group VOCAL-NY. &quot;It&apos;s simple: pretty developers are coming into our communities, building luxury housing, and making it too expensive for people to live in the communities that they grew up in.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170320/prospect-heights/cumbo-city-council-race-ede-fox-jabari-brisport">Two challengers</a> in this year&apos;s City Council election have demanded that BFC back out of the project entirely, making way for a 100 percent affordable housing project, potentially using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/09/nyc_affordable_housing_vacancy.php">community land trust model</a>. But Cumbo has said that she prefers to see the current proposal through, and negotiate improvements. In the last year, a controversial developer with ties to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/les_luxury_condos_everywhere.php">Rivington House scandal</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/bedford_armory_slate_deal.php">severed ties</a> with BFC. BFC also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/01/crown_heights_armory_fight.php">committed</a> to launching an affordable housing fund for the neighborhood. </p>

<p>&quot;Let&apos;s just continue to negotiate, see what the final outcome is, and if it&apos;s satisfactory,&quot; Cumbo told Gothamist in a phone interview in January. &quot;If it&apos;s going to have a negative impact, then we vote it down and move forward.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="041317_Rat.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/041317_Rat.jpeg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> (Scott Lynch / Gothamist) </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Gathering to march on the northeast corner of Fort Greene Park on Wednesday, dozens of labor union members surrounded Sam Spokony, a lone representative for BFC, shouting &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Service workers union 32BJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170411/crown-heights/32bj-union-jobs-bedford-union-armory-development">recently announced</a> that the armory will employ union workers, and establish a job training program. However, BFC has yet to commit to union construction labor. </p>

<p>Spokony, apparently unfazed, retreated across the street to facilitate interviews with Geoffrey Davis, a lifelong Crown Heights resident and anti-violence advocate. Davis is planning to rent below-market rate office space in the complex. </p>

<p>&quot;In Crown Heights we have this wonderful program called Jouvet, and violence happens every year,&quot; Davis said. &quot;We have the opportunity to address that in one building.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This approach of screaming and fussing and &apos;kill the deal&apos; is absurd because we can&apos;t have this armory just sitting there empty for another 30 years,&quot; he added. &quot;If that&apos;s the case, our prisons will grow with our young people, and our cemeteries will fill with our young people.&quot; </p>

<p>According to a BFC spokesman, the market-rate housing in the development will cross-subsidize the rec center, which will offer free or reduced memberships to Crown Heights residents (he did not provide specifics on the cost breakdown). </p>

<p>&quot;Each job we undertake requires us to strike the right balance to ensure success for the project and achieve community goals that serve local families,&quot; he stated. </p>

<p>Donna Mossman, an organizer with the Crown Heights Tenants Union, challenged the argument that Crown Heights residents can only have a rec center with condos attached, particularly on land that is city-owned. &quot;You&apos;re holding us hostage,&quot; she said. &quot;What you are saying to us is, if you want the rec center, let us build one million dollar condos. And we&apos;re going to give you a rec center that you&apos;re going to have to pay to attend. Tell me how that&apos;s a good deal.&quot; </p>

<p>Mossman added that the city&apos;s continued support of the project is particularly frustrating in light of the drive to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/09/photos_crown_heights_residents_marc.php#photo-1">open new homeless shelters</a> in Crown Heights. &quot;They are building transitional homeless shelters to transition people to where?&quot; she asked. &quot;Nobody can live in Crown Heights. The tenants who are homeless are homeless because they cannot afford to pay $2,500 a month in rent.&quot;</p>

<p>Protesters chanted &quot;Kill the deal!&quot; outside Cumbo&apos;s Hansen Place office around 6 p.m., surrounding an advertisement truck broadcasting her image (the truck has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420090502/https://twitter.com/rachelholliday/status/851484925014536193">spotted around the district this week</a>). After about 20 minutes, Cumbo&apos;s Chief of Staff invited five protesters upstairs. The group refused, instead providing business cards to set up a larger meeting at a future date. </p>

<p>&quot;It was unfortunate to learn that our invitation to meet tonight was denied, as I hoped that we could have heard from the coalition leaders to keep communications open and flowing,&quot; Cumbo said in a statement to Gothamist.</p>
