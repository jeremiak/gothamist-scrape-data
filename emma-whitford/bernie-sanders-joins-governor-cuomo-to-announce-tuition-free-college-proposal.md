<p>Standing alongside Senator Bernie Sanders at a community college in Queens on Tuesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-presents-1st-proposal-2017-state-state-making-college-tuition-free-new-york-s">a proposal to eliminate tuition</a> for hundreds of thousands of public four-year and community college students across the state. The roughly-sketched plan, which must be approved by the state legislature, would provide full tuition relief for individuals or families who make $125,000 per year or less. Free tuition would apply to all City University of New York and State University of New York schools&#x2014;84 in total. </p>

<p>&quot;If you want to offer everyone a fair shot, you have to get up to date and say, &apos;What high school was 75 years ago, college is today,&apos;&quot; Governor Cuomo told a cheering crowd of union members and local legislators. &quot;The way society said, &apos;We&apos;re going to pay for high school because you need high school,&apos; this society should say, &apos;We&apos;re going to pay for college because you need college.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Cuomo, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/gov-cuomo-seek-reelection-run-president-article-1.2874698">appears to be considering</a> a 2020 presidential run, was also careful to contextualize the announcement. &quot;It should be a wake-up call to this nation,&quot; he said. A Hillary Clinton supporter during last year&apos;s presidential campaign, he heaped praise on Senator Sanders, calling the Clinton challenger &quot;ahead of his time&quot; and a candidate who &quot;really woke the nation&quot; with his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/https://berniesanders.com/issues/its-time-to-make-college-tuition-free-and-debt-free/">tuition-free college proposal</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;If New York does it this year,&quot; Sanders said during his own remarks, &quot;mark my words, state after state will follow.&quot; </p>

<p>A CUNY education was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/6444-could-cuny-be-tuition-free-again">free for qualifying students</a> from its founding in 1847 until 1976. Today, according to the Governor&apos;s Office, average annual tuition for a bachelors degree through CUNY or SUNY ranges from $6,330 to $6,470. For an associates degree, the range is $4,350 to $4,800. In 2015, the average student loan debt in New York State was $29,320. </p>

<p>The proposed scholarship would be accessible to about 940,000 families, according to the Governor. Students would have to be enrolled in a SUNY or CUNY school full-time to qualify&#x2014;a qualification Cuomo says will motivate students to complete their studies on time. </p>

<p>Named the Excelsior Scholarship, the program would cover the remaining cost of tuition after state and federal scholarships have been exhausted&#x2014;a so-called &quot;last dollar&quot; funding structure. Already, New York State offers close to $1 billion in grants to college students through its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/apply-for-financial-aid/nys-tap.html">Tuition Assistance Program</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;&apos;Last dollar&apos; means that after the student as exploited all of the other possible sources of financial aid, <em>then</em> if there is any tuition remaining, this scholarship will cover that,&quot; said Professor Thomas Bailey, director of the Community College Research Center at Columbia University&apos;s Teachers College. </p>

<p>Bailey warned that the &quot;last dollar&quot; approach can end up providing less aid to low-income students than a &quot;first dollar&quot; approach, which would cover the entirety of the tuition up-front. &quot;First dollar&quot; programs cover tuition in addition to state and federal aid, meaning low-income students who also qualify for, say, the federal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/pell.htm">Pell grant</a>, get more aid overall. The Pell grant currently applies to students whose families make less than $25,000 per year. Any funds that don&apos;t go towards tuition can be spent on food, lodging and textbooks. </p>

<p>&quot;If it were &apos;first dollar,&apos; then it would help the people who really need it the most,&quot; he said. &quot;And it would give them additional money for living expenses, which are crucial.&quot; President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/https://collegepromise.org/">launched</a> a first-dollar tuition-free campaign in 2015, called America&apos;s College Promise. However, Obama&apos;s proposal would be for community colleges only. Cuomo&apos;s is more comprehensive in that it would apply to four year public colleges, as well. </p>

<p>Cuomo is hoping to establish the Excelsior Scholarship over the course of the next three years. According to his office, full scholarships would be accessible to families making up to $100,000 annually in fall 2017, $110,000 annually in 2018, and $125,000 annually in fall 2019. </p>

<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170711003420js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>There are currently 37 states with tuition-free college programs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/12/tuition-free-two-year-public-college-on-the-horizon-in-new-york-108383">Politico reports</a>. Some are established at specific colleges, or apply to cities. Others are state-wide, but are limited to community and technical colleges. Many of these programs are &quot;last dollar,&quot; like Cuomo&apos;s proposed program. </p>

<p>Bailey also cautioned that the success of any tuition-free program will hinge on accompanying investments in CUNY and SUNY schools: the sort of funding that supports smaller class sizes and more course offerings, as well as higher salaries for professors. A promising model is CUNY&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/asap/">Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP)</a> program, which waives tuition for qualifying low-income students, in addition to providing MetroCards, money for textbooks, and student counseling. </p>

<p>Until the Governor&apos;s Office clarifies where the funding will come from, there&apos;s concern about how a tuition-free model might negatively impact public education overall. </p>

<p>&quot;Research has suggested that bigger classes, more online courses, and more adjunct professors tend to make student outcomes worse,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;That&apos;s the kind of things that colleges have done to cut costs. So, yes, you are reducing the cost. But there&apos;s a cost to reducing that cost.&quot; </p>

<p>Fran Clark, a spokesman for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/https://www.facebook.com/PSC.CUNY/">Professional Staff Congress of CUNY</a>, the union representing CUNY faculty and staff, said that PSC is eager to learn about the funding plan. Last year, Cuomo said that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/15/yr_mom_better_pack_a_snickers_tmw_deblahzero.php">expected</a> New York City to take over $485 million of CUNY&apos;s funding costs. He eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/cuomo_cuny_funding.php">backpedaled</a>, but union members say he&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/15/cuny_feel_the_bern.php">lowballing</a> the public university network for years. In 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/nyregion/bernie-sanders-urges-cuomo-to-raise-pay-for-cuny-professors.html">according to the NY Times</a>, CUNY faced a $51 million budget shortfall. </p>

<p>&quot;The PSC welcomes any investment in free tuition,&quot; Clark said. &quot;We&apos;ve supported that for years. But it needs to come with increased investment from the state in quality in CUNY as well.&quot; </p>

<p>Blaire Horner, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, is campaigning for restored funding for CUNY and SUNY. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711003420/http://www.nypirg.org/higher_ed/funding.html">According to his group</a>, higher education funding across the state has been reduced by about $1 billion over the last 15 years. </p>

<p>&quot;The devil will be in the details, but we think it&apos;s a great step forward,&quot; Horner told Gothamist. &quot;The only thing we&apos;re going to be mindful of, is when [Governor Cuomo] puts his budget out, does he couple it with raising tuition at the four-year schools to cover this?&quot;</p>

<p>Both CUNY and SUNY have endorsed the proposal. &quot;SUNY strongly supports the Excelsior Scholarship Program and we will be making it a top priority in the upcoming budget session,&quot; said Chairman Carl McCall and Chancellor Nancy Zimpher in a statement. </p>

<p>&quot;We applaud the Governor&#x2019;s announcement today and look forward to seeing the full details of the plan,&quot; said Mayoral Spokeswoman Freddi Goldstien. </p>
