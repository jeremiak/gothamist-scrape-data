<p>A 25-year-old man says that he was drugged and sexually assaulted after stepping out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103627/https://www.boxersnyc.com/">Boxers Sports Bar</a>, a gay sports bar in Hell&apos;s Kitchen, early Sunday morning. </p>

<p>The victim, whose name has not been released, left Boxers on the corner of 9th Avenue and West 50th Street around 2:30 a.m. on Sunday and turned towards Times Square, according to a complaint filed with the NYPD. A spokesman for the department said Wednesday that the suspect allegedly approached the victim from behind at 50th Street, and said &quot;Hey, come here.&quot; The complaint indicates that he then knocked the victim unconscious with poppers, slang for amyl nitrite. The drug, often sold in small vials, is an inhalant. Overdoses are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103627/https://tripsit.me/tag/poppers/">uncommon</a>. </p>

<p>The victim regained partial consciousness inside a parked car in an unknown location and realized that a man was sexually assaulting him, according to the police. He woke up fully some time later, alone at a bus stop on 110th Street (the NYPD could not confirm an intersection). </p>

<p>The victim then checked himself in to Wyckoff Medical Center in Bushwick. There are no injuries listed on the incident report. <br>
 <br>
Poppers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103627/https://www.verywell.com/what-are-poppers-22094">developed in the 1960s</a> as a heart medicine, but they&apos;ve been popular as a quick-hit high on the rave scene since the 1970s. They&apos;re also sold over the counter at many gay novelty shops, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103627/http://www.advocate.com/health/2016/3/02/poppers-indelible-piece-gay-culture-or-part-past">according to</a> the gay news magazine The Advocate.</p>

<p>As of this morning, the NYPD has no description of the suspect. The spokesman said that the Special Victims Unit is investigating, and next steps include canvasing the neighborhood for surveillance footage. </p>
