<p>A 35-year-old Jewish man wearing traditional Hasidic clothing was assaulted by two men on a Crown Heights sidewalk on Thursday evening, and the incident is now being investigated by the NYPD&apos;s Hate Crime Task Force.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060231/http://jpupdates.com/2016/04/14/chasidic-man-assaulted-in-crown-heights-one-suspect-arrested/">Video footage</a> acquired by JP Updates shows one man throwing a punch at the victim, who is operating a forklift on the sidewalk, and then fleeing the scene. The victim then jumps from his seat and pulls the assailant&apos;s companion to the ground, reportedly holding him down until 71st Precinct officers arrived. </p>

<p>The incident took place around 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, at 617 Brooklyn Avenue near Fenimore Street in Crown Heights, according to the NYPD. Two men approached the 35-year-old forklift driver and allegedly asked him for the time. When the driver took out his phone to check the time, one of the men punched him in the face and fled west on Fenimore Street. </p>

<p>The man who allegedly threw the punch is still at large. Tarik Michel, 17, has been arrested and charged with assault. </p>
