<p>The NYPD has released surveillance footage of a suspect who they believe was involved in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310030059/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/18/bedstuy_subway_shooting.php">rush-hour shooting</a> at the Utica Avenue A/C subway station entrance in Bed-Stuy on Tuesday evening. Two men, ages 27 and 45, were shot shortly after 5:00 p.m. as evening commuters streamed out of the station onto the corner of Fulton Street and Utica Avenue. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the suspect shot the 27-year-old victim in the right arm, torso, and inner right thigh. The 45-year-old victim was shot in the back. Both men were taken to Kings County Hospital in stable condition, and the motivation for the shooting is still under investigation. </p>

<p>The suspect appears in the bodega surveillance footage below, wearing a light-grey sweatshirt and sweatpants. The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310030059/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/nyregion/two-are-shot-at-a-brooklyn-subway-station.html?ref=nyregion">referenced this footage</a> in its initial reportage of the shooting: </p>

<blockquote>A police official on the scene said the shooting occurred after a dispute between the 27-year-old and another person outside a bodega on the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard and Fulton Street.

<p>Detectives talked to the workers at the bodega and reviewed security footage on the store&#x2019;s monitor that showed a small figure in a gray hood walking up to the counter. A worker at the bodega told reporters that the person believed to have opened fire came into the store before the shooting and tried to break a $20 bill. </p></blockquote><p></p>
