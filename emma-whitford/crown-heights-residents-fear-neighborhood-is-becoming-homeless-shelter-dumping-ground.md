<p>Desmond Atkins, a lifelong resident of Crown Heights, accused the Department of Homeless Services on Wednesday of continuing a legacy of racial discrimination by opening a men&apos;s shelter in his neighborhood&#x2014;a part of Brooklyn that is majority black and, he believes, already saturated with similar facilities. </p>

<p>&quot;People who look like me, or who speak other languages, typically are placed in neighborhoods and areas that are dumped upon,&quot; said Atkins, who is black. &quot;This community was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810205202/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/19/498536077/interactive-redlining-map-zooms-in-on-americas-history-of-discrimination">redlined</a> when I was a child in the &apos;60s and the &apos;50s... This community should not be a dumping ground.&quot;</p>

<p>Wednesday night marked the second meeting in as many weeks about Bergen House: a new shelter for roughly 100 senior men ages 62 and older slated to open later this month at 1173 Bergen Street. Located on a residential brownstone block, it&apos;s the first of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810205202/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/01/de_blasio_homeless_plan.php">90 new shelters</a> that Mayor de Blasio hopes will reverse New York City&apos;s decades-long trend of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810205202/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/30/homeless_in_nyc_hits_new_record_hig.php">steadily increasing homelessness</a>. At the first meeting, a standing-room-only crowd drowned out city officials with chants of, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810205202/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/05/were_going_to_shut_it_down_crown_he.php">Shut it down!</a>&quot; </p>

<p>Demanding a fair distribution of shelters across the city, Crown Heights residents have tapped into an early criticism of City Hall&apos;s new strategy. In an effort to keep homeless families close to their communities&#x2014;schools, churches, friends&#x2014;new shelters will be distributed according to the number of people entering the shelter system in each neighborhood. A DHS spokesman called the approach &quot;better for our homeless neighbors&quot; who can &quot;stabilize their lives faster.&quot; </p>

<p>But critics have countered that many of these neighborhoods are already saturated. They also tend to be less wealthy&#x2014;and less white&#x2014;than the city&apos;s shelter-free pockets. </p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810205202/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/rich-white-neighborhoods-spared-de-blasio-homeless-plan-article-1.2995360">report this week from the Daily News</a>, the five community districts with the most shelter beds&#x2014;Jamaica and Hollis in Queens; Concourse and Highbridge in the Bronx; Brownsville; East New York; East Harlem&#x2014;are majority black or Hispanic. For comparison, six of the seven community districts with zero shelters&#x2014;Tottenville and South Beach in Staten Island, Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, and Forest Hills in Queens&#x2014;are majority white. </p>

<p>Crown Heights&apos; community district eight already has 15 shelters, while district one, which covers lower Manhattan south of Canal Street, has two. District eight is 67.5 percent black, with a 26 percent poverty rate, according to the Daily News. District one is 79.9 percent white, with an eight percent poverty rate. </p>

<p>Many residents insisted on Wednesday that they were opposed to this disparity, not to helping homeless people on principal. &quot;You come into poor communities, you buy up cheap buildings, and you house them in warehouses,&quot; accused Jennifer Catto, a Crown Heights resident of seven years and member of the Dean Street Block Association.</p>

<p>According to DHS, the city has plans to close five shelter sites in the community, with 80 people across them, before year&apos;s end. Another two sites will close over the course of de Blasio&apos;s five year plan, serving 220 people. Taking into account a second new shelter planned for the district, at 174 Prospect Place, the city estimates a net loss of 100 shelter beds over five years. </p>

<p>The city has also pledged to provide more notice ahead of any future shelter openings (Bergen House was confirmed in mid-February). </p>

<p>&quot;I have trouble believing that that will be the case when time and time again I was the last one to hear,&quot; Council Member Robert Cornegy countered. </p>

<p>&quot;Homelessness is a complex issue that has built up over decades,&quot; Isaac McGinn, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeless Services, told Gothamist earlier this month. &quot;To meet immediate capacity needs, in the short term, shelters may be placed in communities that already have a significant number of shelters.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="031716_Shelter3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810205202im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/031716_Shelter3.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Daniel Pietz, Chief Special Services Officer for NYC&apos;s Human Resources Administration (Scott Heins / Gothamist). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;In the past 20 years we&apos;ve lost Interfaith Hospital and St. Mary&apos;s Hospital,&quot; said Gregg Todd, who&apos;s lived in Crown Heights since 1987. &quot;Meanwhile, Park Slope Methodist is undergoing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810205202/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160505/REAL_ESTATE/160509919/new-york-methodists-445-million-expansion-underway-despite-neighbors-concerns">huge expansion</a> right now. Why are we putting homeless men where there are no facilities, when you have a brand new facility right across the park?&quot; </p>

<p>Park Slope&apos;s community district six has 267 shelter beds, according to the city, compared to district eight&apos;s 679. </p>

<p>Several neighbors also said they were concerned about their safety, and overall quality of life. Gail Muhammad, 66, a Dean Street resident of 18 years, said she was frustrated with the takeout food containers she&apos;d seen strewn outside the Bedford Armory men&apos;s shelter, two blocks from the Bergen location.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you guarantee us that none of these men ever sexually abused somebody?&quot; added Kimberly Riddick, 63, a Bergen Street resident of 31 years. &quot;There&apos;s too many kids [in the neighborhood].&quot; </p>

<p>Gordon Jackson, head of community affairs for shelter operator CORE Services Group, ran down a list of security measures, including cameras and regular neighborhood patrols. &quot;If you see something happening, take a picture and send it to the number posted outside the shelter,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ll investigate it.&quot; </p>

<p>A small number of attendees expressed support for the shelter on Wednesday, referring to Mayor de Blasio&apos;s stated goal of keeping families in their communities (DHS clarified Wednesday that Bergen House will give preference to men from Brooklyn, not Crown Heights specifically). </p>

<p>Dienane Fleurival, 29, works three days a week at Hebron Seventh Day Adventist Church across the street from the new shelter. A Flatbush resident, she said that gentrification is to blame for New York City&apos;s homelessness crisis, and accused the anti-shelter crowd of being complicit in this cycle. </p>

<p>&quot;Why are people who are from the community, who cannot afford rent, being punished?&quot; said Fleurival, who is black, prompting boos. &quot;This is their community, too. Just because you guys pay $2,000 a month [in rent], why should we take it out on them?&quot; </p>

<p>Catto, who is white, insisted that opposition to the shelter &quot;cuts across race and socioeconomic status.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In my block association, four of the five officers grew up on the block,&quot; she said. &quot;In one case, their grandparents grew up on the block. The common denominator here is that we want what&apos;s best for the community.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s a misconception that if you fight against a shelter you are against helping homeless people,&quot; Council Member Cornegy echoed. &quot;You cannot defend saturation.&quot; </p>

<p>He closed the night with an allusion to gentrification, suggesting that long-time property owners deserve to reap its benefits. &quot;They were here when no one wanted to be here,&quot; he said, to a standing ovation. &quot;And now it&apos;s sexy to be here, and you&apos;re not respecting their property values.&quot; </p>
