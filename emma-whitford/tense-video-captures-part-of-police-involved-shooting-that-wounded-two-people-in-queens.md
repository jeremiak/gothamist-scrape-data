title: Tense Video Captures Part Of Police-Involved Shooting That Wounded Two People In Queens
---

	
										<p>Two people have been hospitalized in serious condition following a police-involved shooting in the Maspeth neighborhood of Queens on Monday afternoon, according to the FDNY. </p>

<p>An NYPD official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103241/https://twitter.com/JPeterDonald/status/760205282899292160">has tweeted</a> that there are no fatalities. A video from the scene, shared by a tipster, captures the sound of one gun shot followed by a scream. </p>

<p>Before the shot rings out, the person taking the video passes over police officers staking out a residential building on 66th Street near Hull Avenue. &quot;Oh he got his gun out!&quot; the person says of one cop. And then, &quot;Oh they all go their guns out, man.&quot; </p>

<p>A woman approaches the open door of the building, calls in &quot;Lisa?&quot;, and enters. Soon after she exits, holding what appears to be a baby, the shot rings out. </p>

<p>Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103241/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Shot-in-the-Head-Queens-NYPD-388858832.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">told NBC</a> that one civilian was shot in the midst of a &quot;struggle with police over a gun&quot; after cops responded to a call about an alleged robbery. According to the source, a woman called in a report about an intruder in her home. Police encountered the alleged robber, and a chase ensued. </p>

<p>First responders discovered the victims near the intersection of 66th Street and Hull Avenue at 1:55 p.m., and transported both to Elmhurst Hospital in serious condition.

It wasn&apos;t immediately clear if the injury was from a gunshot. The second, a man, was reportedly shot in the groin. </p>
