<p>TSA workers on an otherwise routine Christmas Eve shift at Newark Airport were apparently surprised to come across a cane with a twist-off handle &quot;artfully&quot; concealing a &quot;deadly-looking,&quot; sharpened-steel ice pick early Thursday morning. </p>

<p>As TSA spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein put it, &quot;Tis the season for candy canes filled with sugar, not wooden canes filled with steel ice picks.&quot; Please make a note of this. </p>

<p>According to the TSA, a man from Maplewood, New Jersey attempted to pass through his security screening at Newark early Thursday morning with the cane in question. Passengers who use canes are still required to send them along the X-ray machine&apos;s conveyor belt, in this case prompting a TSA worker attending the machine to report &quot;something unusual in the area of the cane&apos;s handle.&quot; The steel pick was quickly revealed with a &quot;twist and a pull.&quot; </p>

<p>Port Authority Police responded to the checkpoint and arrested the cane-reliant traveler, whose name has not been released. </p>

<p>The Port Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> TSA has issued a formal correction confirming that the cane owner was not arrested. The cane was simply confiscated. </p>
