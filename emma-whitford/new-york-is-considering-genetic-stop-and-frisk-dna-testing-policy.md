<p>A State panel of scientists is considering a controversial DNA testing policy that would allow police to investigate the relatives of New Yorkers whose DNA closely matches DNA recovered from a crime scene. </p>

<p>The &apos;familial searching&apos; method got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161208/howard-beach/richard-brown-karina-vetrano-james-oneill">strong endorsement</a> from the Queens District Attorney last summer, when police failed to find an exact match for DNA recovered from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/06/karina_vetranos_murder_arrest.php#photo-1">Karina Vetrano</a>, a Queens woman who was murdered while out on a jog in Howard Beach. &quot;This technology has proven effective at generating important DNA investigative leads in cold cases,&quot; said Queens DA Richard Brown. &quot;We have an obligation to use every means at our disposal to identify the murderer.&quot; </p>

<p>But legal services organizations have countered that a board of scientists is not qualified to approve a method with serious implications for how New York polices low-income communities of color. </p>

<p>According to the familial searching guidelines being considered, police would be able to pull close DNA matches in certain criminal investigations, generating a list of people with prior convictions, including low-level <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/http://gothamist.com/tags/brokenwindows">broken windows</a> convictions like trespassing. Police would then have leeway to investigate close relatives of those near matches (son, father, etc.), in hopes of turning up the exact match&#x2014;a viable suspect in the case.</p>

<p>In other words, the New York Civil Liberties Union <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/https://www.nyclu.org/en/publications/comments-regarding-familial-dna-searching">has testified</a>, &quot;criminal suspicion will attach to innocent persons merely because of their biological relation to a person whose DNA is in the state&apos;s databank.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You are creating a &apos;suspect class&apos; of citizens,&quot; David Loftist, attorney in charge of post conviction and forensic litigation at the Legal Aid Society, told Gothamist. &quot;If you have a family member that has been convicted of fare beating, his DNA is in the database. Now all of his family members would be subject to searching in perpetuity.&quot;</p>

<p>Loftist added that the majority of individuals arrested for broken windows offenses are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/broken_windows_still_racist.php">low income men of color</a>. Also, the state DNA databank is, like the State prison population, disproportionately black and Latino. &quot;This creates a dragnet for the entire community now,&quot; he said. &quot;Now all of their relatives are possible suspects. It&apos;s a genetic stop and frisk.&quot; </p>

<p>Robert Perry, legislative director of the NYCLU, also cautioned that police could have &quot;enormous discretion&quot; in conducting these follow-up investigations. &quot;What exactly do they mean?&quot; he said. &quot;Can a person be taken in for an interrogation merely because they are related to someone with a close match?&quot; </p>

Proponents of the method, including the NYPD, have cited a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/https://www.promega.com/resources/profiles-in-dna/familial-searching-extending-the-investigative-lead-potential-of-dna-typing/">1996 Bureau of Justice Statistics report</a> that close to half of inmates in the United States have a close relative who has been incarcerated (an argument the Legal Aid Society has dismissed as &quot;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/http://www.newsday.com/opinion/commentary/don-t-allow-genetic-stop-and-frisk-1.13302422">twist of logic</a>&quot;). Eleven states currently use familial searching, including California, where investigators have<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-familial-dna-20161023-snap-story.html"> reportedly used the method</a> to ID two murderers and five people charged with sexual assault. <p></p>

<p>Vetrano&apos;s parents are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170203/howard-beach/familial-dna-testing-karina-vetrano-murder-howard-beach">proponents of the policy</a>, though a suspect has since been arrested in their daughter&apos;s case. Philip Vetrano, the victim&apos;s father, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/state-forensic-panel-delays-vote-on-familial-dna-1.13446340">told reporters Wednesday</a> that he is &quot;hopeful and optimistic that by the anniversary of Karina&apos;s death that we will have familial searching.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The NYPD supports familial DNA searching which will be beneficial in solving homicides as well as rape, robberies and burglaries,&quot; a spokesperson for the department told Gothamist via email. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420074438/http://www.queensda.org/newpressreleases/2017/FEB%202017/dna%20testimony_(shortened)_02_10_2017_sen.pdf">According to District Attorney Brown</a>, NYC could &quot;safeguard&quot; against unfair searches by requiring police and DAs to complete detailed applications for each familial searching instance. </p>

<p>Brown has also argued that many police investigations don&apos;t lead to any civilian interaction. He compared the process to that of running partial license plates in a crash investigation. &quot;Do they rush out and accuse or arrest every car owner with a potential match?&quot; he said. &quot;Of course not.&quot; </p>

<p>Spokespeople for the Brooklyn and Manhattan DA&apos;s offices also confirmed that they support the practice. </p>

<p>&quot;The policy as drafted strikes a balance between enhancing public safety without compromising individual protections,&quot; said New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services spokeswoman Janine Kava. &quot;Key provisions include providing investigative leads for serious crimes, detail limited circumstances that must be met before a familial search occurs and when those search results can be disclosed to law enforcement, and require training for police and prosecutors on the proper use of familial search results.&quot; </p>

<p>New York&apos;s familial searching policy is still pending a vote from the full Forensic Science committee, which met Wednesday. During that meeting, members acknowledged that the threshold for launching a familial search might be too low. Any &quot;crime presenting a significant public safety threat&quot; in which &quot;reasonable investigative efforts&quot; have been exhausted is potentially applicable, according to the draft. </p>

<p>The committee said Wednesday that it will consider holding a public hearing on the proposal, but none has been set. Its next meeting is scheduled for June 16th. </p>

<p>&quot;The hearing was carefully orchestrated to limit open debate and a full, informed deliberation on the implications,&quot; Perry, of the NYCLU, charged. </p>

<p>&quot;I think familial searching has been thrown under the radar because the wrong people are being asked [to approve it],&quot; Loftist said. &quot;If it is disproportionately impacting poor folks, the dimensions of familial searching need to be discussed with them, and their representatives.&quot; </p>
