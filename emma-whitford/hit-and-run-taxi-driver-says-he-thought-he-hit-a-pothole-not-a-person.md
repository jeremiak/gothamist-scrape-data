<p>The hit-and-run taxi driver who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801195043/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/20/hit-and-run_taxi_driver_arrested_fo.php">was arrested</a> for allegedly fatally striking and dragging a woman in Stuyvesant Town early Saturday morning believed that he had struck a pothole rather than a person, according to his attorney. &quot;We are talking about 3:30 in the morning and he thought it was just a pothole,&quot; attorney Marnie Zien <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801195043/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/20/hit-and-run_taxi_driver_arrested_fo.php">said</a> during the driver&apos;s Sunday arraignment. </p>

<p>The victim, 44-year old Kenya Flores of the Bronx, was lying in a bus lane on First Avenue near East 17th Street when she was struck. Cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801195043/http://nypost.com/2016/03/20/cabbie-arrested-in-fatal-manhattan-hit-and-run/">told the Post</a> that Flores had been released from Bellevue Hospital earlier that night, where she had checked herself in citing suicidal thoughts. </p>

<p>The cabbie, 68-year-old John Bangura, struck Flores around 3:35 a.m. on Saturday, accord to the NYPD. He fled the scene, and EMS transported Flores back to Bellevue Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A preliminary investigation suggested that Flores was lying in the road prior to being struck. </p>

<p>Bangura, who lives in Washington Heights, was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a crash resulting in death. His bail was set at $5,000. </p>

<p>&quot;I am positive that if he knew he hit someone, he would have stopped,&#x201D; Bangura&apos;s wife, Rose Bangura, told the Post. &quot;He&#x2019;s not a coward.&quot;</p>
