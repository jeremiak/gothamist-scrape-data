<p>The Parks Department this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170827170516/https://www.nycgovparks.org/art-map">released a map</a> that pin drops all of its 1,000+ monuments and public art installations&#x2014;from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170827170516/https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/msgr-mcgolrick-park/monuments/1052">Greenpoint War Memorial</a> in McGolrick Park (the bronze winged woman with her left hand raised in the air), to the Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese Monument in Coney Island, to a Revolutionary War memorial in Fort Washington Park called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170827170516/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/nyregion/what-is-the-stone-marker-near-the-george-washington-bridge.html?_r=0">American Redout Marker</a> that&apos;s essentially a pile of boulders. (Description from Parks: &quot;Large boulder resting on several medium-sized boulders, supported by about a dozen small boulders.&quot;) </p>

<p>The map, which is searchable by zip code or address, also marks temporary art installations, like this summer&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170827170516/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/01/public_mood_art_lic_mist_machine.php">Meridian (Gold)</a> in Hunter&apos;s Point South Park. Each pin links to a brief description and a list of basic facts, including the artist or architect, materials used, and, for monuments and statues, the dimensions and dedication date. </p>

<p>&quot;This is the first time we&apos;ve ever had a comprehensive, interactive digital map of all our permanent and temporary installations,&quot; said Parks spokesman Sam Biederman this week. &quot;It&apos;s like PokemonGO but REAL.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ll let you decide if bumping into lampposts searching for Dragonite is the same as planning your next park excursion based on proximity to public art. But regardless, the map is easy to explore and a good reminder that there are plenty of public art hot spots outside Central Park&#x2014;like Corona in Queens, Hudson Heights in Manhattan, and St. George in Staten Island. </p>

<p>We&apos;re not holding our breath for the app version, but you can peruse the map <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170827170516/https://www.nycgovparks.org/art-map">here</a>.</p>
