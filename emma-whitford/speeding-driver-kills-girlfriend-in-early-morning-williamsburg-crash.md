<p>A 27-year-old Brooklyn man was arrested and charged with manslaughter, DWAI and speeding, among other charges, after he crashed his Honda Civic into a tractor-trailer early Wednesday morning. His girlfriend, who was in the front passenger seat, was killed in the collision. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="122415_Crash2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053237im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/122415_Crash2.jpg" width="320" height="569"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> Lemache (via Facebook). </i></div> According to the NYPD, Elroy Perez was driving north on Vandervoort Avenue in Williamsburg just before 6:00 a.m. on Wednesday when he crashed into the passenger side of a tractor-trailer that was pulling out of a commercial parking lot near the corner of Withers Street. The tractor driver was not injured, and remained on the scene. Perez&apos;s Honda became wedged under the truck&apos;s bed. <p></p>

<p>Perez suffered only minor injuries, but his passenger and longtime girlfriend, 26-year-old Diana Lemache, suffered fatal head trauma. EMS responders transported her unconscious and unresponsive to Woodhull Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. </p>

He is being held on $50,000 bail following his Wednesday night arraignment. Speed is believed to have been a factor in the crash. According to the tabloid, the couple was driving home from a work party. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a foggy morning. The truck was pulling out onto Vandervoort when that car came tearing down,&quot; a warehouse worker who witnessed the crash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053237/http://nypost.com/2015/12/23/car-lodged-under-trucks-bed-after-crash/">told the Post</a>. </p>

<p>Other charges against Perez include operating a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs&#x2014;reportedly marijuana&#x2014;and criminally negligent homicide. </p>

<p>Perez and Lemache reportedly have a four-year-old daughter named Eliana. </p>

<p>&quot;She was supposed to go out Christmas shopping for her daughter today,&quot; Perez&apos;s mother, Gina, told the News. &quot;We&apos;re not in the mood to celebrate Christmas right now.&quot;</p>
