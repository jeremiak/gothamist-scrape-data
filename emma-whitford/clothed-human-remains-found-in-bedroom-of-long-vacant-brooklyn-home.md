<p>Police are investigating fully-clothed skeletal remains found on the second floor of a two-story East New York apartment building on Monday afternoon, according to the NYPD. City records <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201519/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/human-remains-found-vacant-east-new-york-brooklyn-home-article-1.2548295">show</a> that the property has been vacant since the previous owner died in 2013, and went up for auction last December. Police said the remains were discovered by the building&apos;s new owner. </p>

<p>Officers responded to 745 Barbey Street near McClancy Place just before 1:00 p.m. on Monday, according to a spokeswoman for the NYPD. The remains were discovered in a second-floor bedroom. The body has yet to be identified, and the cause of death will be determined by the Medical Examiner. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201519/http://nypost.com/2016/02/29/fully-clothed-skeleton-found-in-vacant-apartment-building/">According to the Daily News</a>, the person may have been squatting on the property. </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s only one tooth so hopefully we can make an ID,&quot; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201519/http://nypost.com/2016/02/29/fully-clothed-skeleton-found-in-vacant-apartment-building/">told the NY Post</a>. </p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801201519/http://www.zillow.com/homes/745-Barbey-Street_rb/">listing</a> for the property on Zillow sets the foreclosure price for the single-family, circa 1925 home at $383,134, adding that the property is vandalized, has no functioning utilities and needs &quot;extensive work.&quot; The property is also listed as being sold &quot;as is&quot;&#x2014;a cryptic detail in retrospect. <br>
