<p>A man is in critical condition after falling five stories down a shaft inside a residential East Williamsburg building that is currently under construction, according to an FDNY spokeswoman.</p>

<p>Police and firefighters responded to 246 Johnson Avenue at the corner of Bushwick Place at 10:15 this morning. First responders discovered a man, whose name was not immediately released, with multiple body trauma. He was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital in critical condition. </p>

<p>The building under construction will be five stories with 32 apartments, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104033028/http://newyorkyimby.com/2014/10/permits-filed-246-johnson-avenue-east-williamsburg.html">according to New York Yimby</a>. The project permit also includes a 16-car garage. The building is replacing a one-story warehouse (pictured above). </p>

<p>The Department of Buildings is currently responding to the scene for an investigation, according to a spokesperson for the department. A complaint pertaining to the incident is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104033028/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=2&amp;vlcompdetlkey=0002047749">already listed on the DOB&apos;s website</a>. </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 3:00 p.m.:]</strong> A department of buildings spokesman said that investigators are on the scene, and that the man who fell was a construction worker. He also said that DOB has not confirmed how many stories the worker fell.</p>

<p>Coworkers also told the outlet that the victim was wearing a harness when he fell, though it wasn&apos;t immediately clear if the harness was secured. Economy Elevator Inc. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
