<p>White, orange and red-tinted plumes rising suspiciously from the top of 1 World Trade Center on Tuesday night were not smoke, officials confirmed, even as Twitter users asked, &quot;If I say it enough times, does that make it true?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801203422/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/inside_the_911_wtc_building_7_truth.php">Questions like these</a> are what make the World Trade Center so fascinating...  </p>

<p>What looked maybe-sort-of like billowy smoke and flame in numerous grainy pictures posted to social media was in fact water vapor rising from the HVAC system because it was cold out, according to the Port Authority. </p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s lit up by the tower lights,&#x201D; a construction supervisor on the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801203422/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/1-world-trade-center-smoke-scare-sends-panic-twitter-article-1.2526160">told the News</a>. &#x201C;It happens with fog and even clouds. It just looks like smoke.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Indeed: </p>
