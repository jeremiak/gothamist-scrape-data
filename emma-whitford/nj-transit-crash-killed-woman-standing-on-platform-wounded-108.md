<p>One person was killed and 108 people sustained injuries in this morning&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041306/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/29/nj_transit_hoboken_crash.php#photo-1">train crash at the Hoboken Terminal building in New Jersey</a>, according to the latest information from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Their information discounts earlier reports that at least three people had perished in the crash, which took place at approximately 8:45 a.m. on Thursday. &quot;Right now we don&apos;t have any reason to believe that there will be any further fatalities,&quot; Christie said.  </p>

<p>Christie and Cuomo held a joint press conference this afternoon, stressing that the cause of the crash is unknown and urging civilians not to speculate. </p>

<p>&quot;The one thing that we know is that the train came in at much too high a rate of speed. The question is, &apos;Why is that?&apos;&quot; Christie said. Though during a question-and-answer session with the press he added, &quot;We have no indication that this is anything but a tragic accident.&quot; </p>

<p>Christie did not confirm the identity of the female victim, pending family notification. He said that while the vast majority of injured were train passengers, the woman who died was standing on the platform, and was fatally struck by falling debris.

<p>&quot;The engineer was critically injured. He is at a local hospital and cooperating with law officials,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>According to NJ Transit, train #1614, a Pascack Valley train from Spring Valley en route to Hoboken, struck the Hoboken Terminal building on track five. &quot;There&apos;s an old-style ceiling that&apos;s in that portion of the station,&quot; Christie said. &quot;It took out a number of the supporting structures, collapsed the ceiling, and came to a stop at the wall that leads into the terminal.&quot; </p>

<p>As of this afternoon, there is no indication of when the Hoboken Terminal building will reopen for service, or when NJ Transit service will resume. However, the governors confirmed that PATH service is likely to resume as normal in time for this evening&apos;s rush hour. &quot;A few pilot trains will run in the next hour,&quot; said NJ Department of Transportation Chair Rick Hammer. </p>

<p>Christie stressed the severity of the terminal damage. &quot;First, there is the structural integrity of that portion of the building,&quot; he said. &quot;Second, the power supply to that part of the building. As soon as this [crash] happened there were wires everywhere,&quot; he said. We immediately cut power to that part of the building. So we have to determine when we can return power.&quot; </p>

<p>The suspended NJ Transit service will impact MetroNorth commuters en route to stops west of the Hudson, according to MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast. For those riders, the MTA will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041306/https://twitter.com/MTA/status/781499394621333504">cross-honoring monthly commuting tickets</a> with the Hudson line. Shuttle buses in Beacon and Tarrytown will provide service to the impacted stations, and will shuttle morning commuters back tomorrow assuming NJ Transit is still down. </p>

<p>There will also be expanded bus service on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041306/http://mybusnow.njtransit.com/bustime/wireless/html/selectstop.jsp?route=126&amp;direction=New+York">number 126 bus line</a> between Hoboken and Port Authority. More details on transit are available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041306/http://www.njtransit.com/sa/sa_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=CustomerNoticeTo&amp;NoticeId=2468">here</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;You will never have had a more coordinated approach between the MTA and NJ Transit,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;We are sharing equipment and resources in a way we never have before.&quot;</p>

<p>A National Transportation Safety Board investigation is underway. The Jersey City Medical Center hotline for family members is (201) 915-2691.</p>
