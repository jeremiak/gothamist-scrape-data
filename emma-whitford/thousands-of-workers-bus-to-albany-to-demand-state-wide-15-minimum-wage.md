<p>Backed by hissing hi-hats and screaming himself hoarse (&quot;Do we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://observer.com/2014/09/cuomo-and-hochul-rally-with-hotel-workers-union-ahead-of-primary/">HTC</a> in the house?

His wage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://labor.ny.gov/pressreleases/2015/september-10-2015-1.shtm">plan</a> calls for a phase-in to mirror the fast food worker wage increase announced last year&#x2014;$15 per hour by December 31st, 2018 for NYC, and by July 1st, 2021 for the rest of the state. </p>

<p>About 5,000 workers including custodians, nurse assistants, airport wheelchair attendants, healthcare workers and security guards traveled to the State capitol on Tuesday, in what a spokeswoman for the service workers union SEIU 32BJ called the &quot;largest rally to date in the fight for $15.&quot; The current minimum wage in New York State is $9 per hour. A win would make New York the first state in the country to enact a state-wide $15 minimum. </p>

<p>Comparing his own goals to Donald Trump&apos;s notorious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/jimmy_kimmel_trump_lol.php">immigration policy</a> (&quot;They say we want to make America great again, we say you don&apos;t know what makes America great in the first place&quot;), Cuomo promised that both policies will be built into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/state_of_the_state_cuomo.php">$150 billion State budget</a> up for vote on April 1st. &quot;We&apos;re gonna pass minimum wage! We&apos;re gonna pass paid leave!&quot; he shouted. </p>

<p>Republican Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan on Monday denied a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://nypost.com/2016/03/13/john-flanagan-close-to-15-minimum-wage-deal-with-cuomo/">report</a> that the republicans were ready to endorse the $15 minimum wage, albeit with a longer phase-in timetable, saying only that he was in the midst of &quot;very, very detailed discussions.&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/nyregion/as-deadline-nears-for-state-budget-assembly-and-senate-pass-different-versions.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur">The NY Times reports</a> that the paid leave proposal is closer to approval, although the financing details and length of leave (perhaps shorter than 12 weeks) is still being hashed out. </p>

<p>Among those opposing the $15 minimum wage is a contingent of small business owners, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://www.nfib.com/content/news/economy/main-street-matters-15hr-minimum-wage-threatens-small-business-73085/">argue</a> that owners of small business won&apos;t be able to absorb the wage increase without consequence. A 2010 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/workingpapers/157-07.pdf">study</a> by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/">Institute for Research Labor and Employment</a> found &#x201C;no evidence of job losses for high impact sectors such as restaurants and retail&quot; in US counties that implemented higher minimum wages over a 16-year period.</p>

<p>An eventual $15 minimum wage has already been secured for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/fast_food_workers_raise.php">New York fast food workers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/11/cuomo_announces_state-wide_15_minim.php">State workers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/de_blasio_city_minimum_wage.php">City workers</a> and SUNY workers, if not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719125801/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/minimum_wage_ny_suny.php">CUNY workers</a>. </p>

<p>Speaking with Gothamist on Tuesday, Sandra Luke, a wheelchair attendant at LaGuardia airport, said she was feeling hopeful. Luke, 56, lives in Flatbush, and helps support family in Trinidad with her $10.10/hour wage.  &quot;Trust me, a little more will never hurt nobody, you understand?&quot; she said, laughing. &quot;For now, if that&apos;s what they&apos;re offering we&apos;re grateful. But we could do with some more.&quot; </p>
