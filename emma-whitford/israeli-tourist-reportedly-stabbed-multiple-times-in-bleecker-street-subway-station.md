<p>A man was stabbed in the face, hands and arms during a possible attempted robbery on the Bleecker Street 6 train platform early Friday morning, according to the NYPD. The victim, who apparently does not speak fluent English, was waiting on the southbound 6 train platform when he was allegedly attacked. He is reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923055656/http://jpupdates.com/2016/04/08/nypd-hasidic-man-stabbed-multiple-times-at-manhattan-train-station/">visiting from Israel</a> (a police spokesperson said he was wearing &#x201C;traditional Hasidic clothing&#x201D;), and is currently hospitalized in stable condition. </p>

<p>Two good Samaritans notified NYPD officers of a stabbing victim at the Bleecker Street station around 3:30 a.m. on Friday, according to a spokesman for the department. Officers discovered the victim, believed to be in his 50s, with lacerations to his face, hands and arms. He was transported to Bellevue Hospital. </p>

<p>&quot;We just saw him coming up the subway steps and he was bleeding really heavily,&quot; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923055656/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-4-6-Trains-Skip-Bleecker-Street-Subway-Station-Man-Slashed-375004761.html">told NBC</a>. &quot;We helped him out. We put pressure on his wrists.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect took an indeterminate amount of money from the victim before fleeing the station, according to a preliminary investigation. The NYPD is looking for a black man with dreadlocks who was last seen wearing a brown jacket. The incident is not currently being investigated as a hate crime. </p>

<p>Southbound 6 trains were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923055656/http://www.mta.info/status/subway/456/24335370">still bypassing Bleecker Street</a> as of 8:30 this morning.</p>

<p>In January, a 71-year-old woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923055656/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/25/woman_slashed_on_6_train.php">was slashed</a> on the left side of her face on a southbound 6 train approaching Bleecker Street, in what was apparently a random assault.</p>
