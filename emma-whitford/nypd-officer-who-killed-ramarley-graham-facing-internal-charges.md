<p>Federal prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/ramarley_graham_feds_nypd.php">announced earlier this week</a> that they will not pursue criminal charges against the NYPD officer who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/03/cop_kills_unarmed_18-year-old_in_hi.php">shot and killed</a> Bronx teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/https://www.google.com/search?q=Ramarley+Graham+gothamist&amp;oq=Ramarley+Graham+gothamist&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.1190j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">Ramarley Graham</a> inside of his home in 2012, and now the NYPD is finally moving forward on their internal investigation of his actions.</p>

<p>&quot;Normally, when the federal agencies begin an investigation, usually a civil rights investigation, we take a step back until they finish their investigation, and that&apos;s what we did,&#x201D; NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/nyregion/officer-in-fatal-shooting-of-ramarley-graham-faces-police-dept-charges.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the NY Times</a>. The NYPD first filed disciplinary charges against officer Richard Haste and two other officers from his unit in June 2012.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara stated earlier this week that his office lacked sufficient evidence to meet the &quot;high burden of proof&quot; required for criminal prosecution against Haste, in large part because investigators determined that no one witnessed the shooting (Graham&apos;s grandmother and six-year-old brother were, however, inside the apartment at the time). </p>

<p>Graham&apos;s mother Constance Malcolm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://www.blackwestchester.com/constance-calls-bratton-a-bald-face-liar/">protested on the steps of City Hall</a> on Thursday, demanding that Haste and the other officers in his unit be fired immediately. According to Malcolm and her supporters, Bharara told them in the meeting that he had never told the NYPD to postpone their internal investigation. Bharara&apos;s office declined to comment on the meeting. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-commissioner-bratton-lied-ramarley-graham_us_56e18716e4b065e2e3d4e81e">The Huffington Post asked</a> the NYPD&apos;s director of communications, Peter Donald, why they hadn&apos;t finished the internal investigation in the four years since Graham was killed.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;As long as anyone here [at the NYPD] can remember, this is the way it was done,&quot; Donald said.

<p>But when pressed about the case of former NYPD Officer Francis Livoti -- who the NYPD fired in 1997 before the conclusion of a DOJ investigation into the death of Anthony Baez -- Donald demurred. </p>

<p>That was &quot;20 years ago,&quot; he said of the Livoti case.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Officer Haste, formerly a member of the NYPD&apos;s narcotics unit, was watching a Wakefield bodega on February 2, 2012 when he was alerted that Graham, standing nearby, possibly had a gun. Haste then followed Graham to his home, and charged into the house and up a back stairwell to a second-floor bathroom, where he fatally shot Graham as the teenager leaned over the toilet. </p>

<p>The officer later testified that he believed Graham was reaching for a gun, but investigators didn&apos;t recover a weapon from the scene. Marijuana was found in the toilet, suggesting that Graham had leaned down to dump it. </p>

<p>Haste was originally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/indictment_against_cop_who_killed_u.php">indicted</a> by a Bronx grand jury on two counts of manslaughter, but the case was ultimately thrown out due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/indictment_against_cop_who_killed_u.php">a technicality</a>. Another grand jury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/08/nypd_officer_who_shot_ramarley_grah.php">declined to indict Haste</a>, deciding that the case lacked sufficient evidence. The officer, who has been on desk duty since the incident, recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160517053622/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ramarley-graham-nypd-richard-haste_us_567455d4e4b0b958f6567aa0">got a raise</a>.</p>

<p>Following Bharara&apos;s decision, Graham&apos;s family denounced the Department of Justice and the NYPD. &quot;With this justice system, it doesn&apos;t seem like our kid&apos;s life matters,&quot; said Malcolm. &quot;Time and time again, you see it over and over, these officers walk free, they get a pay raise, they get a promotion, and nothing has been done to them.&quot; </p>

<p>Bratton has the final say in internal cases, and the maximum punishment Haste faces is dismissal from the department. </p>
