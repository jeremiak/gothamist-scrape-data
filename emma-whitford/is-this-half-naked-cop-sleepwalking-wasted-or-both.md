<p>An NYPD officer who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104406/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/good_cop_bad_cop_same_cop.php">accused in 2014</a> of breaking into a woman&apos;s home in his boxers and assaulting her, just hours after being honored with the NYPD&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104406/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/25/after_being_honored_by_de_blasio_co.php">second-highest achievement medal</a>, made the case in court last month that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104406/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/good_cop_bad_cop_same_cop.php">he was sleepwalking</a>&#x2014;not intoxicated&#x2014;when he broke down the woman&apos;s door, allegedly struck her 20 times, and quaffed milk from her refrigerator.</p>

<p>Now the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104406/http://nypost.com/2016/04/02/sleepwalk-assault-cop-caught-running-in-nothing-but-his-undies/">has acquired</a> &quot;damning&quot; surveillance footage of 27-year-old Eugene Donnelly running about in his boxers near the entrance of a Bronx apartment building, performing complex tasks like bounding up and down stairs, opening and closing doors, and even pressing apartment buzzers. According to the tabloid, the footage was taken around 5:45 on the morning of June 10, 2014, right after Donnelly allegedly assaulted a woman inside. He&apos;s since been charged with misdemeanor assault and burglary. </p>

<p>According to a preliminary investigation, Donnelly decided to crash at a friend&apos;s Woodlawn apartment the night of his award ceremony, and at some point strayed in his boxers, ultimately mistaking the victim&apos;s apartment for his friend&apos;s. While sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104406/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-drunk-nearly-naked-hero-found-stranger-apartment-receiving-medal-article-1.1842851">told the Daily News</a> at the time that Donnelly had been out drinking that night, his attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104406/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-sleepwalking-assaulted-woman-lawyer-article-1.2581550">told reporters</a> that his own report shows &quot;that it wasn&apos;t an alcoholic blackout. It was sleepwalking,&quot; adding that his client suffers from PTSD. </p>

<p>Donnelly&apos;s alleged victim later testified in court that he pounced on her bed in his underwear, beat her, and went for the fridge before fleeing. According to a police report from that night, Donnelly allegedly said to the woman, &quot;Shhh, It&apos;s OK. Just put a shirt on,&quot; and then, &quot;Sometimes I&apos;m a good guy, but sometimes I&apos;m a bad guy.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104406/http://www.sleepeducation.org/sleep-disorders-by-category/parasomnias/sleepwalking/overview-facts">experts at Sleepwalking Education</a>, somnambulists can handle pretty advanced motor skills: </p>

<blockquote>Sleepwalking occurs when you get up from bed and walk around even though you are still asleep. It can also involve a series of other complex actions. Before walking, you might sit up in bed and look around in a confused manner. At other times, individuals may bolt from the bed and walk or run away. They may be frantic to escape from a threat that they dreamed or imagined.

<p>You might talk or shout as you are walking. Your eyes are usually open and have a confused, &#x201C;glassy&#x201D; look to them. You might begin doing routine daily actions that are not normally done at night.</p>

<p>More often, it involves actions that are crude, strange, or in the wrong place. This might include urinating in a trash can, moving furniture around, or climbing out of a window. It can also result in hostile and violent behavior.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Donnelly&apos;s lawyer Michael Marinaccio told the Post his client was &quot;obviously awakened&quot; by the time he ran into the frame (though he is upholding that Donnelly was sleepwalking during the assault). What say <em>you</em>? </p>
