<p>Brownsville rapper Troy Ave today announced that he&apos;s filing a lawsuit against the Manhattan venue Irving Plaza, alleging that security guards failed to keep guns out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/26/irving_plaza_shooting_nyc.php">T.I. concert that left his friend and bodyguard Ronald &quot;Banga&quot; McPhatter dead</a>, and himself and two others injured. </p>

<p>&quot;This morning, we have filed a lawsuit against Irving Plaza and Live Nation on behalf of Troy Ave for the lack of security they provided the night of the incident,&quot; his lawyer Scott Leemon said Monday. &quot;Troy did not bring the gun into the venue and if the security had done their job none of the injuries, including Troy getting shot, would have occurred. The venue had a duty to protect Troy, as an invited performer, and they failed him miserably.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The May 25th shooting broke out around 10:00 p.m. in a VIP area on the upper level of Irving Plaza. T.I., who was headlining that night, hadn&apos;t performed yet&#x2014;openers Maino and Uncle Murda were on stage when shots sent concert goers scrambling out of the venue. At least five shots were fired over the course of several minutes; McPhatter was fatally shot in the stomach. </p>

<p>Troy Ave, legal name Roland Collins, has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/31/troy_ave_arraignment.php">accused</a> of killing McPhatter. He&apos;s currently out on $500,000 bail, having been charged with attempted murder and gun possession. Collins sustained a gunshot wound to the leg the night of the T.I. concert, and was hospitalized for several days following. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/26/police_arrest_one_for_irving_plaza.php">Security camera footage</a> shows a suspect, apparently Collins, firing shots inside Irving Plaza that night, and prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rapper-charged-irving-plaza-shooting-claims-victim-article-1.2654978">say</a> three guns, including one that matched the gun that shot McPhatter, were recovered from the car that drove Collins to the hospital. </p>

<p>But a draft of today&apos;s suit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160805/midtown-east/adopt-kitten-at-urban-outfitters-this-weekend">acquired by DNAinfo</a>, alleges that another person shot Collins twice as he entered a backstage room at the venue, and that the same person fatally shot McPhatter. Before the shooting broke out, the suit alleges, security guards let Collins and other artists into the venue through a VIP entrance, without doing a weapons check&#x2014;no one was patted down and there were no metal detectors. </p>

<p>Collins&apos;s lawyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rapper-troy-ave-sue-irving-plaza-live-nation-shooting-article-1.2742795">told the Daily News</a> that Collins grabbed the gun from the shooter and fired at that person in self defense&#x2014;the moment captured on surveillance footage and circulated widely. </p>

<p>His lawyers made a similar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/31/troy_ave_arraignment.php">self-defense claim</a> during Collins&apos;s May indictment, stating that the video didn&apos;t show the whole story. </p>

<p>&quot;As a result of the incident, the plaintiff, a 30-year-old promising performer with his entire career ahead of him, has been left with disabling injuries which will forever affect his life, his career and his pursuits,&quot; the suit states. </p>

<p>No one else has been charged in McPhatter&apos;s death as of this week, and the Manhattan DA&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rapper-troy-ave-sue-irving-plaza-live-nation-shooting-article-1.2742795">has indicated</a> that Collins is still being investigated. The rapper is wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet as a condition of his bail, and has been banned from all concert venues, bars and clubs. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161230044842/http://www.livenation.com/">Live Nation Worldwide</a>, which owns Irving Plaza, declined to comment on the suit. </p>
