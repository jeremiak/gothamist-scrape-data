title: And How Was YOUR Swim To Work Today?

										<p>The weather gods <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073015/http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=OKX&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1&amp;highlight=off">say</a> it&apos;s going to keep raining all day and into early tomorrow, and while it&apos;s not uncommon to see commuters slogging to work through knee-high muck in low-lying coastal neighborhoods like, say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073015/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/09/queens_flooding_high_tides.php#photo-1">Broad Channel</a>, some Bed-Stuy residents were surprised to encounter a mini-lake of sewer water on Halsey Street this morning. </p>

<p>Jeff Coltin came across this swampy scene at Halsey and Throop around 9:40 a.m. He figured the puddle was about a foot deep and 10 feet wide.  </p>

<p>&quot;That area of Throop is low-lying and there&apos;s always more rain, but this was the worst I&apos;d ever seen it,&quot; he told us. &quot;It just seemed like drains were clogged with leaves.&quot; </p>

<p>Cars, he added, &quot;kept blasting through&quot; even though the water was up to their headlights. </p>

<p>Coltin said that the leaf-clearers didn&apos;t appear to be city workers, just good Samaritans. The Department of Sanitation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317073015/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/stormwater/flooding_causes.shtml">says</a> this kind of backlog can happen in street catch basins pretty quickly, in case you feel compelled to jump into action and help out with your hands/long metal poll next time: </p>

<blockquote>...rainwater&#x2014;especially during very intense storms&#x2014;scours streets and sidewalks like a fire hose, pushing debris like leaves, gum wrappers and restaurant menus on to the catch basin where it molds itself into a sort of mat. Such debris can block the grate so completely that water cannot enter the storm sewers. Instead, it pools around the basin, causing flooding even before the sewer is full.</blockquote>

<p>In any case, here&apos;s hoping your jeans aren&apos;t still sticking to your legs.  </p>
