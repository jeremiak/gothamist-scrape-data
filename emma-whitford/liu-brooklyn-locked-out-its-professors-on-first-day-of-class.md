<p>Valerie Rufo reported to a cafeteria for the first class of her senior year at Long Island University&apos;s Brooklyn campus on Wednesday. The lecture, a nursing requirement, had been combined with four other sections in a single room. Rufo estimated that there were about 100 students assigned to one professor&#x2014;an interim, who said she typically taught at Adelphi University. </p>

<p>&quot;She was trying to teach but nothing was really correlating with our syllabus, so we just left class,&quot; Rufo said. &quot;Even if you wanted to write something, you were writing on your lap. It took her about half an hour to get her PowerPoint working.&quot; </p>

<p>Outside, dozens of full-time and adjunct professors marched beneath a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflatable_rat">giant blow-up rat</a>&#x2014;which unions use to draw attention to the use of non-union labor&#x2014;protesting the university&apos;s decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/http://www.liu.edu/About/News/Univ-Ctr-PR/2016/September/LIU-Brooklyn-Fall-Semester-Begins-Sept-7-2016">bar the entirety of its unionized teaching staff from campus</a>. Over Labor Day weekend, about 400 faculty members were informed that they will not be welcome on campus until an agreement is reached on their five-year contract, which expired on August 31st. Their health insurance was suspended, and they were locked out of their e-mail accounts. </p>

<p>Interim teachers have been recruited from other schools. While LIU described these professors as &quot;adjuncts with advanced degrees,&quot; students said some are teaching assistants, and many don&apos;t seem qualified. Some work in administrative offices at LIU, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/http://www.liuff.net/">Long Island University Faculty Federation (LIUFF)</a>, LIU Brooklyn&apos;s teacher union. </p>

<p>&quot;The weirdest thing they did was bring in these sort-of pretend teachers,&quot; said Lewis Warsh, 71, a tenured Creative Writing and Literature professor. &quot;Nobody knows even what their qualifications are to teach.&quot; </p>

<p>The tactic, called a lockout, is different from a strike in that the union members have no choice in the matter. &#xFEFF;Kevin Pollitt, a labor relations specialist with New York State United Teachers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/https://www.thenation.com/article/classes-start-at-liu-brooklyn-on-september-7-but-faculty-are-locked-out/">told The Nation</a> this week that, to his knowledge, this is the first time a higher-education faculty has ever been locked out. </p>

<p>&quot;This started out as a fight for our faculty, but the broader, deeper implications are really terrifying for higher education,&quot; said Andrea Libin, an adjunct professor in the English department. &quot;That a precedent could be set of trying to break the union and bringing in outsiders.&quot; </p>

<p>One of LIUFF&apos;s goals is to secure higher starting wages for professors, equal to those at LIU&apos;s C.W. Post campus in Nassau County. Brooklyn professors worry that their campus, which serves more black, Latino and low-income students than C.W. Post, is undervalued by the administration. Tuition is the same at both campuses&#x2014;$34,352 per year. </p>

<p>Teachers also maintain that the contract should include higher base-pay for adjunct professors, who typically have fewer benefits, lower salaries, and less of a say in their teaching schedules than full-time staff. </p>

<p>The base salary for new professors at the C.W. Post campus is $96,000, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160902/downtown-brooklyn/professors-locked-out-of-liu-brooklyn-amid-contract-fight-for-more-pay">according to DNAinfo</a>, while the base salary for full professors LIU Brooklyn outlined in the new contract is $80,000. Faculty are more likely to be hired as assistant professors, who would make $65,747 under the proposed contract&#x2014;compared to $76,971 at Post&#x2014;or instructors, who would make $59,158, compared to $69,335 at Post.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m a full professor,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;The equivalent person at Post is making $10,000 more than I am. How did that happen?&quot; </p>

<p>Faculty say that LIU President Kimberly Cline, who took office in 2013, has been focused on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/http://www.seawanhakapress.com/2016/04/21/liu-president-kimberly-cline-declares-campus-crisis-over-liuff-responds/">improving the school&apos;s credit rating</a> (which was very low when she took office), to the detriment of teachers&apos; well-being and the quality of education at LIU. </p>

<p>The administration has countered that the contract it&apos;s proposed is part of a broader commitment to keep tuition increases at or under two percent, through 2020. In a letter to the student body, Dr. Jeffrey Kane, Senior VP of Academic Affairs, said that, &quot;With the understanding that every additional dollar spent on faculty salaries and benefits is a dollar not spent on student scholarships, new labs and facilities or campus safety, we&apos;ve offered the faculty a generous proposal.&quot; </p>

<p>Students accused the university of attempting to pit them against their teachers. They staged a sit-in on Wednesday and circulated flyers urging their fellow students to walk out of classes. &quot;We&apos;ve gotten so close to these people,&quot; said Stephanie Fermin, 24, a graduate student studying speech therapy. &quot;They do so much more than just teach, and you&apos;re going to send someone else in here?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The tuition is still very high,&quot; added Leauntea Gillian, 19, a sophomore studying Sociology and Business. No one showed up to teach her English class Wednesday morning. &quot;We should all get discounts for the classes, or at least get some kind of refund, if they are going to keep classes running but not teach us. It doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot; </p>

<p>The LIU administration has also said that the lockout is in the students&apos; best interest, based on the union&apos;s historical willingness to strike. In May, the union voted in favor of possibly striking if negotiations went south, though a lawyer for the union <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/nyregion/liu-brooklyn-locks-out-professors-amid-contract-dispute.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a> that the move is standard&#x2014;&quot;something to have in our back pocket.&quot; During 2011 contract negotiations, LIU professors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/http://www.psc-cuny.org/clarion/september-2011/faculty-strike-wins-imperfect-victory-liu">went on strike</a> for several days before the contract was settled. </p>

<p>&quot;These work stoppages were designed to cause the most disruption and impact to the student learning experience,&quot; LIU stated. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;d like to ask them now how it&apos;s worked out today,&quot; said Emily Drabinski, an associate professor and university librarian, from the picket line. &quot;If they&apos;ve prevented chaos.&quot; </p>

<p>Drabinski showed Gothamist an email from LIU administrators, stating that temporary instructors will receive $500 per day for the first two days of the lockout, and up to $3,000 for teaching an entire course. For comparison, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145936/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/an-unprecedented-faculty-lockout/499016/">the Atlantic spoke to a current adjunct</a> who said he made about $1,800 per course, and stood to lose income under the proposed contract thanks to the possible elimination of paid office hours and an adjunct benefits trust fund. </p>

<p>&quot;This [money] could cover a bunch of the things faculty are asking for and the administration is saying they can&apos;t afford,&quot; she said. &quot;This is about power, not money. They simply want to eliminate the power that faculty have as a unionized workforce.&quot; </p>

<p>In response to student&apos;s concerns about their Monday classes, LIU Vice President Gale Haynes said, &quot;By and large classes are staffed by qualified teachers and the semester is moving forward.&quot; </p>

<p>LIUFF rejected LIU&apos;s latest contract offer on Tuesday. &quot;The University will continue to bargain in good faith, with the goal of welcoming its valued faculty back to the classroom upon timely resolution of the contract,&quot; Haynes said. </p>
