<p>The NYPD has acquired crystal-clear surveillance footage of two young men who they believe climbed the fire escape of a Soho storage facility in December. After spraying the exterior wall with graffiti, they allegedly entered the building from the roof. One of the men was apparently wearing a blue jacket with an NYPD patch. </p>

<p>The incident took place just before 2:00 a.m. on Monday December 7th at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171316/http://www.sofiastorage.com/our-locations/">Sofia Storage</a> on Franklin Street at the corner of Varick Street, according to the NYPD. The police are investigating the incident as a burglary, although there&apos;s no evidence that the wall-scaling suspects took anything from inside the warehouse. </p>

<p>One of the men has been identified as an NYPD impersonator, although it would be hard to confuse him with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171316/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/cyclist_activists_detained_for_impe.php">these guys</a>. </p>

The public can also submit their tips by logging onto Crime Stoppers&apos; website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171316/http://a056-crimestoppers.nyc.gov/crimestoppers/public/index.html">www.nypdcrimestoppers.com</a> or by texting their tips to CRIMES (274637), then enter TIP577.</p>
