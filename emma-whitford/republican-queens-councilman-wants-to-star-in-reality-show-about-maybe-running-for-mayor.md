<p>Now that President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/pervy_trump_sexist_pig.php">&quot;You&apos;re fired!&quot;</a> elect Donald Trump has not just blurred but thoroughly erased the line between political campaign and reality television, a Republican Queens councilman has stars in his eyes. Eric Ulrich, the 31-year-old Queens native who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://www.qchron.com/editions/central/maspeth-to-protest-at-city-hall-on-friday/article_6131fb60-64ee-5695-a301-534432d6a6bb.html">dislikes new homeless shelters</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://www.rockawave.com/news/2015-05-15/Top_Stories/Ulrich_Says_Bag_The_Tax.html">plastic bag taxes</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/15/bike_license_councilman_cyclists_br.php">once made a case</a> that cyclists should be licensed, has City approval to consider a possible mayoral run with a camera crew in tow. </p>

<p>&quot;I anticipate giving them as much access as I possibly can,&quot; Ulrich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/04/nyregion/reality-show-would-follow-new-york-city-councilmans-mayoral-dreams.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion">told the NY Times</a>. &quot;I won&apos;t be holding anything back.&quot; Fasten your seat belts, America.</p>

<p>Ulrich hasn&apos;t officially declared he&apos;ll run for mayor, but he&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/republian-eric-ulrich-mulls-mayoral-run-de-blasio-2017-article-1.2633740">fundraising since the spring</a>, and is openly critical of Mayor de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/https://twitter.com/eric_ulrich/status/803931291276214272">homelessness policy</a> and heavily-redacted correspondences with so-called &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/20/power_corrupts_park_slopers_absolutely.php">agents of the city</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>The show, if it were to be picked up, would likely play up the drama of a Republican candidate considering a mayoral run in a solidly Democrat town. The NY Times reports that approval for the show was granted by the city&apos;s Conflicts of Interest Board, on the grounds that Ulrich doesn&apos;t accept payment or disclose confidential information. </p>

<p>&quot;This is the first step,&quot; Kevin Tschirhart, a spokesman for Ulrich, told Gothamist. &quot;In the next couple of weeks they are going to start filming him in his office, out in the district, possibly at home, and possibly at City Hall.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They will create a sizzle reel and a five-minute extended trailer,&quot; he added. &quot;The producers will then sell that to television networks. The concept is more of a documentary series, more fly-on-the-wall style. When you think of reality TV you think of people throwing drinks at people&apos;s faces.&quot; </p>

<p>Producers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023601/http://www.bradtrackman.com/">Brad Trackman</a> and Johnny Russo are reportedly confident about the show, which they&apos;re planning to pitch at a reality TV conference in Washington next month. The reel will likely include scenes from Ozone Park, where Ulrich has a district office, and Lindenwood, where he lives with his wife and four-year-old daughter (who would also apparently get camera time). </p>

<p>Asked if the Mayor&apos;s Office had a comment on the possible show, Mayoral Spokesman Eric Phillips said, simply, &quot;No.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Representing New Yorkers in the City Council is a tremendous responsibility which is why the Speaker banned outside income and made serving in elected office a full time job,&quot; said Robin Levine, a spokeswoman for City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. &quot;We expect all of our members to present themselves in the appropriate and professional manner befitting of public office.&quot;</p>
