<p>After months of tracking a noticeable increase in dead birds, cats and squirrels in his neighborhood, a Bay Ridge man managed to capture surveillance footage of an unidentified person knocking a bird feeder onto the sidewalk, spreading the seed on the ground, and later drenching it in a bright green liquid that the NYPD believes to have been antifreeze. </p>

<p>&quot;This stuff is on the sidewalk and on the ground&#x2014;any dog can track it, any dog can lick it; any kid can eat it,&quot; 24-year-old Brian Baglioni <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712005235/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/03/01/neighbors-man-caught-on-video-poisoning-animals-in-bay-ridge-brooklyn/">told CBS</a>, which acquired a copy of his footage taken on January 18th. &quot;It&apos;s a danger to everybody; every living thing.&quot; </p>

<p>Disturbing reports of animal poisoning have been cited in Bay Ridge since August. Last fall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712005235/http://www.brooklyndaily.com/stories/2015/47/br-cat-killer-2015-11-20-bk.html">Brooklyn Daily reported</a> that an unknown assailant was setting out wet cat food mixed with poison and crushed glass, and sprinkling a mixture of sugar and insecticide on sidewalks. The traps were set on 90 and 92nd Streets between Ridge Boulevard, and Fourth Avenue, according to residents. The NYPD apparently confiscated poisoned pet food from a neighbor in November, but the attacks have continued. </p>

<p>Baglioni <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712005235/http://nypost.com/2016/03/01/some-maniac-is-fatally-poisoning-animals-in-brooklyn/">told the NY Post</a> this week that he believes nearly 100 birds, four stray cats, some squirrels and a dog have been killed since August. In hopes of catching the attacker or attackers, he and some neighbors have started posting signs: &#x201C;Warning &#x2014; animals are being poisoned in Bay Ridge. Cats, squirrels and birds are suffering extremely painful deaths. WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!&quot;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the NYPD confirmed that the Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad is actively investigating the dead animal reports. <br>
