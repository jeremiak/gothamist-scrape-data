<p>In her final state of the city address on Thursday, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito pledged her commitment to ensuring free birth control for every woman in New York City, despite efforts in Washington to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/12/affordable_care_act_repeal_vote.php">repeal the Affordable Care Act</a>&#x2014;and with it, the right to copay-free contraception&#x2014;as well as President Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/http://dcist.com/2017/01/trump_gives_the_supreme_court_nomin.php">commitment</a> to anti-abortion Supreme Court judges. </p>

<p>&quot;The Council will work to provide all women in New York City with free access to birth control, including City workers who are currently in &apos;grandfathered&apos; plans,&quot; her office announced. &quot;The Council will also continue its support of a stand-alone fund for birth control.&quot; </p>

<p>The speaker&apos;s plan targets women who slip through the cracks of the already imperiled ACA: those who are uninsured, undocumented, or have old &quot;grandfathered&quot; insurance plans that don&apos;t adhere to ACA guidelines. It could also offer an alternative to women who don&apos;t feel comfortable using a family plan for contraceptives. </p>

<p>The concept is to expand an existing City Council fund for IUDs and other long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) instated last year, following a 2016 proposal from Mark-Viverito&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/http://www.shewillbe.nyc/YWI-Report-and-Recommendations.pdf">Young Women&apos;s Initiative</a>. The speaker is going to push for this money to be &quot;baselined and expanded,&quot; her office said. IUDs, an alternative to oral contraception, are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/free_iud_implant_planned_parenthood.php">no small investment</a> without insurance. The total cost of the medical exam, IUD insertion, and followup visits ranges from $500 to $900, according to Planned Parenthood. Removal can cost up to $300.</p>

<p>Emily Kadar, who manages government affairs for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/https://www.google.com/search?q=National+Institute+for+Reproductive+Health&amp;oq=National+Institute+for+Reproductive+Health&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.515j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">National Institute for Reproductive Health</a>, told Gothamist that she believes that the speaker&apos;s proposal is a strong and attainable one, considering that insurance policy is decided at the State level. But she added that it would hardly cover the city&apos;s demand if the ACA were to be repealed. </p>

<p>Legislation currently pending at the state level <em>would</em> likely make up the difference. The Comprehensive Contraception Coverage Act, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/obamacare_ny_contraception.php">recently passed by the Assembly</a>, would require insurers in New York to provide copay-free coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptives. Emergency contraception like Plan B, which typically costs at least $50 without a prescription, would be covered over the counter&#x2014;an expansion on the ACA. Male contraceptives would be covered, as well.</p>

<p>But the CCCA also has to pass the Republican-majority state Senate, where it stalled last year. </p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-decisive-actions-secure-access-reproductive-health-services-new-york">added his two cents late last month</a>, drafting an insurance code regulation that would require insurers to provide most contraception and abortion services without a copay or deductible. But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/NSTextP62_48.pdf">draft regulation</a> has a significant exception for &quot;religious employers and qualified religious organization employers&quot;: the logic upheld in the Supreme Court&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/magazine/what-the-hobby-lobby-ruling-means-for-america.html">Hobby Lobby decision</a>. </p>

<p>Cuomo&apos;s regulation is still pending, and could go into effect next month following a 45-day comment period. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the governor didn&apos;t immediately comment on the decision to include a religious exception. </p>

<p>The State Assembly has also passed, for the second time, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222063155/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/26/abortion_reform_new_york.php">Reproductive Health Act</a>&#x2014;legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade at the state level, protecting, and expanding, the right to abortion in New York in the face of conservative Supreme Court appointments. </p>

<p>It, too, has historically been shut down in the Senate. Mark-Viverito has pledged to lobby for the RHA, calling it &quot;more important now than ever.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 5 p.m.]:</strong> &quot;The regulations put forward ensure access and coverage for all contraceptive drugs and devices for women in New York,&quot; said Cuomo spokeswoman Abbey Fashouer in a statement, adding that the religious exemption &quot;simply mirrors federal law&quot; and requires the insurer to provide coverage if an employer opts out. </p>
