<p>Two men in their fifties were discovered with fatal gunshot wounds to the head inside of a Staten Island business on Tuesday evening, according to the NYPD. One of the victims has been identified as 57-year-old Michael Genovese of New Jersey, reportedly the owner of the company, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723043556/http://www.universalmerchantfunding.com/">sells loans to small businesses</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723043556/http://nypost.com/2017/01/24/two-killed-execution-style-at-mortgage-office-in-staten-island/">The NY Post reports</a> that the second victim was a colleague of Genovese, 52-year-old Carl Clark, though police could only confirm his age.  </p>

<p>Cops responded to a call of shots fired at 124 Buel Avenue in Dongan Hills just before 6:15 p.m., according to the department. EMS declared both victims dead on the scene. </p>

<p>Addressing reporters Wednesday morning, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said he believed at least one of the victims was targeted by the shooter. </p>

<p>&quot;The case has advanced quickly overnight,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723043556/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/robbery-not-motive-executions-staten-island-men-nypd-article-1.2955167">said</a> earlier today. &quot;We don&apos;t believe it&apos;s a robbery. We believe one or two of these males were purposefully targeted by the shooter.&quot;</p>

<p>Each victim was &quot;shot three times at close range,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>A law enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723043556/http://nypost.com/2017/01/25/ex-employee-executed-boss-colleague-over-money-gripe/">tells the Post</a> that the shooter is now believed to be a &quot;disgruntled&quot; former employee of Genovese. The source tells the tabloid that the ex-employee, who has not yet been named, showed up at the office last night armed and wearing a mask.</p>

<p>One man who described himself as a former employee told the Post that Genovese was a &quot;good guy&quot; if &quot;a little wild.&quot; Clark was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723043556/http://nypost.com/2012/06/12/whistleblower-axed-after-exposing-sale-of-secret-data/">reportedly a whistle-blower,</a> having been fired from a previous job after filing a complaint that his employer, the shareholder advisory firm ISS, had been selling clients&apos; voting data. </p>

<p>According to an NYPD spokesman, a witness reported seeing the suspect exit the Buel Avenue address in a dark hooded sweatshirt with a balaclava covering the lower part of his face, carrying an umbrella. Cops believe he fled in grey vehicle, possibly a Hyundai or Acura sedan. No arrests have been made as of Wednesday. </p>
