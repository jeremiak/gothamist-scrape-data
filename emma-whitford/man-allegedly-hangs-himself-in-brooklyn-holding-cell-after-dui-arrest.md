<p>Police say a 28-year-old man used his own T-shirt to hang himself inside of a holding cell at a Brooklyn police station on Sunday evening, after being arrested for driving under the influence in Canarsie earlier that day. </p>

<p>Police responded to a car crash in front of 9011 Avenue J near the corner of East 91st Street in Canarsie just before 12:45 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. Upon arrival, they determined that one of the drivers, a 28-year-old man, was intoxicated. The driver was arrested and taken to the Intoxicated Driver Testing Unit at the 78th Precinct in Park Slope for blood alcohol testing, before being transported to the 69th Precinct in Canarsie for processing. </p>

<p>At 5:30 p.m., officers discovered the driver unconscious and unresponsive in his cell. He was transported to Brookdale Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>While the official cause of death has yet to be determined by the Medical Examiner, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507204949/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/nyregion/man-28-is-found-hanged-in-brooklyn-police-station.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a> that the man hanged himself with his t-shirt. </p>

<p>Police are withholding the man&apos;s name until his family is notified. <br>
