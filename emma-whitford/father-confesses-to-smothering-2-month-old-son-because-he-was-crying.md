<p>A Bronx woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427040809/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/20/mothers_confession_leads_cops_to_di.php"> confessed to a psychiatrist</a> last week that her boyfriend killed her 2-month-old baby&#x2014;and that the couple subsequently dumped the child&apos;s remains in a wooded area in Dutchess County. Now her boyfriend has been arrested and charged with murder. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, detectives from the 49th Precinct in the Bronx were informed on Friday that a 2-month-old boy had died inside of 1849 Bogart Avenue near Rhinelander Avenue in the Bronx a day previous. Retracing steps described by the victim&apos;s mother, officers discovered the body of Mason Whyte in the woods near Kitchen Corner Road and Route 22 in the upstate town of Dover. </p>

<p>The infant&apos;s mother, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427040809/http://nypost.com/2015/12/20/moms-confession-leads-cops-to-infants-body/">identified by the Post</a> as one Danielle Whyte, 31, made her confession at New York Presbyterian Hospital in White Plains after attempting to commit suicide by overdosing on pills, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427040809/http://abc7ny.com/news/father-charged-with-death-of-2-month-old-son;-boy-buried-in-wooded-area/1129986/">ABC reports</a>. </p>

<p>Officers arrested the child&apos;s father, 51-year-old Jose Feliciano of the Bronx, on Sunday and charged him with second-degree murder, manslaughter and manslaughter of a child under the age of 11. Feliciano is believed to have choked and smothered the child because he would not stop crying, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427040809/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/nyregion/police-say-bronx-father-choked-baby-and-disposed-of-body-upstate.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">according to the NY Times</a>. </p>

<p>Surveillance footage acquired by the paper shows Feliciano carrying a red duffle bag out of his Bronx home on the night of the murder, putting the bag in his trunk, and driving away. Authorities believe that the infant&apos;s body was in the bag. </p>

<p>Feliciano&apos;s building supervisor told the Post that he spoke frequently with Feliciano about the infant, and that Feliciano often said he was &quot;always crying&quot; and, &quot;I can never sleep.&quot; </p>

<p>An investigation into the murder is ongoing, including Whyte&apos;s involvement.</p>

The couple allegedly drove more than 50 miles upstate and checked into the Heidi&apos;s Inn motel on Route 22 before burying the body in nearby woods. </p>
