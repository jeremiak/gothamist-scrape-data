<p>A teenager jumped into the path of an oncoming 6 train at Canal Street on Wednesday night to save a fellow straphanger who had allegedly fallen drunkenly onto the tracks, according to the NYPD. The good Samaritan was uninjured, and the man he saved was hospitalized with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122628/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160526/soho/man-saves-straphanger-who-fell-into-path-of-oncoming-6-train-nypd-says">an arm injury</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;All of a sudden, before I knew it, he fell down on the track. He was sort of splayed across the track in the middle and wasn&apos;t moving,&quot; 19-year-old Nicholas Buxton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122628/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Strangers-Save-Man-Fall-Subway-Tracks-Approaching-Train-380905191.html">told NBC</a>. Buxton reportedly jumped down after the man when he saw a 6 train approaching northbound. </p>

<p>&quot;I went down immediately. He was too heavy to move, and I yelled for help because by that point, I could see the train,&quot; Buxton added. According to the news outlet, the teenager managed to push the fallen man underneath the lip of the platform before another passenger hoisted him to safety. The train narrowly avoided the fallen man as it pulled into the station. </p>

<p>A spokesman for the NYPD said officers responded to the scene shortly after 8:00 p.m., and determined that the victim had been pushed to safety by a fellow straphanger. Police say the drunken man, whose age could not be confirmed, was extracted from underneath the train platform and transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.</p>
