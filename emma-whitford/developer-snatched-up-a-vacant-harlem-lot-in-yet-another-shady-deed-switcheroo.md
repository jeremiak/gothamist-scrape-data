<p>After luxury condominium developers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/les_luxury_condos_everywhere.php">purchased 45 Rivington Street on the Lower East Side for $116 million</a> in March, members of the community were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/45_rivington_press_conference.php">incensed to learn</a> that the deed restriction requiring it to act as a nonprofit residential healthcare facility had been quietly lifted in November 2014, after the city collected a $16.5 million fee. </p>

<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/nyregion/builder-acquires-valuable-harlem-plot-after-deed-change.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;smtyp=cur">the NY Times reports</a> that at the same time the 45 Rivington deal was coming together, a similar negotiation was underway in Harlem: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/home/home.shtml">Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS)</a> accepted $875,000 to lift a 70s-era restriction on a corner lot at St. Nicholas Avenue and 152nd Street owned by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://www.dancetheatreofharlem.org/">Dance Theater of Harlem</a>. </p>

<p>That lot, previously preserved for nonprofit cultural organizations, eventually sold to a developer for $3.1 million last May.</p>

<p>A source close to the Harlem negotiation told the Times that the city has been in talks with purchaser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://www.brpcompanies.com/">BRP Companies</a> about constructing two dozen below-market rate apartments on the site, although no permits have been filed. </p>

<p>45 Rivington&apos;s owners initially approached local Community Board 3 about altering that deed restriction, putting the community on high alert. The Harlem deed change was stealthier&#x2014;neither the community board, nor local Council Member Mark Levine, nor Borough President Gale Brewer were informed. </p>

<p>&quot;We found out after it was lifted by just looking up the deed,&quot; a community board member told the paper. </p>

<p>The Rivington and St. Nicholas negotiations have significant parallels. Lobbyist James Capalino, who works for 45 Rivington purchaser Slate Group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-lobbyist-helped-turn-nursing-home-condos-article-1.2578230?cid=bitly">has bundled $50,000 in donations</a> to Mayor de Blasio (a spokeswoman for Capalino has since stated that he did not represent Slate Group in the deal); BRP Companies in 2014 contributed $10,000 to the Putnam County Democratic Committee&#x2014;coinciding with the Mayor&apos;s push to support Democratic Senate candidates through New York county committees. The Mayor&apos;s campaign donation habits are currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/09/de_blasio_fund-raising_corruption.php">under federal scrutiny</a>. </p>

<p>In response to questions about the Harlem deed restriction lift, DCAS stated, &#x201C;The city is in the process of reviewing its policy on the lifting of deed restrictions.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Dance Theater of Harlem issued a statement Friday. </p>

<p>The Rivington deal is currently being investigated by the Department of Investigation, Comptroller Scott Stringer&apos;s office and the State Attorney General&apos;s office. The City Council is also planning to hold a hearing on the process for lifting deed restrictions in a few weeks, and DCAS was questioned during a Finance Committee hearing on Friday. </p>

<p>Despite the investigations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/05/8599098/louis-ck-defends-goofball-mayor?top-featured-2">Capalino attended at fundraiser for de Blasio last night at Brooklyn Bowl</a>.</p>

<p>In March, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065646/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/nyregion/nursing-homes-sale-to-condo-developer-raises-questions-for-city.html?_r=1">the NY Times reported</a> that at least nine deed restrictions had been modified or lifted since de Blasio took office, primarily on vacant lots. In three deed negotiations since 2014, the city didn&apos;t accept any money. </p>

<p>DCAS Commissioner Lisette Camilo said on Friday that the agency has &quot;about 13 or 14&quot; deed restriction modification negotiations on hold, and that about four deed restrictions are lifted per year.</p>

<p>She declined to comment on the process by which DCAS determines the monetary value of a deed restriction lift or alteration: </p>

<blockquote>All of the process is being reviewed. Everything used to be done on a case-by-case analysis. I can&apos;t speak to what factors weigh in. There was a process that has been established for many years, and&#x2026; I can&apos;t speak to what factors contributed.</blockquote> 

<p>She added, &quot;In the case of Rivington, no one is happy with that outcome and we are looking at how we can do things better.&quot;</p>

<p>DCAS also promised the City Council today that it would hand over a list of all of the deed restrictions it&apos;s lifted in the last five years with associated payments.</p>

<p>Legislation proposed last month by councilmembers representing the Lower East Side would mandate radical transparency in all deed negotiations that could change a city-imposed restriction on a building&apos;s use. It would require public notice well before the city considers lifting a deed restriction, and mandate a new online database including property records for all NYC buildings that are subject to the City&apos;s deed restrictions.</p>

<p>Until recently, announcements of deed restriction negotiations were only listed in the City Record. In the case of 45 Rivington and St. Nicholas, the NY Times reports, public notice of a hearing on the deed changes was listed in the Record for one day. </p>

<p>According to the Mayor&apos;s office, DCAS mandated on March 1 that going forward, notice will be made &quot;not only in the City Record but to the affected Borough President, Council Member, and Community Board.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, it needs to be the law,&quot; Manhattan Borough President Brewer challenged last month. &quot;We need to do more. I can&apos;t tell you how many properties there are in this City with deed restrictions, or where those buildings are. Transparency is needed.&quot;</p>
