<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/https://www.wework.com/">WeWork</a>, the international co-working startup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://www.wsj.com/articles/valuation-of-shared-office-provider-wework-soars-to-10-billion-1435181485">recently valued</a> at $10 billion, is hoping to cash in on the concept of pre-packaged &quot;community&quot;&#x2014;with deluxe amenities, networking, and natural light&#x2014;for a certain subset of financially-secure young people who aspire to live by the moniker &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/01/in-the-name-of-love/">do what you love</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>For rents from $750/month for an office, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/https://www.wework.com/locations/new-york-city/wall-street">WeWork Wall Street</a> already lures freelancers, startups, and small companies in NYC with the promise of gym discounts, healthcare, purified water, and, according to its website, &quot;the awesome power of community.&quot; </p>

<p>Today, a spokeswoman for the startup confirmed that about 80 WeWork members and company employees have taken work-fun-life a.k.a. workfunlife to a new level, moving into 45 furnished &quot;coliving&quot; apartments at 110 Wall Street, which already rents seven floors of WeWork office space. </p>

<p>The startup would not confirm the rent for these apartments, but since some NYC millennials seem to appreciate a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/02/disrupt.php">$4,000/month &quot;dorm like atmosphere&quot;</a>, we can&apos;t image it comes cheap. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://www.fastcompany.com/3055325/from-wework-to-welive-company-moves-members-into-its-first-residential-building?utm_content=buffer4946e&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">FastCompany reports</a> that WeWork living&#x2014;the setup has tentatively been named &quot;WeLive&quot;&#x2014;promises the absolute minimum of roadblocks to life spent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/04/if_by_works_you_mean_go_to_hell.php">disrupting</a> full-time your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://gothamist.com/tags/uber">industry</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://gothamist.com/tags/airbnb">choice</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Along with living accommodations, residents will have access to community events like fitness classes and potluck dinners, services like cleaning and laundry, and a digital social network&#x2014;all of which can be coordinated through a mobile app....

<p>A monthly cleaning is included with rent (members will receive monthly bills for cable, utilities, Internet, and more frequent cleaning). Every floor has a common area such as a yoga studio or a movie theater. And the building has a community manager who will help plan Sunday night suppers, game nights, karaoke, and fitness classes.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>&quot;We are in the early stages of beta testing a new, community-driven living concept in New York City,&quot; said WeWork in a statement. &quot;This concept is another layer of our platform focused on enabling people to live more fulfilling lives. During this testing phase, we&apos;ll be listening to feedback from our community.&quot; </p>

<p>WeLive Wall Street will eventually accommodate 600 people on 20 floors, according to FastCompany. An internal document <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/https://www.theinformation.com/weworks-gamble-on-growth">leaked</a> over the summer suggests that this month&apos;s pilot is the first step in a much larger coliving plan, accessible to as many as 34,000 WeWork members and generating $605.9 million (about 20% of the startup&apos;s total revenue) by 2018. Something similar to 110 Wall Street is apparently in the works <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2014/05/SPR_CCP-6-Handout_May1214.pdf">outside Washington D.C</a>. </p>

<p>WeWork <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/02/janitors_at_wework_office_spaces.php">was hammered with bad press last year</a> when about 150 of its non-union office cleaners protested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101101715/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/05/wework_janitors.php">making as little as $10/hr</a> and were subsequently fired. The startup has since established a living wage of $18/hr for its cleaners, hired some of the old workers back, and pledged to work with union subcontractors. </p>

<p>We have reached out to service workers union SEIU 32BJ for any intel on staffing for WeLive, and will update accordingly. WeWork declined further comment. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  32BJ Vice President Shirley Aldebol stated on Monday, &quot;We expect to be talking with WeWork about the situation at WeLive.&quot; </p>
