<p>Subway riders waiting for the L train this post-holiday morning noticed new LCD countdown clocks hanging from station ceilings, in a white-on-blue color scheme that some said is difficult to read, especially compared to the yellow-on-black 1990s-era LED screens they&apos;ve replaced.</p>

<p>&quot;Great example of public design&apos;s irritating over-reliance on screens,&quot; rider Henry Garber <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624162006/https://twitter.com/HenryGrabar/status/869570251880628225">wrote on Twitter</a>.  &quot;In this case, LEDs were cleaner and clearer.&quot; </p>

<p>The new LCD screens are part of a program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624162006/http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/governor-cuomo-announces-testing-begins-new-countdown-clocks-and">announced last summer</a> to add countdown clocks to all of the lettered train lines in the system, according to an MTA spokesman. The MTA piloted LCD screens on the N, Q and R lines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624162006/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/04/fancy_counting_gadgets_whoa.php">starting last August</a>. One rider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624162006/https://twitter.com/_blahblahblah/status/869629833239769090">noted</a> Tuesday that the L line got a countdown clock upgrade while the other lettered lines are still waiting for their first clocks. </p>

<p>&quot;As for the old clocks on the L line, they were installed in the mid 90s, so they need to be replaced,&quot; said MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz on Tuesday. &quot;They&apos;re being installed at other locations as well as part of bringing train arrival info to the lettered lines.&quot; </p>

<p>Ortiz did not comment on the new color scheme, and whether it will be applied to all lines. </p>

<p>Not everyone took issue. &quot;What I like about the [new] signs on the subway are that they&apos;re subtle,&quot; said Steven Heller, co-chair of the MFA design program at the School of Visual Arts. &quot;It doesn&apos;t seem to be a perceptive or cognitive problem.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What strikes me as an odd choice is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624162006/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/ferrari_bus_identical.php">colors of the new MTA buses</a>,&quot; he added. &quot;Because they are so bold and obtrusive.&quot; </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624162006/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/25/mta_debt_expansion.php">recent amendment to the MTA&apos;s 2015-2019 Capital Plan</a> includes $38 million towards signaling upgrades and countdown clocks on the remaining lettered lines: the A, C, E; the B, D, F; the G; and the J, M, Z. A promise of system-wide countdown clocks made in 2009 has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624162006/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/09/the_countdown_to_countdown_clocks.php">kicked down the road</a> for years. Today, MTA spokeswoman Beth DeFalco declined to comment on the current installation timeline. &quot;[We] will have more to announce on that soon,&quot; she said. </p>
