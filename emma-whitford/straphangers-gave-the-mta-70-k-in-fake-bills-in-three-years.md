<p>MTA riders have passed off more than 3,300 fake bills&#x2014;or the equivalent of about $70,000&#x2014;at subway stations over the course of the last three years, handing the fake tender over to station agents or feeding it into MetroCard machines, agency data shows. </p>

<p>According to MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg, about $3 billion total is handled at subway stations on an annual basis. The fake money amounts to about .002% of that. </p>

<p>Indeed, $70,000 is a drop in the bucket for an agency that tends to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032712/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/24/mta_money_cuomo.php">talk in the billions</a>. But it&apos;s enough to have consequences for city employees&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427032712/http://www.amny.com/transit/subway-riders-give-mta-almost-70-000-in-counterfeit-money-over-past-3-years-transit-data-1.11216175">AM New York reports</a> that station agents who accept fake bills are in some cases required to make up the difference out of their own paychecks. </p>

<p>Station agents are equipped with special pens to detect fake bills, and a list of serial numbers to check bills against for legitimacy. Granted, as Transport Workers Union Local 100 Paul Flores put it to AM NY, &quot;Who is going to check the list in Times Square?&quot; </p>

<p>A machine called the the Fraud Fighter CT-550, which sucks bills in, tests them, and spits them out, is currently being piloted at just two stations. </p>

<p>The MTA got $23,279 in fake money in 2014, and $24,154 in 2013. This year to date, the agency has collected at least $22,559 worth of MetroCards using 972 fake bills. </p>

<p>The agency could not immediately confirm how much money is docked from station agents&apos; paychecks on a yearly basis. </p>
