<p>MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast told reporters on Wednesday that unless the State budget is finalized with concrete funding for the MTA&apos;s 2015-2019 capital plan, his authority will run out of money for new capital projects by June 30th. </p>

<p>&quot;June 30th of this year&#x2014;that&apos;s when we run out of money,&quot; Prendergast told reporters after an MTA board meeting Wednesday afternoon. To clarify, the dusty coffers would stall new MTA projects outlined in the 2015-19 capital plan. Projects that have already been approved, but have yet to break ground, would still be able to move forward.</p>

<p>For the last year or so, the MTA has managed to award new capital projects in the 2015-19 plan using cash funds&#x2014;some federal money and smaller revenue streams independent of City and State funding, plus dribbles diverted from ongoing MTA projects. </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA is basically juggling pots of money and moving things around so that they can keep operating as close to normal as possible,&quot; said William Henderson, director of the watchdog group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://www.pcac.org/">Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA</a>, on Wednesday. &quot;The problem is they are getting to the end of that. When you get to that point you make sure that the safety-critical work gets done, whether or not anything else gets done.&quot; </p>

<p>Reiterating the importance of the capital plan last summer, then-MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/09/city_review_finds_that_mta_is_slowi.php">forecasted</a> the consequences of running down the reserves. The MTA will be &quot;forced to make difficult choices,&quot; he said, between new subway cars and buses, replacing tracks, rebuilding switches, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/28/subway_mta_second_ave.php">extending the Second Avenue Subway</a> into East Harlem. </p>

<p>Prendergast emphasized on Wednesday that &quot;we have prioritized the awarding of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/east_side_access_photos.php#photo-1">East Side Access</a> project contract so as not to hold that up.... Certainly issues of safety that need to be dealt with, will be dealt with.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s like losing your job and knowing you have to pay rent for so many more months, and so you think, &apos;I can get through until about June without running out of money,&apos;&quot; Henderson  analogized. &quot;By the end of June I have to have a job.&quot; </p>

<p>The State and City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/at_last_cuomo_and_de_blasio_have_ag.php">agreed to fund</a> the MTA&apos;s 2015-19 capital plan in October, and Prendergast, a Cuomo appointee, has insisted for months that he is confident the Governor will keep his word. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/report_cuomos_budget_punts_on_mta_c.php">advocates</a>, State legislators and independent analysts have recently expressed concern that Cuomo&apos;s drafted budget proposal includes a vague promise of funding, rather than actual dollars. According to the proposal, funding will only become available once the MTA has drained all of its capital resources from years past. </p>

<p>As of last June, the MTA still had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/09/city_review_finds_that_mta_is_slowi.php">about $10 billion to spend down</a> from the 2010-14 plan. Alan Treffeisen, MTA analyst for the Independent Budget Office, said this week that it would likely take years for the MTA to use up what&apos;s left. </p>

<p>The City&apos;s $1.8 billion contribution to the MTA, which the Mayor&apos;s office confirmed will only be released with the State&apos;s $7.3 billion, is also stuck in the wings. </p>

<p>&quot;The MTA, before it can take any money from the State, has to exhaust all of its available sources,&quot; said Gene Russianoff of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://www.ridersny.org/">Riders Alliance</a> during his testimony before the board on Wednesday. &quot;And that&apos;s a tough thing to do. It&apos;s like one of those fairy tales&#x2014;I&apos;ll give you the money, but first go pick up some clover, and blonde hair, and a magical potion.&quot; </p>

<p>Yet Prendergast told reporters on Wednesday that he is still confident that the budget will be approved on schedule, by April 1st. &quot;This particular governor and this legislature has had on-time budgets,&quot; he said. &quot;So we&apos;ll know something by April 1st, and that&apos;s like 12 days away.&quot; </p>

<p>Reached for comment, State budget spokesman Peter Morris reiterated that the State&apos;s commitment to fund the capital plan is &quot;ironclad,&quot; adding, &quot;We&apos;re continuing to make progress towards a 6th consecutive on-time budget.&quot; </p>

<p>But that budget&apos;s fate still rests in the hands of the State legislature, where Senators recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040648/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/state_on_cuomos_26_billion_mta_plan.php">expressed bafflement</a> at Cuomo&apos;s drafted language. &quot;I really can&apos;t remember any program that we closed down on that we didn&apos;t know&#x2014;to the extent of that amount of money&#x2014;where it was coming from,&quot; Brooklyn Senator Marty Golden told Prendergast in February. This the longest the MTA has ever gone without a funded capital plan&#x2014;the MTA first signed off on it in September 2014. </p>

<p>Many advocates place blame squarely on Cuomo. &quot;It&apos;s his agency, he appoints the leadership, and he gains all sorts of benefits, right?&quot; Russianoff told us. &quot;Cuomo can be there when there&apos;s a subway series and when they reopen the R train after 14 months, and that means he has to be there when the agency is in need and its ridership is in need,&quot; he said. &quot;And that&apos;s where we are now.&quot; </p>

<p>The MTA press office did not respond to our questions about the urgency of funding for the MTA 2015-2019 capital plan. </p>
