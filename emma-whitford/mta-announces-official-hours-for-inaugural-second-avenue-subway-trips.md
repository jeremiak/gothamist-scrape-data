					<p>Hours after the New York Times published a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181306/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/nyregion/second-avenue-subway-party-new-years-eve.html">tantalizing preview</a> of Governor Cuomo&apos;s New Years Eve Second Avenue Subway Celebration That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181306/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/26/post_189.php#photo-1">None Of Us Are Invited To</a>, the MTA has released instructions for plebeians hoping to ride the rails on New Year&apos;s Day. </p>

<p>Will you have &quot;a choice of over 20 different locally made libations, including beer from Rochester, whiskey from the Finger Lakes, gin from Buffalo and hard cider from the Hamptons&quot;? A live jazz band serenade at 72nd street? Nope, that&apos;s the other party. </p>

<p>Nonetheless! The new stations at 72nd Street, 86th Street and 96th Street will open at 11:45 a.m. on January 1st, fifteen minutes ahead of inaugural noon Q train trips, departing from 63rd, 72nd, 86th and 96th. </p>

<p>From January 2nd through January 8th, service will be partial: starting at 6 a.m. and running until 10 p.m. Twenty four-hour service will launch on January 9th. </p>

<p>&quot;New Year&apos;s Day marks a great New York moment and a significant milestone with the debut of the Second Avenue Subway,&quot; Governor Cuomo said in a statement. &quot;What was once thought to be the impossible, the on-time completion of this transformative project will increase the capacity of the nation&#x2019;s busiest subway system and positively impact the lives of millions of New Yorkers now and for years to come.&quot;</p>

<p>The release doesn&apos;t mention the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181306/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/21/2nd_avenue_subway_history.php">near-century</a> of fits and starts that predate Sunday&apos;s debut, nor the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181306/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/29/2nd_ave_subway_explainer.php?gallery0Pic=4#photo-4">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in budget overruns, nor the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181306/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/21/money_in_money_out.php">lack of solid funding</a> for the next three phases of the project. We&apos;ll suspend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181306/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/25/2nd_ave_subway_sads.php">griping</a> just long enough for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181306/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/23/second_ave_subway_96.php#photo-1">photo op</a>. </p>

<p>The MTA did not immediately respond to our inquiry about how much Cuomo&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve celebration will cost, but we&apos;ll update if we hear back. In addition to Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray, the party will draw guests from construction unions and arts organizations. The Governor&apos;s Office says a few lucky neighbors and business owners have invitations, too.</p>
