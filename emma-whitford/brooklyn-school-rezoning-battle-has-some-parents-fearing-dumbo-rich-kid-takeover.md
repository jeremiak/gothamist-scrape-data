										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="100115_Farragut.JPG" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224149im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/100115_Farragut.JPG" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i>Last month, Farragut community members cheered for Reverend Taylor, who is in favor of pushing back the rezoning decision for two years (Emma Whitford/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The Department of Education is standing by a rezoning proposal that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224149/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/22/dumbo_school_rezoning_fight.php">would require</a> predominantly white, upper-middle-class, bursting-at-the-seams PS 8 to move DUMBO students to PS 307&#x2014;a school that is currently under capacity, and predominantly serves African-American residents of the NYCHA-run Farragut Houses in Vinegar Hill. </p>

<p>However, in an effort to appease concerns that redrawing the lines would leave the tight-knit Farragut Houses community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224149/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/schools_brooklyn_race_class.php">outnumbered</a> inside its own school&#x2014;and turn low-income students into the minority in their own community&#x2014;the DOE has proposed giving admission priority for half of the seats in each class to students receiving free or reduced lunch. </p>

<p>There&apos;s a further stipulation to the plan, though&#x2014;students living within the newly redrawn PS 307 zone would have priority over those living outside of the zone, including outside students who qualify for free lunch. As a magnet school, PS 307 currently attracts some students from neighboring Fort Greene, Bed-Stuy and Downtown Brooklyn. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224149/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/38/48/dtg-307-rezoning-presentation-2015-11-27-bk.html?utm_source=20151124&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=storylink&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter">According to the Brooklyn Paper</a>, 85% of those students are low-income. </p>

<p>PS 307 PTA President Faraji Hannah-Jones fears that the DOE&apos;s proposal would not adequately protect the school&apos;s long-standing community, since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224149/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/realestate/transforming-a-brooklyn-neighborhood-with-new-condos.html?_r=0http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/realestate/transforming-a-brooklyn-neighborhood-with-new-condos.html?_r=0">high-rise development in DUMBO</a> continues to spike the population of well-off families within the proposed PS 307 zone. </p>

<p>According to Office of District Planning data, 162 kindergarteners live in the PS 8 zone, compared to just 17 in PS 307&apos;s zone. Based on the department&apos;s projections, the new zoning would balance the numbers: 102 at PS8 and 77 at PS 307. If a bulk of those students come from DUMBO, the rezoning could change PS 307&apos;s demographics considerably. </p>

<p>&quot;When we said 50 percent, we didn&apos;t say 50 percent with conditions,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224149/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/24/nyregion/admissions-quota-proposed-in-brooklyn-school-rezoning.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">Hannah-Jones said</a> at a Community Education Council Meeting on Monday. &quot;We said 50 percent, period.... We don&apos;t want PS 307 to become PS 8.&quot; </p>

<p>The Council now has 45 days to vote on the DOE rezoning proposal, which PS 8&apos;s PTA has already endorsed. If they reject it, PS 307 and PS 8&apos;s zones will remain unchanged for now. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the DOE confirmed that even if the rezoning goes into effect for the 2016-17 school year, a quota system would not be instated until 2017. </p>

<p>&quot;The DOE is committed to working with the CEC and District 13 community to ensure that the rezoning process is inclusive of all partners,&quot; the DOE said in a statement. &quot;We&#x2019;re encouraged by the progress and collaboration taking place, and we&#x2019;ll continue to engage both school communities, families, community members and elected officials with meaningful conversations during the duration of this process.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this fall, we spoke with a current PS 307 teacher on condition of anonymity, since PS 307&apos;s principal has asked faculty to decline interview requests for the duration of the rezoning debate. </p>

<p>A teacher in the community for 18 years, she&apos;s been involved in the PTA since the 1970s, when her five children were young. She&apos;s lived in the Farragut Houses for decades, and said that watching DUMBO grow, she&apos;s felt a sense of unease and unwelcome in her own neighborhood. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re now the undesirables, but we were here before,&quot; she said, referencing the arrival of bike lanes and the expansion of the Brooklyn Bridge Park, even as her sons have experience an uptick in police harassment. &quot;It&apos;s almost like we came into <em>their</em> space.&quot; </p>

<p>Last week, the DOE dropped an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307224149/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/city_drops_rezoning_plan_that_would.php">equally-controvoersial rezoning plan</a> on the Upper West Side, tabling the issue of overcrowding at elite PS 199 until further notice. </p>
