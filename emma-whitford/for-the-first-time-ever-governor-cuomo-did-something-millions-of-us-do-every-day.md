<p>Remember back in March, when Governor Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111748/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/ferrari_bus_identical.php">got giggly</a> comparing the MTA&apos;s design for a new Wi-Fi-equipped city bus augmented with charging ports and LCD information screens to a Ferrari? </p>

<p>&quot;These are not gonna be your father&apos;s buses,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Eying the rendering of a royal-blue articulated bus with a gold wave-like swoosh detail and prominent Wi-Fi logo, he added, &quot;It has a European flair to it. I think it has almost a Ferrari-like look. Aerodynamic. Well done.&quot; </p>

<p>Today, a few of those buses hit the road, and reporters learned that Cuomo has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111748/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/25/cuomo_bus_ted.php"><strike>taken</strike></a> posed on a bus, exactly once, for a photo op. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first seven new buses will start running today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111748/https://t.co/ThxUPOwnjv">pic.twitter.com/ThxUPOwnjv</a></p>&#x2014; NYCT Subway (@NYCTSubway) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111748/https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/732619391238602752">May 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Seven buses are expected to go into service today, and an additional handful will join them every day for the next few weeks. The MTA says 75 buses will be in operation in time for the summer, in the Queens neighborhoods of Richmond Hill, South Jamaica, South Ozone Park, Springfield Gardens, Rosedale and Far Rockaway. </p>

<p>Over the next two years, we can expect 70 new buses in Brooklyn, 209 in the Bronx, and 18 in Manhattan. The remaining 1,670 will hit the road by 2020, across all five boroughs, replacing 40% of the existing fleet. </p>

<p>Also today, Cuomo announced a successful pilot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111748/https://www.etix.com/ticket/online/">eTix</a>, an app New York is testing out for purchasing LIRR and Metro-North tickets &quot;anytime, anywhere.&quot; The state says the app will be available system-wide by the end of the year, and will eventually synch with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111748/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/farewell_metrocard_mta_plans_to_kil.php">whatever kills the MetroCard</a>.
