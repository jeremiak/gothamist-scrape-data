<p>New York City neighborhoods where the most common language spoken at home isn&apos;t English stand out on web developer and designer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502032424/https://twitter.com/jill_hubley">Jill Hubley&apos;s</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502032424/http://www.jillhubley.com/project/nyclanguages/#close">latest census map</a> like islands: deep blue Spanish in Sunset Park; mint green Yiddish in Hasidic Williamsburg and a portion of Crown Heights; fuchsia Russian in Brighton Beach. </p>

<p>Hubley, who also brought us maps of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502032424/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/15/tree_map_nyc.php">tree species</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502032424/http://www.citylab.com/work/2015/03/a-grimly-fascinating-map-of-toxic-spills-in-brooklyn/388946/">toxic spills</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502032424/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/climate_change_map_nyc.php">greenhouse gas emissions by building</a>, designed the Languages of NYC map to complement her analog map of Queens languages, which was on display at the Queens Museum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502032424/http://www.queensmuseum.org/events/map-mosaic-from-queens-to-the-world">this past weekend</a>. </p>

<p>The web version uses the United State Census Bureau&apos;s American Community Survey, hence the somewhat random application of specificity (we get Thai, Urdu and Laotian, then &quot;Other Asian Languages&quot; and &quot;Other Pacific Island Languages&quot; and the maddeningly broad &quot;African Languages&quot;). </p>

<p>According to the federal government, the 2014 data on languages spoken at home is used to determine how to print voting materials and public health notices by census tract. </p>

<p>&quot;The data collection needs to be looked at a little more,&quot; Hubley cautioned on Monday afternoon. &quot;If you look at Rikers Island it&apos;s French Creole and if you look at Central Park it&apos;s Vietnamese.&quot;  </p>

<p>Still, it&apos;s fun to select for one specific language and see where it crops up. &quot;There&apos;s more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502032424/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language">Tagalog</a> than I expected,&quot; Hubley added. </p>

<p>While the map&apos;s &quot;All Languages&quot; tab is its most accurate display of New York&apos;s distinct cultural enclaves, we also suggest filtering the map for &quot;Exclude English&quot; and &quot;Exclude English and Spanish&quot;&#x2014;cut the city&apos;s most predominant languages out of the picture, and you get a kaleidoscope of runners-up. </p>

<p>Take Staten Island: English dominates with the exception of a few tiny pockets on the north shore. But cut English out, and the map reveals Russian-speaking households on the eastern waterfront, Spanish to the north, and Italian and Chinese in the center. </p>
