<p>New City Council legislation that would require landlords to sign a &quot;certificate of no harassment&quot; before renovating or demolishing a building&#x2014;effectively barring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/25/worst_landlords_nyc_2015.php">notorious landlords</a> from pressuring tenants to vacate&#x2014;was met with considerable pushback Monday from city housing officials who described the proposed law as &quot;overly broad, poorly targeted, and considerably costly.&quot;</p>

<p>As the Council approaches its final vote on Mayor de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/de_blasio_zoning_affordable.php">controversial affordable housing plan</a>&#x2014;one that could rezone some of the city&apos;s poorest neighborhoods to allow for taller residential buildings with a percentage of affordable apartments&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1681072&amp;GUID=7D25EC9E-252A-437E-A169-5736A26BD901&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">bill discussed today</a> aims to protect tenants in the city&apos;s hundreds of thousands of rent regulated apartments. These tenants are often subject to harassment tactics&#x2014;such as dangerous construction in neighboring apartments&#x2014;as new market-rate apartments pop up in their neighborhoods, bringing wealthier New Yorkers to the neighborhood and driving up property values. </p>

<p>Brothers Joel and Aaron Israel of JBI Management <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/17/brooklyn_slumlords_arrest.php#photo-9">made headlines</a> in 2014 for such tactics&#x2014;blasting a crater-sized hole in the middle of one family&apos;s Bushwick apartment at 98 Linden Street, for example, and taking an axe to the boilers at 300 Nassau Street. The Israels were arrested last April, but many of their tenants endured barely-livable conditions for over a year.</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio&apos;s affordable housing plan calls for the preservation of 120,000 currently-affordable apartments. However, in extending longstanding rent laws last June&#x2014;with a few minor adjustments&#x2014;the state <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/cuomo_rent_albany_samo.php">maintained loopholes</a> that motivate landlords to vacate low-income tenants. For example, under rent stabilization, vacancy allowance lets landlords increase the rent in rent-controlled apartments between tenants. A stipulation called vacancy decontrol insures that a rent stabilized apartment is no longer protected once the rent reaches $2,700. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/https://www.facebook.com/alliancefortenantpower">Alliance for Tenant Power</a> has estimated that the city will lose as many as 100,000 rent-regulated apartments in the next four years as a result. </p>

<p>&quot;This law would flip the existing incentive structure, so that harassment is discouraged instead of rewarded,&quot; testified Emily Goldstein of the advocacy group Tenants and Neighbors. </p>

<p>&quot;Harassment is an unwritten part of the business plan in neighborhoods like Bushwick,&quot; echoed Ezra Kautz, a supervising housing attorney for Make the Road NY. </p>

<p>According to the city, tenant evictions decreased 5.5% in 2015. However, about 22,000 tenants still lost their homes to evictions last year. While HPD administrators testified repeatedly on Monday that it is interested in &quot;having a conversation&quot; with the City Council about reducing this number, the administration deemed the no-harassment certificate legislation unfeasible. </p>

<p>Vito Mustaciuolo, deputy commissioner for HPD&apos;s Office of Enforcement and Neighborhood Services, testified that the bill would slow construction and development across the city, in the name of punishing a &quot;small percentage of bad actors.&quot; Mustaciuolo argued for &quot;a much more surgical approach,&quot; such as prioritizing landlords with properties in at-risk neighborhoods like East New York and East Harlem.</p>

<p>&quot;The emphasis should be on preventing harassment and the tools should not impose costly delays on development and rehab,&quot; Mustaciuolo said. &quot;The bill would cause administrative delays impacting construction of apartments all over the city... some areas of the city have [many] unregulated buildings, where the landlord doesn&apos;t need to harass tenants, because it isn&apos;t illegal to raise the rent.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;We know that under the current system a lot of buildings are slipping through,&quot; Mustaciuolo added, after more than an hour of fielding questions from the council. &quot;A lot of landlords are getting away with it.&quot; </p>

<p>HPD also argued that the de Blasio administration has invested considerably in tenant protection services&#x2014;last September, the Mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/653-15/de-blasio-administration-help-prevent-homelessness-adding-resources-keep-new-yorkers-in">announced $46.3 million</a> in anti-eviction legal services in the 2016 budget. According to the city, this funding can serve 32,000 apartments. The city also formed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/18/daniel_melamed_crown_heights.php">Tenant Harassment Prevention Taskforce</a> last summer to target the city&apos;s worst-offending landlords. </p>

<p>Councilmembers on Monday also made repeated reference to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201025451/https://www.propublica.org/article/landlords-fail-to-list-fifty-thousand-nyc-apartments-for-rent-limits">November ProPublica investigation</a> which found that at least 50,000 apartments city-wide are not officially registered as rent-regulated, even as their landlords reap the benefit of government subsidies. One current HPD employee, whose responsibilities include counting units registered for stabilization, put the number closer to 200,000 apartments. </p>

<p>&quot;HPD knows it doesn&apos;t have the resources to deal with these issues,&quot; testified Urban Justice Center attorney Harvey Epstein. &quot;They say we don&apos;t need legislation to deal with this, but unless we have legislation, we&apos;re never going to have structures in place to deal with unaffordability in this city.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> An earlier version of this article incorrectly defined vacancy allowance and vacancy decontrol. </p>
