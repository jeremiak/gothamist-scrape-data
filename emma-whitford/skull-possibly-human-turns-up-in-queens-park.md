<p>A Parks Department employee was patrolling a park in Jamaica, Queens on Thursday afternoon when he came across what appeared to be a human skull and jumble of bones inside of a trash bag. </p>

<p>The skull, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404060949/http://nypost.com/2016/02/11/human-remains-found-in-queens-park/">captured peeking out of its garbage bag</a> by the Post, looks like a window display item for a Halloween superstore. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404060949/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/11/police-skull-possible-human-remains-found-in-queens-park/">CBS reports</a> the remains in question were bagged up in a flower bed. </p>

<p>The NYPD confirmed that it responded to a call about the finding shortly after 2:00 p.m. on Thursday, at Peters Field Park at the corner of 183rd Place and Henderson Avenue. The Medical Examiner&apos;s Office is now conducting an evaluation to determine if they are actual human bones.  </p>
