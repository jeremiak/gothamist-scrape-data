										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="160909DorisLingCohan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/160909DorisLingCohan.jpg" width="640" height="431"> <br> <i>Judge Doris Ling-Cohan (CSPAN)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The Manhattan Democratic Party is reportedly planning to include tenant-friendly Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Doris Ling-Cohan on its reelection ballot at the Democratic county convention later this month, defying a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/09/doris_ling-cohan_judge_skullduggery.php">down-vote</a> from an independent panel tasked with deciding which judges should be considered for inclusion on the ticket come November. </p>

<p>The decision follows a vote in Ling-Cohan&apos;s favor from the party&apos;s executive committee, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://nypost.com/2016/09/12/jilted-judge-wins-re-election-ballot-battle-after-being-barred/">according to the New York Post</a>. The tabloid cited anonymous sources; the Manhattan Democrats could not immediately be reached for comment. </p>

<p>Party operatives control which judge candidates get listed on the party line, and, generally, who gets elected. And it&apos;s rare for the party panel&#x2014;made up primarily of local lawyers and activists&#x2014;to bar a sitting judge from the ballot. </p>

<p>The narrow 12-10 vote against Ling-Cohan surprised many tenant, LGBT, and Asian-American advocates last week, who accused real estate lawyers on the panel of targeting a judge with a history of making pro-tenant rulings. The NY Post first reported on the vote, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://nypost.com/2016/08/31/democratic-party-bars-lazy-pro-lgbt-judge-from-election-ticket/">citing anonymous sources</a> who described Ling-Cohan as &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;slow.&quot; More than 100 local Democrats and advocates rallied against these allegations last week, and retired Supreme Court judge Emily Jane Goodman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/supporters-rally-after-asian-american-justice-loses-democratic-endorsement-n643896">dismissed them in full</a>, saying that &quot;none of the things that are being written about her have I ever heard inside 60 Centre Street.&quot; </p>

<p>Assemblyman Keith Wright, head of the New York County Democrats, also spoke out against the panel&apos;s ruling, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/this-weeks-news/id=1202766993631/Lacking-Nod-from-Screening-Panel-Democratic-Leaders-Hint-at-Judges-ReNomination?mcode=1202615036097&amp;curindex=3&amp;slreturn=20160812120113">saying</a>, &quot;I fundamentally disagree with the panel&apos;s decision,&quot; and that Ling-Cohan &quot;is the author of ground-breaking decisions and a standard bearer for her community.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2002, Ling-Cohan became the first female Asian judge in New York Supreme Court history. Her legacy includes the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=50913X1248263&amp;site=gothamist.com&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2005%2F02%2F05%2Fnyregion%2Fjudges-ruling-opens-window-for-gay-marriage-in-new-york-city.html&amp;xguid=14733c6dea481944c590e16ed2613468&amp;xuuid=233e4d4f700514752ef0468fdebabf99&amp;xsessid=c82abab8824850b35a0800bdcc5ddc96&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2F2016%2F09%2F09%2Fdoris_ling-cohan_judge_skullduggery.php&amp;pref=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.yahoo.com%2F&amp;xtz=240">landmark 2005 decision</a> ordering New York City to issue marriage licenses to gay couples (which then-mayor Michael Bloomberg went on to successfully appeal). </p>

<p>The director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://www.aaldef.org/">Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://aaldef.org/press-releases/press-release/aaldef-statement-on-ny-supreme-court-justice-doris-ling-cohan.html">spoke out strongly in Ling-Cohan&apos;s favor</a> last week, cautioned on Monday that this reported decision does not guarantee the judge&apos;s reelection. Also, while it&apos;s good news for Ling-Cohan, it raises questions about the legitimacy of the independent panel, and the entire election process of judges in New York. </p>

<p>&quot;How did the panel reach a decision that wasn&apos;t based on the right standards?&quot; said Margaret Fung. &quot;Voters need to think about whether this is the way they want judges to be elected.&quot; </p>

<p>The New York Law Journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/this-weeks-news/id=1202766993631/Lacking-Nod-from-Screening-Panel-Democratic-Leaders-Hint-at-Judges-ReNomination?mcode=1202615036097&amp;curindex=3&amp;slreturn=20160812120113">reports</a> that Ling-Cohan will have to get majority approval from the 140-odd convention delegates in order to land on the ballot. </p>

<p>Delegates to the convention will be elected by registered Democrats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132448/http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-york-judicial-elections-smoke-filled-rooms-still-rule/">at the ballot box</a> during tomorrow&apos;s primary, unless of course there aren&apos;t enough delegate candidates to make a given district contested, in which case, whoever is nominated as a delegate automatically proceeds to the convention. Yes, we know, this makes no sense.</p>
