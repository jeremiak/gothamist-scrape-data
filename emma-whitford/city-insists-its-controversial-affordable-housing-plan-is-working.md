<p>Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen announced on Tuesday that the city&apos;s latest affordable housing numbers prove that Mayor de Blasio&apos;s controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/de_blasio_zoning_affordable.php">Housing New York Plan</a>&#x2014;which relies heavily on providing subsidies to private developers in exchange for a percentage of below-market rate units&#x2014;is ahead of schedule. </p>

<p>According to City Hall, the administration has created or preserved a combined 52,936 units of affordable housing since the plan&apos;s launch in 2014. The mayor&apos;s goal of 200,000 affordable units by the year 2024 only calls for 50,000 units at this stage. </p>

<p>&quot;Many people in the housing development and real estate fields in New York and nationally thought [this] was a fairly crazy and overly ambitious goal,&quot; Glen said on Tuesday. (Mayor de Blasio himself was absent, having traveled to Philadelphia for the Democratic Convention.) </p>

<p>Advocates have argued that these numbers represent too little too late. Before Mayor de Blasio&apos;s housing plan was implemented, the city was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/07/de_blasios_housing_plan.php">short 550,000 affordable apartments</a> for families that make less than $42,000 per year. For that income group, the plan calls for 16,000 new apartments, or less than 3% of the need. Meanwhile, NYC&apos;s population is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/02/buffalo_it_is.php">booming</a>. And thanks to loopholes in the existing rent laws, the Alliance for Tenant Power <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/cuomo_rent_albany_samo.php">estimates</a> that the city could lose 100,000 affordable units by 2019.</p>

<p>Over the fiscal year ending in June, the city says it created or preserved 23,284 affordable housing units&#x2014;up from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/13/affordable_housing_trickle.php">20,325 units in fiscal year 2015</a>, and the most affordable housing the city has generated since 1989. </p>

<p>The majority of the new or preserved units are in Manhattan&#x2014;16,935 of them, followed by 16,507 in Brooklyn. According to HPD, they&apos;re concentrated in neighborhoods including East Harlem, Brownsville in Brooklyn, and Highbridge and Belmont in the Bronx. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the breakdown, by affordability: </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="072716_AffordableHousing.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/072716_AffordableHousing.jpeg" width="640" height="202"> <br> <i> (via Mayor&apos;s office). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Preservation far outstripped ground-up construction last year, in large part thanks to the city&apos;s financing on two major preservation projects: Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, between East 14th and 23rd Streets, and the Riverton Houses in East Harlem. </p>

<p>The preservation process does not insure permanent affordability&#x2014;when a building is &quot;preserved,&quot; its owner receives a cocktail of loans and tax breaks that expire after between 15 and 30 years, taking any affordability requirements with them. </p>

<p>In the case of Stuy Town, the city helped finance a deal between the complex&apos;s then-owners and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://www.blackstone.com/">Blackstone Group</a>, a massive international investment firm that manages some $93 billion in properties. Ultimately, Blackstone agreed to preserve the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/20/stuyvesant_town_sold_yet_again_with.php">relatively affordable rents of 5,000 of the complex&apos;s regulated units</a>. In exchange, the investor was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/stuy_town_affordable_housing.php">guaranteed one million square feet of extremely valuable air rights</a>. </p>

<p>For city officials, Stuy Town is proof of the success of a housing plan that hinges on private investment. </p>

<p>&quot;Some people would have said, &apos;What are you doing? Why are you in the middle of private market transactions? That&apos;s not the role of the government.&apos;&quot; Glen said on Tuesday. &quot;We were very clear when we came into office that we were going to be strategic and [intervene] where we could.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Blackstone is a notorious private equity company that is going to... be making money hand over fist,&quot; argued Cea Weaver, research and policy director for New York Communities For Change, a coalition of housing advocates for low-income New Yorkers. &quot;The more we go down this path, the more we&apos;re empowering private investors to control a public resource.&quot; </p>

<p>Reporters pointed out this week that, less Stuy Town and Riverton, the city actually preserved fewer affordable units than it did last year. </p>

<p>Glen said that while there aren&apos;t projects the size of Stuy Town in the pipeline, the city will &quot;work harder&quot; in order to achieve similar numbers in the future. </p>

<p>&quot;I can&apos;t say that [it will be 17,000], but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not going to be [as low as] 11,000,&quot; she said. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="121715zoning1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/121715zoning1.jpg" width="640" height="423"> <br> <i> (Denn Ice / Flickr)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Vicki Been, head of the city&apos;s Housing and Preservation Development (HPD), emphasized today that 25% of the units produced to date, 12,970 of the total, are set aside for New Yorkers who make less than 50% of the Area Median Income, or $40,800 for a family of three. Of that total, 6,817 are set aside for extremely low income families, those that make less than $24,000 per year. </p>

<p>&quot;These are the very hardest units to produce,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>For context, a full third of the city&apos;s households have an annual income of less than $35,000. </p>

<p>The Mayor&apos;s team indicated Tuesday that it is doing the best it can under the circumstances. &quot;Land and construction costs [are high],&quot; Glen said. &quot;We don&apos;t have a gazillion city-owned buildings to put into the sausage maker. We have to be much more creative and work with the private sector.&quot; </p>

<p>At the moment, there are no plans to develop deeper city subsidies for the constriction of affordable housing. </p>

<p>&quot;The fact that developers continue to want to do business with us and are able to make their margins work given where the subsidies are, generally speaking we don&apos;t have to raise subsidy levels right now,&quot; Glen added.</p>

<p>Advocates have argued that the city could do a better job of documenting and assessing the vacant properties already in its control, which might be converted to deeply affordable housing at a lower cost. This spring, HPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/09/nyc_affordable_housing_vacancy.php">confirmed 897 vacant apartment units</a> in just one city-owned housing program. In 2012, the advocacy group Picture the Homeless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012125630/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/thousands-vacant-buildings-city-house-homeless-new-report-based-volunteer-count-claims-article-1.1011819">counted more than 3,500 vacant buildings</a> across the five boroughs. </p>

<p>Asked if the city had plans to count and assess all of its vacant properties, Been said it did not. </p>

<p>&quot;When my inspectors are on the ground they&apos;re always looking for signs of vacancy, and then... we reach out to the owner and try to understand what is going on,&quot; she said. &quot;The city does not have a registry of vacant property, but we monitor it very carefully.&quot; </p>
