										<p>An upstate rabbi was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Monday, for his involvement in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000705/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/bail_set_for_alleged_kidnapping_rab.php">longstanding</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000705/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/rabbis_kidnap_torture_divorce_jews.php">extortion ring</a> that facilitated the kidnapping and torture of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men unwilling to grant their wives a ritual divorce.</p>

<p>Rabbi Martin Wolmark, 57, pled guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion in January. Following today&apos;s sentencing, he&apos;ll also serve two years of post-release supervision and pay a $50,000 fine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000705/http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2015/12/rabbi_sentenced_to_38_months_in_jail_in_extortion-.html">according to the Advance</a>. </p>

<p>Allegations were first put forward in the fall of 2013 that Wolmark, along with Rabbi Mendel Epstein and a group of associates, facilitated the torture of husbands. The husband-victims were pressured to agree to a &quot;get,&quot; or ritual consent to divorce. </p>

<p>In the lead-up to these accusations, undercover FBI agents posed as divorce-desperate wives, recording multiple incriminating telephone conversations with Epstein and Wolmark. </p>

<p>During one conversation, Wolmark assured an undercover agent that Epstein could get her husband to agree to a get if he could be lured to New York from Argentina, where the agent said he was living. Epstein and associates would &quot;harass or nail&quot; the husband, Wolmark assured. The service, carried out by &quot;tough guys,&quot; would cost $30,000. </p>

<p>&quot;Basically what we are going to be doing is kidnapping a guy for a couple of hours and beating him up and torturing him and then getting him to give the get,&quot; Epstein, who was also well known in the Orthodox community as a divorce mediator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000705/http://nypost.com/2013/10/17/new-accusers-in-rabbi-torture-ring/">allegedly said</a> in another conversation with undercovers. &quot;We will take an electric cattle prod [and] put it in certain parts of his body and in one minute the guy will know.&quot;</p>

<p>FBI agents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000705/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/rabbis_charged_in_divorce_shakedown_to_be_released_on_bail.html#incart_m-rpt-1">ultimately accused</a> Wolmark and Epstein of orchestrating about 20 kidnappings. </p>

<p>Epstein is scheduled for sentencing this week. <br>
