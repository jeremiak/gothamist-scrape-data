<p>The seeing-is-believing adage doesn&apos;t <em>really</em> apply here&#x2014;we won&apos;t accept that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/photos_deep_inside_the_second_avenu.php">phase one of the Second Avenue Subway</a> is complete until we&apos;re swiping our MetroCards at 72nd Street&#x2014;but here&apos;s another reason the MTA is on the hook: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2016/05/23/w-train-revival-set-board-approval-2nd-ave-subway-operations-come-view/">latest version of the subway map</a> <em>includes those new stations</em>. Look, there&apos;s the Q train branching off just past Lexington Avenue!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="052616_Maps4.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/052616_Maps4.jpeg" width="640" height="871"> <br> <i> Feast your eyes (via MTA). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>And here&apos;s the downtown section of the W, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/w_train_return.php">should be back on the rails</a> by November, primarily to serve Astoria residents who are losing their Q service: </p>

<p>The MTA is so confident that phase one of the Second Avenue Subway will be complete by December, that they&apos;ve already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/21/money_in_money_out.php">earmarked some additional funds</a> for phase two. And while it&apos;s important to remember that there&apos;s a difference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/25/cuomo_finally_funded_the_mta_capita.php">between earmarked money and cold, hard cash</a>, for now we&apos;ll just give it up for maps&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/subway_lines_that_would_revolutioni.php">imaginary</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053622/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/subway_for_newbs.php">dummy</a>, and futuristic maps. <br>
