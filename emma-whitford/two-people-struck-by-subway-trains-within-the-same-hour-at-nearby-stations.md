<p>Two people fell onto the subway tracks at nearby stations on Thursday night and were struck by oncoming trains, according to the NYPD. One of the victims, a woman in her 30s, was rushed to the hospital for an emergency double leg amputation. Both victims survived, and there is no criminality suspected. </p>

<p>The 36-year-old female victim was on the southbound 3 train platform at 14th Street and Seventh Avenue around 10:20 p.m. when she fell onto the track bed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110607/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Woman-Faints-Falls-Subway-Tracks-3-Train-Hits-Her-West-Village-383375811.html">Witnesses told NBC</a> that she was standing near the platform&apos;s edge and fainted onto the tracks, although the NYPD could confirm only that she had not been pushed. Both of the woman&apos;s legs were severed by the oncoming train, and EMTs rushed her to Bellevue Hospital for surgery. She remains hospitalized in serious condition. </p>

<p>Earlier, around 9:30 p.m., a 24-year-old man fell onto the E train tracks at 14th Street and Eighth Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110607/http://nypost.com/2016/06/17/two-injured-in-separate-subway-incidents-on-same-block/">The NY Post reports</a> that he attempted to pull himself back onto the platform as a northbound E train approached, but wasn&apos;t quick enough. His legs were wedged between the platform and the train. He was also transported Bellevue Hospital, though his injuries were comparatively minor. </p>

<p>Also on Thursday, cops say a woman jumped onto the Metro-North tracks of her own volition, leaving her small child in a stroller on the platform. </p>

<p>Iris Ana Gonzalez, 37, allegedly got into a fight with her boyfriend on a Grand Central-bound train, and was pulled onto the 125th Street platform by transit cops. According to a spokeswoman for the NYPD, Gonzalez then jumped into the track bed. Officers pulled her from the tracks and took her to Bellevue for a psychological evaluation, uninjured. Gonzalez was not arrested, but her child has been taken into ACS custody. </p>

<p>&quot;She&apos;s not a crazy mom,&quot; a friend of Gonzalez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110607/http://nypost.com/2016/06/16/crazed-mom-ditches-child-jumps-onto-train-tracks/">told the Post</a>. &quot;I think she had a temporary mental breakdown and she didn&#x2019;t know how to handle it.&quot; </p>
