<p>A Brooklyn judge has ruled that an ex-JetBlue pilot, who recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134636/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/27/jetblue_pilot_arrested_for_flying_d.php">got in trouble</a> for allegedly flying a passenger plane drunk between Florida and JFK Airport in 2015, won&apos;t have to stop drinking altogether as part of his bail agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;He does like to have a glass of wine once in a while with his dinner,&quot; Dennis Thomas Murphy Jr.&apos;s defense lawyer Neal Comer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134636/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ex-jetblue-pilot-charged-drunk-flying-drink-judge-article-1.2640462?cid=bitly">said in court Tuesday</a>. &quot;He&apos;s not an alcoholic now.&quot;</p>

<p>Murphy&apos;s also reportedly been known to blame the results of an unfavorable Breathalyzer test on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134636/http://nypost.com/2016/04/27/jetblue-pilot-busted-for-flying-drunk-to-jfk/">the gum he was chewing</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160926134636/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jetblue-pilot-charged-drunken-flying-return-trip-jfk-article-1.2616158">According to the News</a>, Murphy was selected for a random alcohol test on April 21st last year, after flying 151 passengers from Orlando to JFK. He blew a .11 BAC, breaking the .10 threshold for pilots. Earlier in the day, Murphy had flown another 119 passengers from JFK to Orlando. </p>

<p>His co-pilot later told investigators he saw Murphy &#x201C;drinking an unknown beverage from a cup&#x201D; before and during the two flights. He&apos;s since been charged with flying under the influence, and posted $50,000 bond. </p>

<p>Murphy resigned after that debacle, and was stripped of the medical certification needed to fly a plane. The News reports that he&apos;s now working as a substitute teacher, and has the right to relax within reason&#x2014;an exception to the typical bail rules&#x2014;so long as he&apos;s willing to submit to regular Breathalyzer tests from the comfort of his home. He&apos;s also facing a maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>
