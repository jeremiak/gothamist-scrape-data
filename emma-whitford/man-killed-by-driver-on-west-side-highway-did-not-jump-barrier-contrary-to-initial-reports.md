Koval did not, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/31/man_struck_west_side_highway.php">as was originally reported</a>, jump a divider and step into oncoming traffic before he was killed. <p></p>

<p>While the investigation is ongoing, police confirmed Friday that the divider account has been dismissed. The official Police Accident Report, shared with Gothamist by Koval&apos;s family, makes no mention of a divider. Instead it states that Koval was crossing 12th Avenue in the crosswalk at 45th Street shortly after 2:15 a.m. on July 31st. The driver, according to the report, had the green light when he struck Koval. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the NYPD confirmed Friday that the Accident Report is based off of surveillance footage from the scene. She could not, however, determine where the divider account came from. </p>

<p>&quot;Apparently that was the wrong information,&quot; she said. &quot;Because for some reason, I&apos;m not sure exactly where that came from, but they [the traffic unit] don&apos;t have that [divider statement] on any of their paperwork.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This is what whoever provided information gave us, and we got the correct information after,&quot; she continued. &quot;We usually try to wait a little bit before we send this information out. I don&apos;t know what happened there.&quot; </p>

<p>The standard e-mail alert sent to local media outlets a few hours after Koval&apos;s death stated that, according to a &quot;preliminary investigation,&quot; the victim had &quot;climbed over a divider and stepped into oncoming traffic.&quot; The news was reported widely. &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://pix11.com/2016/07/31/pedestrian-fatally-struck-on-west-side-highway-after-climbing-over-divider/">Pedestrian fatally struck on West Side Highway after climbing over divider</a>,&quot; Pix11 wrote.</p>

<p>The Emory Wheel, the newspaper at Koval&apos;s Alma mater, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://emorywheel.com/2016-grad-jack-koval-dies-in-nyc-car-accident/">generated its own diagram of the crash</a>, based off of the preliminary information from the NYPD. In it, dashed arrows indicate Koval crossing over the median, outside of the crosswalk.  </p>

<p>Koval, who graduated from Emory University this spring, moved to New York City shortly after the Fourth of July to start a job as an analyst at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://www.centerviewpartners.com/">Centerview Partners</a>, a financial advisory firm. &quot;It was absolutely his dream job,&quot; his father, Joe Koval, told us from his home in Rochester, NY. &quot;I mean, he was just never happier.&quot; </p>

<p>Friends from school, including his Alpha Kappa Psi Fraternity, have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/https://www.facebook.com/jack.koval.35?fref=ts">loaded Koval&apos;s Facebook</a> with comments in the last week. &quot;Thank you for being an amazing friend, for explaining math theorems to me so I could (barely) pass our classes,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153834984222709&amp;set=p.10153834984222709&amp;type=3&amp;theater">wrote</a> his friend Sarah Choi. </p>

<p>Koval was killed a few blocks away from his 11th Avenue high-rise apartment. The NYPD&apos;s preliminary report provided minimal information about the 26-year-old driver, who remained on the scene: only that the vehicle was &quot;traveling northbound on 12th Avenue.&quot; Police provided additional information on Friday, stating that the driver crossed from the left-center lane to the right-center lane after crossing 45th Street, and struck Koval in the crosswalk at 46th Street. </p>

<p>Koval&apos;s father was upset by the early media reports, which he feared painted an inaccurate picture of his son. </p>

<p>&quot;He just would not cross a barrier,&quot; he told us. &quot;I mean, I&apos;ve been in parking lots with him where I climbed over a barrier and he would walk 50 yards to get around through the opening and come back.... He just wasn&apos;t in a hurry, ever.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="080516_Family.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/080516_Family.jpeg" width="640" height="450"> <br> <i> Koval with his father (right) at his Emory graduation this spring (Facebook). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>A recent Transportation Alternatives report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/28/trans_alt_report.php">accuses the NYPD</a> of enabling victim-blaming in crash cases by providing preliminary information to the press. It cites the case of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/15/clinton_hill_cyclist_struck.php">Lauren Davis</a>, a cyclist killed in Brooklyn earlier this year&#x2014;police initially said she had been biking against traffic, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/26/hit-and-run_lauren_davis_update.php">retracted the allegation</a>. In the case of cyclist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/cyclist_killed_park_slope.php">James Gregg</a>, police on the scene reportedly told bystanders that Gregg had grabbed onto the truck that struck him, apparently to hitch a ride. The NYPD&apos;s press office later said that Gregg had not grabbed the truck. </p>

<p>&quot;When circumstances surrounding a crash are unclear, it is irresponsible to speculate as to the actions or mentality of the deceased before an investigation has been conducted,&quot; the group writes, adding, &quot;Often at a later date, video or other evidence emerges to exonerate the victim&#x2014;but the damage has already been done.&quot; </p>

<p>The NYPD spokeswoman we discussed the Koval case with this week said that it&apos;s the responsibility of the media to check back in. &quot;We tell you guys, give us some time because it can always change,&quot; she said. &quot;Always try to call maybe later on in the day, because if we have a lot of different media e-mails [going out], we might not have time to send an update [on a crash].&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, [the NYPD] shouldn&apos;t be publishing it,&quot; countered Attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016150231/http://www.vaccaroandwhite.com/nyc-lawyers-new-york-city-attorneys-protecting-injured-cyclists-pedestrian-victims-adam-white-steve-vaccaro/">Steve Vaccaro</a>, who primarily represents cyclists and pedestrians injured and killed by reckless drivers. </p>

<p>&quot;What additional step do they need to invoke?&quot; he added. &quot;What additional step is necessary to make sure that the information is accurate, and why isn&apos;t the NYPD taking that step as a matter of course before disseminating an initial version of what happened?&quot; </p>

<p>Since his son&apos;s death, Joe Koval says, he and his wife have been talking to a Midtown North detective almost every day. Officers have yet to provide the Koval family with updates based on their surveillance video analysis, like whether the driver may have been speeding. &quot;According to them it can be six to eight months before anything&apos;s resolved, before anyone is charged, if at all,&quot; Koval said. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s killing my wife because she just can&apos;t believe that [Jack] would have done something [to put himself at risk],&quot; he added. &quot;He&apos;s just too savvy. It had to be something out of the normal to happen for him to succumb to a situation like that. He was just too sharp.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD says the investigation is ongoing. The driver remained at the scene and no charges have been filed.</p>
