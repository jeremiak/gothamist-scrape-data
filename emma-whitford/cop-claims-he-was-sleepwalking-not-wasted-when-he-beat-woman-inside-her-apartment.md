<p>An NYPD officer who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062905/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/04/nypd_honors_violent_cop.php">accused in 2014</a> of breaking into a woman&apos;s home in his boxers and assaulting her, just hours after being honored with the NYPD&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062905/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/25/after_being_honored_by_de_blasio_co.php">second-highest achievement medal</a>, made the case in court this week that he was sleepwalking&#x2014;not intoxicated&#x2014;when he broke down the woman&apos;s door, allegedly struck her 20 times, and quaffed milk from her refrigerator. </p>

<p>Eugene Donnelly, 27, was charged with misdemeanor assault and burglary after the June 10, 2014 incident. According to a preliminary investigation, Donnelly had decided to crash at a friend&apos;s Woodlawn apartment that night, and at some point strayed in his boxers, ultimately mistaking the victim&apos;s apartment for his friend&apos;s. While sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062905/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-drunk-nearly-naked-hero-found-stranger-apartment-receiving-medal-article-1.1842851">told the Daily News</a> at the time that Donnelly had been out drinking that night, his attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062905/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-sleepwalking-assaulted-woman-lawyer-article-1.2581550">told reporters</a> after a court appearance on Tuesday that his own report shows &quot;that it wasn&apos;t an alcoholic blackout. It was sleepwalking.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio awarded the four-year NYPD veteran with the Combat Cross in 2014 to acknowledge his bravery in arresting an armed teenager during a shootout in the Bronx in May 2012, while off-duty. Donnelly&apos;s attorney said that his client has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and sleeping disorders that stretch back to the 2012 shooting. (In a 2014 interview with prosecutors, Donnelly reportedly admitted that he had been an alcoholic for years, and that he broke a period of sobriety soon after the 2012 arrest that earned him his medal.) </p>

<p>Donnelly&apos;s victim reportedly balked at his lawyer&apos;s defense on Tuesday, accusing her alleged attacker of &quot;grasping at straws.&quot; She recounted in court how Donnelly allegedly pounced on her bed in his underwear, beat her, and went for the fridge before fleeing. According to a police report from that night, Donnelly allegedly said to the woman, &quot;Shhh, It&apos;s OK. Just put a shirt on,&quot; and then, &quot;Sometimes I&apos;m a good guy, but sometimes I&apos;m a bad guy.&quot;</p>

<p>Donnelly has been stripped of his badge pending the outcome of the assault case. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007062905/http://nypost.com/2016/03/29/cop-accused-of-punching-woman-in-face-says-he-was-sleepwalking/">The Post reports</a> that prosecutors are hiring their own doctors to evaluate his PTSD explanation. </p>
