					<p>Over 100 women (and about a dozen men) staged a sit-in outside of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue this morning, blocking passage in and out of the building for the second time this month as they condemned Donald Trump and what they described as &quot;decades of Republican attacks on women&apos;s bodies and access to healthcare.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We really tapped into a moment of feminist anger,&quot; said Organizer Brigid Flaherty. &quot;Multi-racial feminist anger. Women need this moment to scream and fight and sing with each other.&quot; </p>

<p>The group sat in a tight cluster blocking the tower entrance for about 30 minutes this morning, banging on pots and pans and chanting now-familiar lines like, &quot;If Trump thinks he runs this town, pussy came to shut it down!&quot; in response to a tape leaked earlier this month in which Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719121305/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">can be heard bragging</a> that he likes to &quot;grab [women] by the pussy.&quot; There were new chants in the mix as well, like, &quot;When Muslim women are under attack, what do you do? Pussy fight back!&quot; The group also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719121305/https://twitter.com/hashtag/trumpvsallofus?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=hash">kneeled in unison at the end of the action</a>, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. </p>

<p>&quot;This is really about highlighting the fact that, yes, all women are impacted by the sexist and racist language, but women of color are the most impacted,&quot; Flaherty said. </p>

<p>&quot;This protest is run by women of color worrying about our day-to-day survival,&quot; added Latchmi Gopal, a national organizer and the daughter of Guyanese immigrants. </p>

<p>Organizer Yong Jung Cho responded to Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719121305/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/donald_trump_i_couldnt_have_attacke.php">recent denials</a> of sexual assault allegations, and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719121305/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/trump_apology_non_apology.php">allusions</a> to Bill Clinton&apos;s past infidelities. Trump is &quot;deflecting and refusing to take any responsibility for any of his actions,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>Many of the protesters&apos; signs responded directly to Trump&apos;s pussy comments, like &quot;This Pussy Votes&quot; and &quot;Grab My Pussy Muhfucka I Dare You.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Although a number of Republicans have withdrawn their support following Trump&apos;s sexual assault comments, many more have remained silent and inactive on their responsibility to prevent a racist, sexual predator from taking any public office,&quot; organizers wrote in a release ahead of today&apos;s action. &quot;Even if we stop Trump in November, we know the GOP has never cared about the lives of Black, Latinx, Asian, immigrant, young, queer, poor women. The GOP and RNC must be held responsible.&quot; </p>

<p>As they did week, all of the women wore black as a symbol of militancy. Flaherty said that the NYPD presence was a bit larger, with more than a dozen police on the scene, but there were no attempts to disperse the group. </p>

<p>Asked if the organizers have more actions planned for the final weeks leading up to election day, Flaherty laughed. &quot;You&apos;re going to have to wait and watch,&quot; she said. &quot;The movement is growing.&quot; </p>

<p>Protesters across the country will be using the hashtags <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719121305/https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23GOPhandsoffme&amp;src=typd">#GOPhandsoffme</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719121305/https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23pussygrabsback&amp;src=typd">#pussygrabsback</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719121305/https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23trumpvsallofus&amp;src=tyah">#trumpvsallofus</a> throughout the day.
