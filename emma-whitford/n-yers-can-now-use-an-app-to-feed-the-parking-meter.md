<p>&quot;In the old days you usually needed a bunch of quarters and you had to watch the meter,&quot; said NYPD Chief of Transportation Thomas Chan in a statement. &quot;Now all you need is ParkNYC and your mobile device.&quot; </p>

<p>The DOT has already rolled out the program, called <a href="www.parknyc.org">ParkNYC</a>, in Manhattan between 14th and 59th Streets. Soon-to-be-old-fashioned Muni-Meters in the area have been affixed with six-digit &quot;zone codes,&quot; which app-users enter to confirm their parking location. From the city&apos;s press release: </p>

<blockquote>A ParkNYC wallet works like EZPass, and can be reloaded in increments as low as $25. Once registered, drivers may use the mobile app, internet or a toll-free number to pay for parking. 

<p>After parking, enter the unique zone number for block and length of time. After confirmation, the driver is set!</p>

<p>If time is running out and maximum time has not already been reached, parking time can be extended without returning to the car.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>It&apos;s worth noting that the app does <em>not</em> allow for unlimited parking extensions. If the parking space has a two-hour limit, that limit still applies. But, say you paid for one hour outside of a nail salon and then decided, mid-manicure, to stick around for an eyebrow wax. In that case, you wouldn&apos;t necessarily have to walk back to the car between services. The future is nigh! </p>

<p>For the skeptics, the city confirmed Monday that Muni-Meters will remain operational while the app is phased in city-wide. It&apos;s set to cover all 85,000 metered spots in the city by next summer. </p>

<p>The program, developed by &lt;ahref=&quot;http://us.parkmobile.com/&quot;&gt;Parkmobile, will not rely on city funding, according to the DOT. </p>

<p>Reporters asked Commissioner Trottenberg on Monday if she thought the city would make less revenue on parking tickets now that drivers have a built-in warning mechanism. &#x201C;The city is not trying to make money on parking fines, I&#x2019;m happy to say,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222215721/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/12/19/parknyc-parking-payment-app/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">said</a>. </p>
