<p>Power was fully restored to Grand Central Terminal in time for the Tuesday morning commute, nearly 24 hours after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160524150600/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/15/grand_central_darkness_ghosts.php">burst water pipe flooded a terminal transformer</a>, plunging the lower levels of the station and the main Lexington Avenue corridor into darkness.</p>

<p>Full power was back by 2:30 this morning, according to MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan. The terminal&apos;s lower level was completely shut down from about 9:30 a.m. on Monday until 2:00 a.m. Tuesday&#x2014;closing time for Grand Central under normal circumstances. </p>

<p>Donovan added that MTA contractors were on the scene from Monday morning, and identified the offending pipe&#x2014;six inches in diameter and located off-site. The burst pipe flooded a transformer vault at 47th Street and Madison Avenue with 18 inches of water,  knocking out power to ticket machines, lower-level platforms, and about 100 terminal stores and restaurants. </p>

<p>For the duration of Monday, trains bound for the terminal&apos;s lower levels were rerouted to the upper tracks&#x2014;somehow, without delays. The MTA says that repair work is ongoing to &quot;restore the flooded electrical infrastructure.&quot; </p>

<p>Light in the terminal&apos;s grand hall flickered only momentarily on Tuesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160524150600/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/nyregion/program-aims-to-keep-schools-diverse-as-new-york-neighborhoods-gentrify.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;_r=1">according to the NY Times</a>, before backup generators kicked in. And while the flow of commuters was thin on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday, plenty of restaurant and shop owners were stuck for hours, unable to refrigerate produce or access their personal belongings in employee lockers. One butcher at Ceriello Fine Foods was cutting steak when the lights went out, and waited for more than two hours outside the grocery to gain access to his MetroCard, before giving up and seeking an alternate route home. </p>

<p>MetroNorth told reporters on Tuesday that the departure boards and ticket machines are all up and running again&#x2014;some of them were only taking cash on Monday&#x2014;and that power has been restored to 47th Street and Madison Avenue entrances. </p>

<p>Also, this hand-written sign is no longer warding off commuters and tourists along Lexington Avenue like some quickly-scribbled &quot;back in five minutes&quot; note at a suburban gas station. </p>
