title: Two Tiny Yorkie Puppies Stolen Out Of Woman's Shopping Cart At Bed Bath & Beyond
---

	
										<p>An Upper East Side woman says her two six-week-old Yorkie puppies were stolen out of her shopping cart at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond on Monday afternoon, and she&apos;s not even sure if the thief had any idea he or she was absconding with two tiny puppies in addition to her leather purse. </p>

<p>&quot;The person who stole them must&apos;ve thought it was a pocketbook, and they now find that there are two puppies in there,&quot; 53-year-old Suzette Bonsignore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428152020/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/12/1/pair-of-puppies-stolen-from-shopper-s-cart-on-upper-east-side.html">told NY1</a>. </p>

<p>The missing puppies are named Mario and Mimi, though it&apos;s unclear if they are old enough to respond to those names. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, officers responded to a 911 call at the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond near the corner of 61st Street and First Avenue shortly after 1:00 on Monday afternoon. Bonsignore said she had the puppies inside of her leather purse, which she had placed in the child seat of her shopping cart. She had her back turned when the suspect allegedly grabbed the bag and bolted from the store. </p>

<p>&quot;They were very dear to us, we raised them from when they were newborns,&quot; Bonsignore said. &quot;We want our puppies back.&quot; </p>

<p>No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>
