<p>A Brooklyn judge said on Monday that the SUV driver who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/suv_driver_kills_30-yr-old_woman_on.php">fatally struck</a> a young woman on a Fort Greene sidewalk last month can keep his license. </p>

<p>&quot;There are no allegations of the defendant recklessly driving,&quot; said Criminal Court Judge Marguerite Dougherty in court, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160111/fort-greene/judge-refuses-suspend-license-for-driver-fatal-fort-greene-crash">DNAInfo reports</a>. </p>

<p>Victoria Nicodemus, a 30-year-old artist and curator, was shopping in Fort Greene with her boyfriend on December 6th when one Marlon Sewell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/suv_driver_kills_30-yr-old_woman_on.php">drove his 2004 Suburban SUV onto the sidewalk</a> in front of Habana Outpost on the corner of Fulton Street and South Portland Avenue. Sewell apparently swerved to avoid hitting a bus. Nicodemus was killed, and her boyfriend and another pedestrian were injured.</p>

<p>Sewell was arrested on the scene, and Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/fort_greene_nicodemus.php">ultimately charged him</a> with third degree aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle and driving without a license, both misdemeanors. </p>

<p>Sewell had previously been arrested in March 2014 for unlicensed driving. He was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://www.streetsblog.org/2015/12/09/4-times-da-ken-thompson-pursued-token-charges-against-unlicensed-killers/">summonsed for speeding in a school zone three times</a>, weeks before killing Nicodemus. </p>

<p>In court on Monday, Dougherty reportedly stated that Sewell&apos;s license had been suspended at the time of the crash because of his failure to pay child support, but had since been restored. Sewell&apos;s driving history was not mentioned. </p>

<p>The judge added that Sewell&apos;s car had been seized for the duration of an ongoing investigation into the crash, &quot;negating&quot; the necessity to suspend his license. Authorities are currently investigating Sewell&apos;s claim that he was lightheaded at the time of the crash because of a carbon monoxide leak inside the SUV. </p>

<p>According to prosecutors, video surveillance of the crash shows &#x201C;very clearly&#x201D; that Sewell was not justified in jumping the curb the night he killed Nicodemus. </p>

<p>Sewell&apos;s next court appearance is set for February 16th. He was released without bail in the immediate aftermath of the December crash. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/deadly_drivers_nyc.php">report</a> issued last month by Transportation Alternatives found that drivers who failed to yield caused 5,966 crashes resulting in death or injury&#x2014;excluding DWIs&#x2014;in 2015. Fewer than 40 of them were prosecuted for it.</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio signed the Right of Way Law in 2014, which makes failing to yield and striking pedestrians and cyclists a misdemeanor. According to the Mayor&apos;s Office on December 9th, 24 drivers had been charged with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/14/reckless_driving_nyc_nypd.php">misdemeanor failure to yield</a> for injuring or killing pedestrians in 2015. </p>

<p>Transportation Alternatives director Paul Steely White said of today&apos;s decision, &quot;Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson and Judge Marguerite Dougherty are both failing to keep this demonstrably dangerous and deadly driver from killing more innocent people.&quot;</p>

<p>Councilwoman Laurie Cumbo told mourners at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315023943/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/23/nicodemus_fort_greene_reckless_driver.php">recent vigil</a> for Nicodemus, &quot;We cannot tolerate little fines, a slap on the wrist. That is not appropriate, that is not relevant to the crime that happened at this corner. This crime destroyed a life.&quot; </p>
