<p>In response to patient and advocate concerns that New York&apos;s medical marijuana program is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104608/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/14/medical_marijuana_cuomo.php">too restrictive to serve many of its potential beneficiaries</a>, the state health department today announced a series of reforms intended to make medical THC more accessible, including home delivery state-wide as soon as next month. </p>

<p>Since the state&apos;s first medical marijuana dispensary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104608/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/see_it_marijuana_dispensary.php#photo-5">opened its doors</a> in January, off Union Square at 212 East 14th Street, patients have argued that there are too few dispensaries in New York, too widely dispersed&#x2014;New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104608/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/31/nyc_will_get_four_medical_marijuana.php">has been allotted four</a>, in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. It doesn&apos;t help that many patients suffer from chronic pain, making travel of any kind difficult. </p>

<p>&quot;In many cases, patients with serious health conditions cannot leave their homes and have difficulty accessing medical marijuana products,&quot; said the Department of Health in a release Tuesday. &quot;Within the next week, the Department will issue guidance to the registered organizations outlining requirements that must be addressed in their home delivery plan submissions.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104608/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/nyregion/in-expansion-new-yorks-medical-marijuana-program-will-offer-home-delivery.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion">According to the NY Times</a>, the service will be in effect &quot;quite likely&quot; by the end of September. </p>

<p>This week&apos;s reforms do not address New York&apos;s restriction against smoking the plant for medical purposes. Patients must either vaporize THC oils, take a THC pill, or absorb it under the tongue. </p>

<p>The state says it also plans to certify nurses to recommend marijuana to patients&#x2014;currently only a doctor&apos;s privilege&#x2014;and look into the possibility of creating a public database of doctors registered with the medical marijuana program. This, they argue, will make it easier for patients to locate doctors. &quot;Within the next 30 days, the Department will send a letter to all currently registered practitioners to determine whether they are willing to have their names listed publicly on the Department&#x2019;s webpage,&quot; DOH said. </p>

<p>But advocates say that the federal government&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104608/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/12/marijuana_dea_schedule_decision.php">recent refusal</a> to remove marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act&#x2014;a categorization for drugs that don&apos;t have medical use, that also includes heroin&#x2014;is a significant setback on the way to marijuana&apos;s full assimilation into the medical world. </p>

<p>Doctor Amy Piperato of Stony Point, New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023104608/http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=50913X1248263&amp;site=gothamist.com&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F08%2F30%2Fnyregion%2Fin-expansion-new-yorks-medical-marijuana-program-will-offer-home-delivery.html%3Frref%3Dcollection%252Fsectioncollection%252Fnyregion&amp;xguid=14733c6dea481944c590e16ed2613468&amp;xuuid=2adeab152a65f4962d7416210ba29dd4&amp;xsessid=&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2F2016%2F08%2F30%2Fmedical_marijuana_delivery.php&amp;xtz=240">told the Times</a> that some doctors figure, &#x201C;Why put yourself at risk of liability of recommending a Schedule I product?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Medical marijuana is also not covered by health insurance in New York State. While the DOH is not addressing this rule, the state says it will immediately start waiving the $50 patient and caregiver application fee for those with &quot;financial hardship.&quot; </p>

<p>Under current state law, access to said cards is limited to those suffering from cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Parkinson&apos;s disease, multiple sclerosis, intractable spasticity caused by damage to the nervous tissue of the spinal cord, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathies, and Huntington&apos;s disease. The DOH says it is now considering expanding that list to include chronic pain, stating that it has &quot;already begun conducting a review&quot; of this possibility.  </p>

<p>The DOH also plans to register five more organizations to manufacture and dispense medical marijuana over the next two years. </p>
