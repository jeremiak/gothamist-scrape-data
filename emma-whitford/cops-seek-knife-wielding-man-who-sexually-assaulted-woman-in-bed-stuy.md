<p>According to the police, the man ran past the victim, a 24-year-old woman, around 5:50 a.m. on Sunday, August 21st on Louis Place near the corner of Atlantic Avenue. He then allegedly turned towards her with a knife drawn and told her to follow him. Cops believe he led the woman to an alleyway between 19 and 19A Louis Place, and proceeded to sexually assault her. &quot;He pulled down her pants and licked her genitals,&quot; cops said. &quot;Afterward he turned her around and fondled her breasts and buttocks.&quot; </p>

<p>He then grabbed the woman&apos;s phone and fled the scene in an unknown direction. </p>

<p>Police released video of the suspect this week, who is described as 30 to 40 years old, with a mustache, about 5&apos;6&quot; tall and 190 pounds. He was last seen wearing a brown shirt and blue shorts. </p>
