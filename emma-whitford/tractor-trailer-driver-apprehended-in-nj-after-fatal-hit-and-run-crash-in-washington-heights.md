<p>A 25-year-old man was killed early this morning when the driver of a tractor-trailer struck his car on the Cross Bronx Expressway, totaled it, and fled the scene, according to the NYPD. Port Authority police apprehended the driver at a New Jersey rest stop and brought him into custody; no charges had been filed as of noon on Monday. </p>

<p>The tractor-trailer driver, whose name has not been released, slammed into the victim&apos;s car just after 3:15 a.m., in the westbound lane of the Cross Bronx Expressway near the entrance to the George Washington Bridge. The truck driver kept going towards New Jersey; EMS pronounced the other driver, the 25-year-old man, dead on the scene. There were two passengers in the car, according to police, both of whom were transported to Harlem Hospital in critical condition. </p>

<p>Port Authority police stopped the driver at the Vince Lombardi rest stop near Ridgefield, New Jersey, according to the NYPD. An investigation into the crash is ongoing. </p>

<p>In December, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329214123/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/27/3_dead_others_injured_in_crash_on_c.php">multi-car crash</a> on the Cross Bronx Expressway left three dead and at least five injured.</p>

<p>City Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329214123/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/rodriguez_hit_and_run_alert_system.php">sponsoring legislation</a> to hold hit-and-run drivers accountable, following a spate of such crashes in early January. One law would create a hit-and-run reward fund with up to $1,000 for information leading to arrest, prosecution or conviction. Another would launch an alert system, similar to AMBER Alert, to notify New Yorkers every time a hit-and-run incident occurs.</p>
