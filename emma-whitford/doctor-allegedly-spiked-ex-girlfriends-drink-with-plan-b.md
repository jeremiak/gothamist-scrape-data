<p>A 36-year-old Manhattan woman is suing her ex-boyfriend for allegedly slipping Plan B into her drink, according to multiple reports. Hyosun Kim alleges that Doctor John Ikechi Nwankwo, a New York-based neuroradiologist, was attempting to covertly prevent her from getting pregnant. She broke up with him after the alleged incident.  </p>

<p>Kim filed a $5 million lawsuit against Nwankwo in Manhattan Supreme Court on Friday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111058/http://nypost.com/2017/04/14/doctor-accused-of-slipping-plan-b-in-girlfriends-drinks/">according to the NY Post</a>. The couple was dating last spring, and had frequent unprotected sex. In May, Kim discovered &quot;a discarded box from oral contraceptives in Defendant&apos;s garbage can,&quot; according to the suit. </p>

<p>Kim then confronted Nwankwo, who allegedly admitted that he had &quot;deceptively diluted and mixed the Plan B contraceptive pill in [her] beverage because he &apos;did not want to make her pregnant.&apos;&quot; The suit also states that Nwankwo &quot;confessed that he was aware she would never have voluntarily agreed to take the Plan B pill.&quot; </p>

<p>The over-the-counter drug is taken following unprotected sex in order to prevent accidental pregnancy. </p>

<p>Nwankwo works on-call for Virtual Radiologic Professionals, LLC, according to a person who answered the phone for the company. Legal counsel for VRP did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Nwankwo himself could not immediately be reached. </p>

<p>The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111058/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-doctor-slipped-plan-b-drink-sex-suit-article-1.3055509?utm_content=bufferb721c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">reached Nwankwo</a>, who reportedly declined to comment saying, &quot;This is new to me.&quot; </p>

<p>That Nwankwo is a licensed-doctor in New York makes his actions &quot;all the more egregious,&quot; since doctors know &quot;an individual cannot be forced to ingest medication without his or her consent,&quot; according to the suit. </p>
