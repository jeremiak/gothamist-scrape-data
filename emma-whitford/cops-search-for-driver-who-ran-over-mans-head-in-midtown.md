<p>A 51-year-old man is in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital after a driver ran over his head and sped away, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>Police said preliminarily that the victim, whose name has not been released, became &quot;dizzy&quot; and fell into the street in Midtown just before he was struck on Monday morning.</p>

<p>The man fell outside of 161 West 35th Street, near Broadway, at 11:25 a.m., according to police. The driver was behind the wheel of an unidentified black van. &quot;They apparently ran over the top of his head,&quot; an NYPD spokesman said. </p>

<p>No arrests have been made as of Monday afternoon; the Collision Investigation Squad has been assigned to the case. </p>

<p>Today&apos;s crash marks the latest in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311221316/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/11/traffic_deaths_2017_vision_zero.php">string</a> of hit-and-run and fatal crashes this year, on the heels of a report that traffic fatalities trended down in 2016. Last week, Manhattan Councilmember Ydanis Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311221316/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/04/hit_run_reward_nyc.php">introduced legislation</a> that would create a hit-and-run reward fund of up to $1,000 per tip.</p>
