<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2745771&amp;GUID=E89A7483-DF00-48FE-8174-4919933C0156&amp;Options=ID|Text|&amp;Search=Cabrera">resolution</a> introduced this month by a Bronx city councilmember calls on the MTA to create a donation system for New Yorkers to fund MetroCards for low-income riders. </p>

<p>&quot;Public transit fare has increased three times since 2009, causing low income New Yorkers to spend more of their family budget on transit expenses,&quot;  Fernando Cabrera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://www.amny.com/transit/bronx-councilman-fernando-cabrera-wants-mta-metrocard-donation-system-for-low-income-riders-1.11909977">told AM New York</a>, which first reported the story. &quot;Currently there are no programs to help poor New Yorkers with public transit costs.&quot;</p>

<p>The resolution, which is symbolic because the MTA is controlled at the state level, also calls for a collection system for unused MetroCards with hanging balances. The MTA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but spokesman Kevin Ortiz told the outlet that the MTA will &quot;look at all fare media ideas during our next round of fare adjustments slated for next year.&quot; </p>

<p>Advocates argue that the reduced-fare options already in place in NYC exclude the city&apos;s most cash-strapped commuters. For example, many employers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/26/tax_free_metrocard.php">required to offer a tax deduction</a> for commuting expenses&#x2014;a benefit for New Yorkers with full-time jobs, primarily middle- and upper-class. Reductions for the elderly and disabled exclude many of the working poor, and monthly unlimited passes offer savings for those who can afford putting up $116.50 at once at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>The donation proposal comes on the heels of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/half_price_metrocards_nyc.php">campaign</a> spearheaded by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://www.ridersny.org/">Riders Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://www.cssny.org/">Community Service Society</a>, calling on the city to establish a half-price MetroCard program for the working poor. According to a report released in conjunction with the joint Riders Alliance-Community Service Society campaign [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://b.3cdn.net/nycss/7169ea001b71493ce9_lvm6b2ptw.pdf">PDF</a>], about 800,000 New Yorkers, excluding seniors and the disabled, live at or below the federal poverty threshold, or $11,880 for a single adult. Under the proposed plan, a single ride would cost about $1.35; riders who purchase monthly cards could save up to $700 per year.</p>

<p>Rebecca Bailin of the Riders Alliance said Tuesday that while Cabrera&apos;s resolution is encouraging, her group is still pushing for a broader policy change. &quot;We appreciate the thinking. We think he&apos;s really on the right track,&quot; she said, adding that with a new half-fare policy, &quot;people can have a way to apply, and it&apos;s fair and not ad hoc.&quot; </p>

<p>In the coming weeks, Bailin&apos;s group is hopeful that Community Service Society head <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://www.cssny.org/staff/entry/david-r.-jones">David Jones</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111849/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mta-board-waiting-mayor-de-blasio-appoint-nominees-article-1.2650354">one of three nominees</a> to the MTA&apos;s Board of Directors, will be accepted to his post.</p>

<p>&quot;If it happens soon that&apos;s really big news,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s fighting for this issue.&quot;  </p>
