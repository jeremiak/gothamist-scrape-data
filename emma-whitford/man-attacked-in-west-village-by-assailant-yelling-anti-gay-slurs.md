<p>Police are looking for a man who they believe yelled homophobic slurs at another man in the West Village over the weekend, before shoving him from behind into the window frame of a West 4th Street tapas bar. The NYPD is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, a 32-year-old man was walking on West 4th Street between Jones and Cornelia streets just after 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, October 2nd, when a man in his mid-20s approached him and began yelling homophobic slurs. The younger man then allegedly pushed the 32-year-old from behind, causing him to fall and hit his head on the window frame of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101331/http://lasramblas.nyc/">Las Ramblas</a>, a tapas bar at 170 West 4th Street. </p>

<p>Police have acquired surveillance footage of the incident. A spokesman for the department could not confirm what prompted the incident, or what slurs were used. </p>

<p>EMS transported the victim to Beth Israel Hospital, where he was treated and released for a head laceration and general pain. &quot;It required a staple, so it was quite a big laceration,&quot; an NYPD spokesman said. </p>

<p>The suspect is believed to be about 6&apos;0&quot; tall and 240 pounds. He was last seen wearing a black t-shirt, black pants, and black sneakers. </p>
