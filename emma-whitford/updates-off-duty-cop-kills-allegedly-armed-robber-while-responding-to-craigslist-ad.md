<p>According to the NYPD, the off-duty officer, whose name has not been released, met two men around 10:30 p.m. on 145th Avenue near Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, in the Springfield Gardens neighborhood of Queens near JFK Airport. The off-duty officer was reportedly there to discuss the sale of a white BMW that had been advertised on Craigslist.</p>

<p>The officer reportedly got into an argument with the men over the price of the vehicle, who subsequently attempted to rob him, according to police. An NYPD spokesman said that one of the alleged robbers proceeded to produce a &quot;firearm&quot; and demanded that the officer hand over his wallet. The officer then took out his weapon and fired five rounds, striking the man who had drawn his weapon. The second suspect fled the scene in the white BMW with the officer&apos;s wallet.  </p>

<p>An FDNY spokesperson says first responders were called to 177-39 145th Avenue in the Springfield Gardens neighborhood of Queens, near JFK Airport, at 10:36 p.m. They transported the wounded man to Jamaica Medical Center in critical condition, and he was pronounced dead at the hospital. </p>

Asked if the robbery suspect had produced a BB gun, the NYPD spokesman, Detective Martin Speechley, said, &quot;I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s under investigation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was laying in bed, watching TV and I heard a total of five to six gunshots, loud gunshots, and about five minutes later, I heard sirens and helicopters and I knew it was something serious,&quot; one neighbor told the news outlet. </p>

<p>&quot;The officer was standing there with a gun in his hand pointing it at the body,&quot; said a 20-year-old witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031333/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/man-shot-off-duty-police-officer-queens-article-1.2458275">told the News</a>. </p>

<p>As of this morning, the robbery suspect who fled the scene is still at large. The officer was taken to North Shore-Long Island Jewish Hospital to be treated for ringing of the ears. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>A plainclothes NYPD detective shot a 20-year-old robbery suspect in the right arm and torso in Bed-Stuy last month, after the suspect allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031333/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/09/robbery_suspect_shot_brooklyn.php">pulled a realistic-looking BB gun</a> on him and told him to hand over his possessions.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The NYPD has identified the deceased as 30-year-old Devon Holder of Brooklyn. An image of Holder&apos;s weapon, a black air pistol recovered on the scene, has been released by the department. Holder did not discharge the BB gun. According to the NYPD, the suspect &quot;did forcibly remove the officer&apos;s wallet at gunpoint.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031333/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/crook-shot-off-duty-shocked-learn-officer-article-1.2458776">The Daily News has identified</a> the off-duty officer as one Mehbubur Rehaman, although the NYPD declined a request for confirmation. </p>

<p>The tabloid reports that Holder removed a police badge from the off-duty officer&apos;s pocket in addition to his wallet. Holder began to back away when he realized that the was confronting an NYPD officer. After the first shot was fired, Holder began to run away. The fatal shot to his torso was reportedly fired as he fled. </p>

<p>The NYPD would only confirm that the officer discharged five rounds, striking Holder in the left leg and torso. </p>
