<p>The Parks department is denying reports that it had any intention of canceling weekly women&apos;s-only swimming hours at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502003313/https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B085/facilities/indoor-pools/metropolitan-pool">Metropolitan Pool</a> on Bedford Avenue, a public pool that serves a large Hasidic community with strict modesty rules. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502003313/http://nypost.com/2016/05/27/proposal-to-end-womens-only-pool-hours-nixed-after-backlash/">As first reported by the NY Post</a>, men are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502003313/https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/recreationcenters/B085/schedule#Pool">barred from the pool</a> on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays between 9:15 and 11:00 a.m.</p>

<p>&quot;No rule change has taken place,&quot; said Parks spokesman Sam Biederman in a statement. &quot;Separate-gender swimming hours remain in effect at Metropolitan Pool.&quot; </p>

<p>But while it won&apos;t be altering pool hours this year, Parks confirmed that it is in talks with the NYC Commission on Human Rights about the legality of the practice. The CCHR recently received a tip about the pool&apos;s gender-specific swimming hours, which they say may be in violation of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502003313/http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/law/nyc-human-rights.shtml">NYC Human Rights Law</a> prohibiting discrimination based on gender, race or creed. </p>

<p>&quot;The NYC Commission on Human Rights is working with the Parks Department to review their pool policies,&quot; stated CCRH spokesman Seth Hoy.</p>

<p>According to Parks, the confusion stemmed from a typo on signage announcing summer pool hours. But Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind countered on Friday that a top Parks official confirmed the planned rule-change to his office earlier this week, only to backpedal in the face of community opposition. </p>

<p>&quot;The women got in touch with us and they said they were told by the lifeguard that this program [would be] ending,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course they were very distraught.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The point is about being culturally sensitive,&quot; Hikind added, arguing that disbanding &apos;Women&apos;s Swim&apos; would be akin to banning Hasidic women from the pool altogether. &quot;These women don&apos;t have a television at home. A lot of other sources of entertainment we enjoy, they don&apos;t have. Today the more [skin] you show the more you get, but for these people the modesty is important.&quot; </p>

<p>Parks did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hikind&apos;s allegations. &quot;I&apos;m going to be pursuing this,&quot; the Assemblyman added, suggesting he&apos;ll fight any efforts by the city to disband the practice in the future.</p>
