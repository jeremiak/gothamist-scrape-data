<p>Police dispersed crowds from Brooklyn Bridge Park late Tuesday afternoon due to a &quot;disorderly group,&quot; according to the NYPD. The partial evacuation prompted park-goers to stream along residential Brooklyn Heights streets to the chagrin of neighbors.</p>

<p>&quot;I was walking out of the neighborhood at about 2:00 p.m. and I saw masses of kids coming down Joralemon Street [toward the park], and I emailed the NYPD and community members and I said there may be trouble at Pier 2 brewing,&quot; said Linda de Rosa, Vice President of the Willowtown Association, a neighborhood civic group.</p>

<p>&quot;We can&apos;t walk on the streets for fear of this happening,&quot; she added. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of very unsavory activity.&quot; </p>

<p>The park closure recalls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031201925/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/26/brooklyn_bridge_park_nypd.php">similar</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031201925/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/18/brooklyn_bridge_park_pier_2.php">NYPD actions</a> last April and May, prompted by large gatherings planned on Facebook and reports of fighting. During a community meeting last spring, 84th Precinct Deputy Inspector Sergio Centa assured local residents that he was prioritizing policing efforts on the pier, following a surge of complaints from neighbors who felt their safety and quality of life had been compromised. </p>

<p>Pier 2, a two-acre flattop with basketball and handball courts and a rollerskating rink, is now in its fourth season. It was closed five times in under a month last spring. </p>

<p>Police responded to a &quot;disorderly group&quot; on Pier 2 at 4:10 p.m. on Tuesday, and dispersed it, according to a spokesman for the NYPD. There were no arrests, and no summonses were issued. The police could not confirm alleged fights on the pier, or along Joralemon Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031201925/https://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2017/4/11/cops-evacuate-brooklyn-bridge-park-tuesday-due-large-disorderly-crowds">as reported by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle</a> (an unnamed person told the outlet that he had witnessed &quot;about ten&quot; fights on the pier). </p>

<p>One criminal complaint, filed from the park at 3:30 p.m., alleges that a 15-year-old girl was punched and kicked by a &quot;group of unknown individuals.&quot; Her phone and MetroCard were stolen, she told police. </p>

<p>The Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation issued a statement saying, &quot;BBP staff worked closely with the NYPD&apos;s 84th precinct Tuesday to manage crowding issues and ensure both a safe clearing of overcrowded park sections and continued operations throughout the rest of the park.&quot;</p>

<p>Park neighbors argued last spring that the Pier 2 basketball courts were to blame for unruly crowds, attracting teenagers from local high schools. Residents of Joralemon Street&#x2014;a treelined stretch that connects park visitors directly to the waterfront&#x2014;demanded that the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation and NYPD take extra measure to discourage fighting in the park and surrounding neighborhood, including increased NYPD presence and street closures.</p>

<p>Gothamist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031201925/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/18/brooklyn_bridge_park_pier_2.php">spoke to park-goers</a> on Pier 2 last spring, who expressed concern about the animosity coming from the neighborhood, as well as the increased police presence. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s bad that people fight, but we all get to hang out and meet new people,&quot; said Kahliyah Brown, 17, a student at Brooklyn High School of the Arts. &quot;The amount of cops that come here, they pressure us and make us feel a little unsafe rather than protected.&quot; </p>

<p>The 84th Precinct increased its park detail to 25 officers last summer, up from just two dedicated cops on Pier 2 in 2015. The park also added more scheduled programing, like basketball clinics, and promised to host a meeting for local teenagers to discuss &quot;how we can best work together to ensure a safe environment.&quot; </p>

<p>This week is spring break, and the park is hosting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031201925/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/events/big-and-little-skills-academy-spring-fling">full week of afternoon basketball clinics</a> on the pier to accommodate students. Yesterday&apos;s dispersal coincided with a planned 3 v. 3 tournament for boys. </p>

<p>&quot;It didn&apos;t work did it?&quot; de Rosa, of the civic association, said. &quot;So there you go.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ll take the repercussions of being called NIMBYs, because it&apos;s ridiculous,&quot; she added. &quot;Of course it&apos;s a beautiful day. Of course people want to use the park. But these giant problems are on Pier 2. That&apos;s all I know. It&apos;s always Pier 2.&quot; </p>
