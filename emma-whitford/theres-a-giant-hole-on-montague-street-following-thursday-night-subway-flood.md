<p>MTA workers spent Thursday night scrubbing the Court Street R train platform and checking subway tracks and signals for damage after a 12-inch water main burst on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. Regular train service was restored by 8:30 p.m., according to the MTA, but 100 local residents and 25 businesses were without water service overnight while the Department of Environmental Protection made repairs. </p>

<p>Hurricane Sandy repair work to the Montague tube helped the smelly brown water drain faster, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101540/https://twitter.com/MTA_NYCT_Vocero/status/837470043839549440">according to</a> MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz. </p>

<p>All but three buildings have water service restored as of this morning, according to a DEP spokesperson. There is, however, still a very large hole on Montague Street. </p>
