<p>A group of affordable housing advocates and unions that have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/east_new_york_gentrification.php">spent the last year</a> vehemently protesting Mayor de Blasio&apos;s $41 billion affordable housing plan&#x2014;arguing that it would not create enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/04/east_new_york_gentrification.php">truly affordable housing</a> and hinges on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/05/affordable_housing_unions.php">non-union labor</a>&#x2014;issued a surprise endorsement of the mayor&apos;s plan on Sunday. The announcement came less than a week after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/https://www.facebook.com/RealAffordability">Real Affordability For All coalition (RAFA)</a> threatened, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160309/civic-center/critics-cancel-protest-against-de-blasios-rezoning-bid-citing-progress">postponed</a>, acts of civil disobedience at City Hall citing &quot;productive movement in current negotiations&quot; with the City. </p>

<p>One of the pillars of Mayor de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://www.nyc.gov/html/housing/assets/downloads/pdf/housing_plan.pdf">affordable housing plan</a>, known as mandatory inclusionary zoning, would allow developers to build taller, denser buildings in fifteen targeted low-income neighborhoods&#x2014;from East New York to Jerome Avenue in the Bronx&#x2014;so long as 25-30% of the apartments rent for less than market rate. </p>

<p>RAFA, among the most vocal critics of de Blasio&apos;s plan, had argued that the rezoning would produce a glut of new apartments too expensive for long-time residents of these neighborhoods. For example, only 13% of the apartments planned for East New York would be affordable to the 53% of current residents who make less than $35,000 a year. </p>

<p>According to RAFA, they threw their support behind the mayor after he agreed to conduct a study of the neighborhoods slated for rezoning. </p>

<p>&quot;We know Mayor de Blasio shares our core progressive values, and he has listened to our concerns,&quot; said RAFA Director Maritza Silva-Farrell in a statement issued Sunday. &quot;That&apos;s why we support this stronger, more robust affordable housing plan, along with the administration&apos;s commitment to do a study that will examine mechanisms for achieving even deeper affordability and job standards in new housing.&quot;</p>

<p>De Blasio&apos;s plan has been formally rejected by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/manhattan_affordable_housing.php">50 of 59 impacted community boards</a>, and four of the five borough presidents. Asked if she believed RAFA&apos;s endorsement would reverse that opposition, Silva-Farrell said, &quot;I think things will change once we have a program in place to think about rezoning differently.&quot; </p>

<p>RAFA says the Mayor initially resisted the study, but &quot;reversed his position&quot; after RAFA &quot;pushed&quot; him. The study won&apos;t be conducted until after the mayor&apos;s plan is passed.</p>

<p>Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for the mayor, says the vaguely-defined study will &quot;identify even more tools to reach New Yorkers with quality jobs and affordable housing.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="031416_BDB.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/031416_BDB.jpeg" width="640" height="428"> <br> <i>Advocates dropped a banner in City Hall chambers during an East New York rezoning hearing earlier this month reading &quot;East New York cannot afford de Blasio&apos;s New York&quot; (via RAFA&apos;s Facebook). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>More substantive changes to the zoning laws appear to be coming from the City Council and Brooklyn councilmember and Housing Committee Chair Jumaane Williams.</p>

<p>Politico New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/03/8593725/city-council-zeroing-final-housing-deal-increase-affordability">reported today</a> that amendments to the mayor&apos;s plan favored by the City Council would create a deeper level of affordability in the zoning scheme.</p>

<p>One amendment would set aside one fifth of new apartments to tenants making 40% of the AMI, or $31,075 for a family of three. Another would require that in buildings where 25% of units must be affordable for those making 60% of the AMI, 10% of all units would have to go to residents who make only 40%. </p>

<p>&quot;We want to make sure that there aren&apos;t parts of this city that are built with no deeply affordable units,&quot; Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://gothamgazette.com/index.php/government/6222-sides-near-a-deal-on-major-zoning-changes-aimed-at-creating-affordable-housing">told Gotham Gazette</a>. &quot;There shouldn&apos;t be a project where some of the units aren&apos;t of the deepest affordability&#x2014;30 percent or below of AMI must be considered.&quot; Silva-Farrell was careful to reiterate on Monday that RAFA and Williams are working together.</p>

<p>The rezoning changes could be approved as soon as this afternoon. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re on the verge of implementing the strongest, most progressive requirement for affordable housing of any city in the country,&quot; mayoral spokesman Wiley Norvell said in a statement. </p>

<p>The new amendments are not as strong as what RAFA was fighting for: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/http://www.realaffordabilityforall.org/2015/09/report-real-affordable-communities.html">50% of housing to be affordable</a> for people at or below the <em>neighborhood</em> median income, rather than the metropolitan area median income. The Mayor&apos;s office has not agreed to this proposal, nor have they agreed to use local construction workers and pay them a prevailing wage, which RAFA had also argued for [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185617/https://drive.google.com/a/gothamist.com/file/d/0B4XPGlCFG9VvWm1VQUJMUDhPMVU/view">PDF</a>]. </p>

<p>At a press conference on Monday, Mayor de Blasio fielded questions from reporters on the nature of the study, and whether the City&apos;s agreement to conduct such a study ultimately won RAFA&apos;s endorsement. </p>

<p>In his response, the Mayor suggested that RAFA was more swayed by his own vision, than by the promise of a study.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s fair to say that sometimes when people get to know a plan better, they see more to like about it,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;I don&apos;t want to speak for RAFA, but I believe they realized the extent of our plan. We want to get to a good plan with the council, and then get back to work looking at what more we can do.&quot; </p>

<p>Silva-Farrell reiterated her confidence in RAFA&apos;s endorsement on Monday. </p>

<p>&quot;The thing that makes me confident is that we&apos;re going to be able to have a working group with our coalition in City Hall,&quot; she said. &quot;Now it&apos;s not so much <em>can</em> we do it [make the affordability deeper], the study is going to be about <em>how</em> we do it.&quot; </p>
