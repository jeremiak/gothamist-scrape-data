<p>The Queens Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City earned landmark status on Tuesday, joining the ranks of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/party-venues/weddings-and-special-events/boathouse/">Prospect Park Boathouse</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/http://www.siferry.com/terminals.html">Whitehall Ferry Terminal</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Savings_Bank">New York Savings Bank</a> in all of its corporate, neon glory. The 147-foot-long sign made it through a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/24/queens_pepsi-cola_sign_landmark.php">Landmarks Preservation Commission gauntlet</a> in February, when officials assessed the landmark-ability of 95 NYC buildings and historical sites&#x2014;some of which had been backlogged in the agency&apos;s system for five decades. Those still under consideration will receive a final vote by December.</p>

<p>Installed in 1936 on top of the long-since-demolished Queens Pepsi bottling plant, the sign has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/9/dtg-greenwood-cemetery-landmarks-backlog-2016-02-26-bk.html?utm_source=20160224&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=storylink&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter">dismantled and shifted</a> along the Queens waterfront multiple times since the late 1990s (the current sign is actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/realestate/signs-signal-both-profit-and-controversy.html?pagewanted=1">a 1994 restoration</a>, as the c. 1930s sign was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/realestate/signs-signal-both-profit-and-controversy.html"> severely damaged in a storm</a>). In 2013, a 25-story apartment tower on the Queens waterfront was partially recessed to give the sign a respectful amount of breathing room.</p>

<p>The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/nyregion/pepsi-cola-sign-in-queens-gains-landmark-status.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion">reports</a> that the sign had been under consideration for landmark status for 28 years leading up to yesterday&apos;s approval. </p>

<p>Seven other sites earned landmark status this week, including the Green-Wood Cemetery Chapel, the Van Sicklen House in the Gravesend, and the main sanctuary, parish house and rectory of St. Michael&#x2019;s Episcopal Church on the Upper West Side. </p>

<p>Describing the Pepsi-Cola sign as less than &quot;traditional&quot; this week, the LPC made the case that they&apos;re <em>with it</em>. &quot;Tastes and definitions of landmarks continue to change, as does New York,&quot; they said in a statement. &quot;Public perception of the quotidian sights of our city, like signage, can evolve quickly once something that has always been there, suddenly, is not.&quot; We see you, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035937/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/20/kentile_floors_last_stand.php">Kentile Floors sign</a>. </p>
