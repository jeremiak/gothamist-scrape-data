<p>A New York Federal District Court judge held a short-notice hearing on Tuesday afternoon in relation to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/voter_registration_lawsuit.php">lawsuit filed yesterday</a> against the state by dozens of New York voters, alleging that their registrations in the Democratic party had been purged or altered, preventing them from voting in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/ny_primary_live_updates.php">today&apos;s presidential primary</a>. </p>

<p>The lawsuit, which claims that voters inexplicably dropped from the voter rolls are being denied their constitutional rights, called on the judge to instate a hearing process by which New Yorkers who believe their registration has been wrongfully purged might defend themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;Usually what happens is the Board of Elections takes your provisional ballot, and checks it against the voter rolls. If it it doesn&apos;t match they throw it out,&quot; said attorney Jonathan Clarke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/https://www.facebook.com/TheYoungTurks/videos/10153583330949205/">outside the courtroom this afternoon</a>. &quot;What we&apos;re asking is that your vote stay counted until the Board of Elections can actually [prove you&apos;re not registered].&quot; </p>

<p>The suit also calls for an open primary, which would essentially eliminate the need to prove party affiliation in the first place. Under New York&apos;s current <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/12/ny_primary_battle_independent.php">closed primary system</a>, only voters registered as either Democrats or Republicans can vote.</p>

<p>Judge Joanna Seybert on Tuesday did not rule to open the primary, nor did she issue an order preserving provisional ballots. </p>

<p>Instead, she ruled that every single county in New York State will have to defend its voter registration process, at a hearing to be scheduled for a future date. &quot;The judge essentially kicked the ball down the road,&quot; said reporter Jordan Chariton in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/https://www.facebook.com/TheYoungTurks/videos/10153583636724205/">video update from outside the courtroom</a>. &quot;The motion was not dismissed immediately, so the lawyers now have to get representatives from each New York county into the courtroom at a later date to defend if and why there have been voter purges.&quot;</p>

<p>Today it came to light that the New York City Board of Elections had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/twice_as_many_brooklyn_democrats_we.php">removed 126,000 Brooklyn Democrats from active voter status</a> since last fall. Board Director Michael Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/https://www.wnyc.org/story/de-blasio-demands-explanation-boe-drops-126000-brooklyn-democrats/">told WNYC</a> this morning that the precipitous drop broke down like this: 44,000 voters were inactive; 70,000 had been removed from the inactive voter list; and 12,000 people had moved out of the borough. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/http://nypost.com/2016/04/19/54000-brooklyn-voters-vanish-ahead-of-primary-day/">demanded an explanation</a> for the sudden drop on Monday, and Comptroller Scott Stringer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/comptroller_will_audit_nyc_board_of.php">announced</a> that he would conduct an audit in the wake of today&apos;s reports from frustrated voters. Ryan confirmed that Brooklyn was between six and twelve months behind updating its records, in part because of a number of retirements and staff illnesses. </p>

<p>New York voters still headed to the polls before 9:00 tonight, who believe that their registration has been wrongfully purged or altered, should seek an individual judge&apos;s order to defend their right to vote, the judge said. </p>

<p>Reached for comment on Tuesday, case attorney Shyla Nelson said that her team would be reviewing the logistics of gathering representatives from every county &quot;literally within the next couple hours.&quot; </p>

<p>She added that the suggestion that voters seek a judge&apos;s order on short notice before 9:00 p.m. is impractical, considering voters&apos; weeknight work and family obligations. &quot;It puts a burden on the voter. We don&apos;t think it&apos;s a solution,&quot; she said. Instead, she encouraged New Yorkers still headed to the polls to bring any evidence of alleged fraudulent purging with them, and demand a provisional ballot. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s definitely worth a try,&quot; Nelson said, adding, &quot;My heart breaks for the voters who have been disenfranchised today.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve got a refresher on how to seek a judge&apos;s order and file a provisional ballot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016071724/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/primary_voting_guide_2016.php">here</a>. </p>

<p>New York State Board of Elections spokesman Thomas Connolly declined to comment on today&apos;s ruling specifically. &quot;Right now our main focus is helping the local elections boards have as smooth a primary as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;We haven&apos;t yet considered what implications the judge&apos;s order might have, if any.&quot;  </p>
