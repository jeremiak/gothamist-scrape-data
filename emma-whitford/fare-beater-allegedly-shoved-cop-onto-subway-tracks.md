<p>Police are searching for a man who allegedly knocked an NYPD officer onto the subway tracks at a Queens E train station early Sunday morning. According to the NYPD, he and three companions skipped their fares by walking through an open service gate, drawing the attention of two police officers. The group fled, and the man in question pushed one of the officers onto the tracks, according to police. </p>

<p>The NYPD is seeking the whole group&#x2014;two men and two women, all in their 20s&#x2014;in relation to the assault. All four suspects were captured on surveillance video. </p>

<p>One of the men in the group&#x2014;it&apos;s unclear which one&#x2014;shoved the officer around 12:20 a.m. on Sunday at the Parsons-Archer Avenue E subway stop in Jamaica, officials said. The fallen officer&apos;s partner stopped to pull him out of the trackbed, giving the suspects enough time to run out of the station. </p>

<p>The officer was not injured. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. </p>
