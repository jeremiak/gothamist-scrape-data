<p>In an essay titled, accurately, &quot;The Time I Got Stabbed In The Neck,&quot; we learn from Hwang that his attacker, still at large, managed to sever Hwang&apos;s vertebral artery. According to the playwright, the same injury has been known to cause strokes and permanent loss of feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;I realize how incredibly lucky I am to have survived with no long-term damage,&quot; he writes. </p>

<p>Hwang, 58, was walking home laden with groceries on South Portland Street between Lafayette and DeKalb Avenues around 8:50 p.m. on Sunday, November 29th when he was attacked, according to the NYPD. </p>

<p>In the playwright&apos;s own words: </p>

<blockquote>Carrying my groceries around 9 p.m., I crossed onto my block, about a dozen doors from my home. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I felt as if someone had hit me on the back of my head. I yelled an expletive. Turning around, I saw the silhouette of someone running away across the street. I wasn&#x2019;t going to take off to pursue my assailant, so I decided to continue home.

<p>But I found that I couldn&apos;t walk steadily and veered, first into a wall, then into a parked car. I placed my hand to my neck, and it came away covered in blood.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Normally, in the case of a severed artery, a surgeon will intervene to cap it. But because Hwang&apos;s injury was so close to his skull, there was an apparent risk of brain damage. </p>

<p>Instead, the following day Hwang went under the knife of a Mount Sinai neuroendovascular surgeon for more than four hours. The procedure was not a a simple one. As Hwang writes:  &quot;...the surgical team performed minimally invasive surgery, navigating through my arterial system from my groin to the severed artery, which they closed off with over a dozen coils and vascular plugs.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Hwang also details the ongoing investigation into his attack, which he believes may have been a hate crime. He references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000725/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/16/asian_women_attacked_nyc.php">attacks</a> on Asian American women that proliferated last year, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000725/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/16/16-yr-old_girl_viciously_slashed_in.php">slashing</a>, days after he was attacked, of a 16-year-old Chinese girl in Queens. </p>

<p>&quot;I have since learned that Asians are seen as easy targets because of perceived language barriers and a reluctance to report crimes,&quot; Hwang writes. </p>

<p>The NYPD believes that the November 29th attack was perpetrated by someone with no personal connection to Hwang himself. Officials released a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000725/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/04/david_henry_hwang_slash.php">grainy surveillance still</a> of a suspect in December&#x2014;an individual with his or her back turned to the camera. </p>
