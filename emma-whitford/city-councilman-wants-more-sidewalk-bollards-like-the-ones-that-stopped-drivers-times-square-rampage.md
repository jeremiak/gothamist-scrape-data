<p>Nearly 24 hours after Richard Rojas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/18/times_square_lockdown.php">allegedly used his car as a murder weapon in Times Square</a>, killing one pedestrian and injuring 22 others, City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez stood a few steps from where Rojas&apos;s Honda Accord came to rest, lodged on top of two steel bollards. He and Transportation Alternatives Director Paul Steely White demanded that the crash be treated with the same gravity as an act of terrorism, though it&apos;s not being investigated as such, and called for an immediate safety upgrade on the plaza, as well as other pedestrian-heavy intersections in NYC. </p>

<p>&quot;Be it a terrorist, a reckless or drunk driver or even someone who loses control at the wrong moment, many of our sidewalks remain terribly vulnerable to the type of tragedy we witnessed in Times Square yesterday,&quot; Rodriguez stated, adding, &quot;This was no accident and to call it such removes the necessary accountability we must face as a city.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It was those bollards that kept that driver yesterday from killing more people,&quot; Steely White added. &quot;We are here in the lens of Times Square. Everyone&apos;s watching, right? But most often it&apos;s a regular street in a regular neighborhood in New York City.&quot; </p>

<p>During Friday&apos;s conference, Rodriguez announced that he is planning to introduce legislation to require metal bollards along sidewalks with heavy pedestrian traffic, as well as in front of schools. He also told reporters that he envisions a Times Square entirely free of cars between 42nd and 47th Streets, and would support a DOT study to that effect. &quot;I think we should look at the possibility,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>But Rodriguez later clarified his position, after State Senator Brad Holyman stepped to the mic to say, &quot;I oppose closing Times Square to traffic,&quot; citing concerns about traffic spilling into residential side streets.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope that one day we can close Broadway from 59th to Union Square,&quot; Rodriguez told Gothamist. &quot;I believe at some point we should be aiming to see this area only dedicated to pedestrians, and having a plan of how vehicles should come here only to do deliveries.&quot;  </p>

<p>For now, he said, his priority is bollards. </p>

<p>More than a dozen New Yorkers were killed by curb-jumping drivers in 2015, according to Transportation Alternatives. That Halloween, a 10-year-old girl, her grandfather and another man were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/02/heartbreaking_vigil_held_for_bronx.php">killed</a> when a driver crashed into a group of Halloween trick-or-treaters on a Bronx sidewalk. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/reckless-driving-deadlier-terror-article-1.3177621">Daily News op-ed</a> from Steely-White&apos;s group also notes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/07/suv_driver_midtown_death.php">three</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/woman_fatally_struck_by_driver_whil.php">pedestrians</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/elderly_woman_killed_by_cabbie.php">killed</a> by drivers in Midtown last year. </p>

<p>&quot;I think there were two really disturbing things about how this tragedy was categorized yesterday, by many New Yorkers,&quot; Steely White said. &quot;That, one, it was an accident, and somehow we should breathe a sigh of relief because it was not some intentional terrorist occurrence,&quot; he said. &quot;But these tragedies are no less preventable than that sort of violence.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The other disturbing characterization was that it was a car that jumped the curb, as if it was some disembodied object that had done it by itself, without a driver making a very important decision or a series of decisions,&quot; he added. &quot;We can design the system to account for these kinds of decisions.&quot;</p>

<p>Rojas was arrested at the scene and has since been charged with murder and attempted murder; police are still trying to determine whether he was under the influence of drugs at the time.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It appears to be intentional in the sense that he was troubled and lashing out,&#x201D; Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170519/civic-center/richard-rojas-times-square-driver-murder-charges-drugs">told Brian Lehrer on WNYC this morning</a>. &#x201C;What we know continues to confirm not an act of terror.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio&apos;s office released its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519192309/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/24/vision_zero_report.php">third Vision Zero report</a> in February, showing overall traffic fatalities have decreased 23 percent since the program was launched in 2013, bucking a 14 percent nationwide increase in the same period. Still, 145 pedestrians died in 2016, as opposed to 139 in 2015; and there were 18 cyclist deaths last year, up from 14 in 2015. </p>

<p>The DOT did not immediately respond to a request for comment on plans to expand pedestrian access in Times Square. </p>

<p>Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, offered condolences to the injured, adding, &quot;It is premature for the Alliance to have a response to any specific proposals, each of which should be looked at carefully as part of the City&apos;s already-planned study of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic in Times Square.&quot; </p>
