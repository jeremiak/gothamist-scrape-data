<p>A 28-year-old gay man was attacked on the 1 train in Morningside Heights on Saturday night in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. The suspect, who remains at large, allegedly called the man a &quot;faggot&quot; and punched him in the chest with a sharp object, inflicting puncture wounds. </p>

<p>Police say the victim was riding a northbound 1 train with his partner and sister around 7:10 p.m. on Saturday, when he and another man got into a &quot;verbal dispute.&quot; The victim, whose name has not been released, later told police that the suspect threatened him, saying, &quot;Watch what happens to you at the next stop.&quot; </p>

<p>As the train entered the Cathedral Parkway 110th Street station, the suspect allegedly moved to exit the train, and punched the victim with an unknown sharp object on the way out. Cops said the victim followed his assailant onto the platform, where the two men got into a &quot;physical altercation.&quot; The suspect fled the scene, and had not been arrested as of Monday morning. </p>

<p>The victim was taken to St. Luke&#x2019;s Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition Saturday night. He was wounded in chest, as well as the left side of his torso. </p>

<p>Cops described the person they&apos;re looking for as a Hispanic man, about 30 years old and 6&apos;1&quot; tall. He was last seen wearing a white shirt and khaki shorts. </p>
