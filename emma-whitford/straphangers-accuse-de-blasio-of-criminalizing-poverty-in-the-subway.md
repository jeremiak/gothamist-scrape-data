<p>Dozens of low-income New Yorkers and advocates gathered around the entrance to the R train at City Hall on Wednesday morning, holding up oversized summonses for subway fare evasion. One read &quot;Immigrant Worker,&quot; another &quot;CUNY Student.&quot; In the spot designated for violation details, all of the slips read &quot;too poor.&quot; </p>

<p>The faux summonses were intended to illustrate the high arrest rate in the subway, on the same day the City Council Transportation Committee planned to discuss a possible solution to what advocates see as a costly and preventable criminality pipeline. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/metrocard_reduced_fare.php">Offer half-price MetroCards,</a> they argue, and City Hall could protect thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers from arrest, fines, imprisonment and, for many, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/25/nypd_turnstile_jumping_deportation.php">collateral immigration consequences</a>. </p>

<p>The NYPD arrested 5,137 New Yorkers for fare evasion between January and mid-March this year, according to the Riders Alliance, 90 percent of whom are black or Latino. Last year, fare evasion was NYC&apos;s second most common arrest charge, resulting in nearly 26,000 arrests. </p>

<p>&quot;Here we are in front of City Hall, in one of the richest cities in the country,&quot; said Jody Morales, an attorney with South Bronx Legal Services. &quot;And just a few train stops north of here, nearly 40 percent of our constituents are living below the federal poverty line.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Since the implementation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/20/free_subway_swipes.php">broken windows policing</a>, entire communities are being incarcerated, particularly for fare evasion,&quot; she added. &quot;I see it every day as a public defender. Hundreds of people being criminalized because they didn&apos;t have money to get on the train. We&apos;re talking about people here. People like minors who didn&apos;t have money to get to school, or to work, or to important appointments.&quot;  </p>

<p>A recent study [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://b.3cdn.net/nycss/7169ea001b71493ce9_lvm6b2ptw.pdf">PDF</a>] released by transit reform advocates found that more than a quarter of low-income working New Yorkers were unable to afford subway or bus fare at least once in 2015. </p>

<p>&quot;Most of my experience with police is for hopping the train or the bus,&quot; said Victor Pacheco, a member of VOCAL-NY. &quot;There are times where I just don&apos;t have the money, but I&apos;m out here trying to better myself and do something for the future. One time I was actually on my way to a job interview and had a suit on and everything.&quot; </p>

<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/half_price_metrocards_nyc.php">last spring</a>, transit advocates have urged Mayor de Blasio to fund a half-price MetroCard program for New York City&apos;s working poor&#x2014;about 800,000 New Yorkers, excluding seniors and the disabled, who live at or below the federal poverty threshold. But the Mayor&apos;s Office has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/metrocard_reduced_fare.php">repeatedly dismissed the half priced MetroCard initiative</a>, estimated to cost about $212 million, as cost prohibitive. </p>

<p>Transit advocates and a veto-proof majority of City Council members <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/25/half_price_metrocards.php">recently responded with a compromise</a>: fund the program in phases, starting with an estimated $50 million in the FY 2018 budget. Again, the Mayor&apos;s Office said no. &quot;The proposal is a noble one but the mayor has been very clear,&quot; Mayoral spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein told Gothamist last month. &quot;The MTA is the responsibility of the state and they should consider funding the program.&quot; </p>

<p>Advocates&apos; proposed pilot would launch with half-price MetroCards for New Yorkers in &quot;deep poverty&quot; who make fifty percent of the federal poverty level or less: $10,000 annually for a family of three, $12,000 annually for a family of four.  About 379,000 New Yorkers would qualify. A second phase would accommodate up to 75 percent of the federal poverty level, ahead of full implementation. </p>

<p>The $50 million ask, they argue, is nearly equivalent to the $51 million NYC spent on fare evasion arrests and prosecution in 2015, as calculated by the Police Reform Organizing Project. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re all smart people,&quot; Morales said on Wednesday. &quot;We can all figure out that those thousands of people [arrested] are costing the city a lot of money.&quot; </p>

<p>City Hall reiterated Wednesday that the MTA should fund reduced fare MetroCards. Meanwhile, the City Council&apos;s MTA budget hearing left several council members exasperated. The only mention of the so-called fair fares initiative was a nod during Transportation Committee Chair Ydanis Rodriguez&apos;s opening remarks. &quot;I am not pleased that the executive budget failed to include any additional funding,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Rodriguez went on to ask the MTA for updates on any plans to expand NYC&apos;s bus network, address <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/mta_freedom_ticket.php">transit deserts</a>, and accommodate straphangers impacted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518012014/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/18/mta_announces_l_train_tunnel_shutdo.php">impending L train shutdown</a>. On each topic, Budget Director Douglas Johnson offered some version of  &quot;we&apos;ll have to get back to you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The amount of information you&apos;re giving us is not even close what we would be expecting from your caliber of an agency,&quot; Budget Committee Chair Julissa Ferreras said. </p>
