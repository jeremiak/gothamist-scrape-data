<p>A team of NYPD narcotics officers conducted simultaneous drug raids in Manhattan and the Bronx on Wednesday, arresting twenty alleged members of a wholesale drug ring and collecting 14 firearms, 14 kilograms of heroin, more than $100,000 in cash and a gallon of liquified PCP from fifteen apartments, according to the Manhattan District Attorney&apos;s office. </p>

<p>All 20 defendants were indicted Thursday, and charged with various counts of conspiracy and criminal sale of a controlled substance. Wayne &quot;Bump&quot; Green was allegedly in charge of the operation, overseeing the heroin supply from packaging to money collection. His partner Ruben &quot;Whitey&quot; Gonzalez allegedly handled phone orders and arranged deliveries. Another defendant, Amado Vega, Jr., allegedly maintained a storage location in the Bronx, while Christopher Morris &quot;tested and maintained the quality of the organization&#x2019;s heroin,&quot; according to the DA&apos;s office. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111405/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-drug-busts-recover-kilos-drugs-200g-cash-guns-article-1.2559148?utm_content=buffer6cc78&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDNLocal+Twitter">The News reports</a> that the heroin was sold as &quot;Thriller,&quot; &#x201C;Crush,&#x201D; &#x201C;OMG&#x201D; and &#x201C;Pepsi.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;With more than one fatal opioid overdose each day, New York City&apos;s heroin crisis is on the rise and reaching epidemic proportions,&quot; said Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance in a statement. </p>

<p>In a separate conspiracy, Green, Gonzalez and Vega Jr. maintained a PCP stash. The bulk arrests marked the end of a 20-month investigation into both operations, and also reportedly turned up eight watches, some gold chains, and a small fleet of BMWs and Nissan Maximas. </p>

<p>Recounting the bust to reporters this week, Deputy Chief Lori Pollock said that the NYPD was &quot;dealing with people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111405/http://nypost.com/2016/03/09/cops-arrest-19-people-over-harlem-gun-and-drug-ring/">who have guns under their pillows</a>.&quot; </p>
