<p>The MTA today confirmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://www.amny.com/transit/w-train-mta-considers-bringing-it-back-between-astoria-lower-manhattan-1.10634651">rumors</a> that it is considering resurrecting the W train&#x2014;that local line from Astoria to Whitehall Street that got the axe in 2010, when the MTA budget deficit was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/24/mta_money_cuomo.php">comparatively-paltry</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/mta_may_eliminate_w_train_among_oth.php">$1.2 billion</a>. </p>

<p>Pending the outcome of a public hearing this spring, the MTA stated on Friday that it could have the W up and running again before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Indeed, the return of the W train is planned to precede the late-2016 opening of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/east_side_access_photos.php">first phase of the Second Avenue Subway</a>, at existing Lexington Av/63 Street, as well as new stations at 72nd Street, 86th Street and 96th Street. The MTA will reroute the Q train, which currently serves Astoria along with the N, to 2nd Avenue between 63rd and 96th. </p>

<p>&quot;The W line would effectively replace Q service in Queens,&quot; the MTA announced today. The local train would not, however, run on weekends or late nights. </p>

<p>Some mass transit advocates said that they were pleasantly surprised by the news. &quot;My Astoria friends are thrilled,&quot; said Nick Sifuentes of the Riders Alliance. &quot;The MTA clearly needed to do something to make sure that Astoria service continues unabated, but it&apos;s kind of funny&#x2014;I don&apos;t think anyone expected it to come back.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s a full breakdown of the proposed service changes along the N/Q/R/W line: </p>

<blockquote>N Line: Service in Queens and Brooklyn remains the same, but trains operate express in Manhattan on weekdays during peak hours, midday and evenings.

<p>Q Line: Northern terminus temporarily changed to 57 St/7 Ave until the Second Avenue Subway opens. At that point, trains will operate from 96 St in Manhattan to Coney Island-Stillwell Av in Brooklyn, stopping at: 86 St, 72 St, Lexington Av/63 St, 57 St/7 Av and all express stops on the Broadway Line in Manhattan. During late nights, the Q will run local between Brooklyn and Manhattan via the Manhattan Bridge. Service in Brooklyn remains the same.</p>

<p>R Line: No service changes.</p>

<p>W Line: Restoration of weekday service, making all local stops from Astoria-Ditmars Blvd to Whitehall St via the Broadway Line. No service on weekends or late night.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Incorporated into the subway system in 2001, the W ran from Astoria all the way to Coney Island until 2004. That year, the W switched to a local route from Astoria to Whitehall. Along with the V train and several bus routes, it was nixed as part of the largest service cut in the MTA&apos;s history&#x2014;at a time when Astoria was seeing an influx of new residents. (&quot;To cut the only service to this neighborhood in half would be like choking the breath out of this community,&quot; Councilmember Peter Vallone Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/mta_may_eliminate_w_train_among_oth.php">said at the time</a>.) </p>

<p>Compared to the MTA&apos;s more ambitious and money-sucking projects (consider the Second Avenue Subway&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/de_blasio_2nd_ave_subay.php">illusive Phase II</a>), reinstating the W would be relatively cheap and easy. For starters, all of the tracks and stations already exist. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://www.amny.com/transit/w-train-mta-considers-bringing-it-back-between-astoria-lower-manhattan-1.10634651">according to AM New York</a>, the MTA has already budgeted for new W train signage and maps. (The MTA says the total cost for implementing the proposed service changes is about $13.7 million.) John Montemarano, the MTA&apos;s director of station signage since 1994, estimated over the summer that his crew would need about four months to prep the system. </p>

<p>Bill Reese, who works in publishing, hosted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/next-stop-on-the-w-train-history/">boozy funeral</a> for the W back in June 2010, cramming the train&apos;s last ride with fellow W enthusiasts. Reese moved to Greenpoint after the W decamped, but has since moved back to Astoria&#x2014;in time for the return of his old reliable. </p>

<p>&quot;I can&apos;t say that I have a fondness for the W on a real personal level, or that I was emotionally devastated [when it left],&quot; he told us on Friday. &quot;But I definitely remember right after they made those budget cuts that it was a lot longer to wait for trains, and that they were more crowded when they showed up.&quot; </p>

<p>Judging by the below footage, a raging subway party in 2010 is basically the equivalent of 2016 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016130710/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/20/obvious_confirmed.php">rush hour</a>. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> An earlier version of this piece inaccurately described the W as a Queens-Manhattan train from its injunction in 2001. In fact, the W ran to Coney Island from 2001-2004. </p>
