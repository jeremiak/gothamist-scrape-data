<p>Two men died after their vehicle crashed into a parked box truck on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens early Friday morning. Witnesses said that the victims were speeding as they approached the parked truck. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, officers responded to the Parkway near 31st Street in Astoria just before 2:45 a.m. on Friday, where they discovered two men unconscious and unresponsive inside a black Hyundai Elantra. Responding EMS declared both men dead on the scene. </p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052135/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/2-die-car-crashes-parked-truck-queens-highway-article-1.2448161">told the Daily News</a> that the victims, who have yet to be identified, appeared to be speeding. &quot;I was going about 50 (MPH) and it flew by me,&quot; he said of the Elantra. &quot;Looked like it was doing about 90 (MPH) flying off the RFK Bridge and it just ran right into the truck.&quot; </p>

<p>A preliminary investigation determined that the victims were driving east on the Parkway when they rear-ended a white box truck parked on the right shoulder of highway, near an overpass at 31st Street. </p>

<p>The driver of the box truck, a 35-year-old man, remained on the scene. An investigation into the crash is ongoing and no charges have been filed. </p>
