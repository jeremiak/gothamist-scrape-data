<p>A 40-foot section of the elevated 5 train platform at the Eastchester-Dyre Avenue station in the Bronx partially collapsed under the weight of heavy machinery on Tuesday night, suspending 5 train service between East 180th Street and Eastchester-Dyre Avenue in both directions. No one was standing on the narrow section of platform that collapsed about one foot onto the tracks, and MTA workers constructed a replacement overnight. Regular service resumed around 6:00 a.m. on Wednesday. </p>

<p>The Eastchester-Dyre Avenue station is currently undergoing repair work, and the heavy machinery that caused the collapse was hidden from riders&apos; view by plywood walls.</p>

<p>Paul Navarro of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://www.twu.org/">Transport Workers Union</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Platform-Collapse-Bronx-5-Train-377199031.html">told reporters</a> that last night marked the second collapse at the station in two weeks. &quot;Maybe they should look at the entire job, because it could easily cause a derailment,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>The MTA did not immediately confirm what type of machinery was being stored on the platform, or how much it weighed. Structural repairs to concrete and steal sections of the elevated tracks between East 180th Street and Eastchester-Dyer Avenue have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://thebronxchronicle.com/2014/11/21/dyre-avenue-projects/">ongoing</a> since the fall of 2014. </p>

<p>Now seems as good a time as any to remind you that the MTA is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/24/bdb_monorail_ftw.php">poised to run out of money</a> by June 30th. The 2015-2019 MTA Capital Plan was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/l_train_shutdown_update.php">revised and approved last week</a>, but Governor Cuomo has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/state_on_cuomos_26_billion_mta_plan.php">yet to specify exactly where his $7.3 billion commitment will come from</a>. MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast recently told skeptical board members that although the state legislature has discussed some proposals, it would be &#x201C;premature or inappropriate to talk about [a funding plan] because nothing&#x2019;s been landed on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The MTA is basically juggling pots of money and moving things around so that they can keep operating as close to normal as possible,&quot; William Henderson, director of the watchdog group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://www.pcac.org/">Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA</a>, told us last month. &quot;The problem is they are getting to the end of that. When you get to that point you make sure that the safety-critical work gets done, whether or not anything else gets done.&quot;</p>

<p><em>If you find this frustrating, tell your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://www.nysenate.gov/">state</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/">representatives</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://www.governor.ny.gov/contact">Governor Cuomo</a> to stop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055807/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/22/mta_so_popular_so_broke.php">robbing the MTA of badly needed funding</a> and figure out a way to come up with more cash for a 21st Century transit system.</em></p>
