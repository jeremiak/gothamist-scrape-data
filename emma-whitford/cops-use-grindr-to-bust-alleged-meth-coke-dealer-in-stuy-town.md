<p>Cops used the gay dating app Grindr to track down and arrest an alleged meth and cocaine dealer in Stuyvesant Town on the East Side last week. </p>

<p>An NYPD source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045317/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160726/stuy-town/police-use-grindr-dating-app-track-down-stuy-town-meth-dealer-nypd-says">told DNAInfo</a> that 55-year-old Harold Gondrez Jr.&apos;s profile on the app included &quot;coded language that the undercover officer recognized as a possible advertisement for drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>Officers raided Gondrez Jr.&apos;s apartment around 6:15 a.m. on July 21st and turned up a &quot;large quantity&quot; of cocaine and meth, according to a department spokesman. The haul included five bags of coke, seven bags of meth, five pipes and $4,000 in cash. </p>

<p>Gondrez Jr. was released without bail following his arrest and is due back in court in September. He&apos;s been charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. </p>

<p>The NYPD has executed a search warrant for the alleged dealer&apos;s apartment, and an investigation into the drug sale operation is ongoing. In the meantime, be careful with potential Grindr dates whose profiles use artful euphemisms like &quot;blow&quot; or &quot;smokin&quot; or &quot;want 2 get hi off all these drrruuugggggsss?&quot;</p>
