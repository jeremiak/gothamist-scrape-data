<p>Police responded to 162 Ridgecrest Avenue in Eltingville at 9:40 a.m. on Tuesday, following a call about a person shooting a squirrel with a bow and arrow, an NYPD spokeswoman said. </p>

<p>&quot;He admitted spontaneously that the call was about him, and that he shot a squirrel on his house with a compound bow and arrow,&quot; she added. </p>

<p>A criminal complaint supplied by the Richmond County DA&apos;s Office details Mangia&apos;s account:</p>

<blockquote>That was me. I saw two rocks and threw them gently up there to scare, did not work, then the squirrel gave me a look and I took it personal. I shot the squirrel, right after I shot the squirrel, he ran on the power lines half way across the street then fell down and ran up the van and the squirrel took the arrow out of himself and ran into the backyard next door.</blockquote>

<p>Mangia was charged with prohibited use of a weapon and reckless endangerment.  </p>
