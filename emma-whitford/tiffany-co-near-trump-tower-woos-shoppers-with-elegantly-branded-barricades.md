<p>In an apparent attempt to convince New Yorkers that the Fifth Avenue Tiffany &amp; Co. is still a viable destination for heart charm bracelets in this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917210602/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/here_have_more_nightmares.php">new fever dream</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917210602/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/trump_president.php#photo-1">reality</a>, the high-end jeweler has switched out some boring, drab, utilitarian NYPD barriers in the shadow of Trump Tower for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917210602/http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/tiffany-co-partners-with-nypd-on-branded-barricades-leading-to-flagship-10728644/">baby-blue branded ones</a>.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Tiffany &amp; Co. confirmed that the NYPD agreed to the switch last month. Tiffany &amp; Co. brought in its own barriers to replace a few directly in front of the store entrance, and donned them with Tiffany logo slip covers on November 23rd. The result is a very on-brand passageway snaking around from 57th Street. </p>

<p>&quot;Tiffany is in frequent communication with the New York Police Department and U.S. Secret Service regarding safety and security along the perimeter of our Fifth Avenue flagship,&quot; the spokesman said. </p>

<p>Not ideal, but Tiffany &amp; Co. is making the best of it! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917210602/http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/tiffany-co-partners-with-nypd-on-branded-barricades-leading-to-flagship-10728644/">From Women&apos;s Wear Daily</a>: </p>

<blockquote>To draw further attention that it&#x2019;s business as usual inside the store, bellhops are stationed along the pathway, each wearing a standard-issue Tiffany-blue scarf, as well as uniform knit hats, neck warmers and gloves. In Thursday&#x2019;s below-freezing weather, many grasped disposable hand-warming sachets.</blockquote>

<p>Reached for comment on the apparent Winter 2016 NYPD x Tiffany &amp; Co. collaboration, an NYPD spokesman said that the barriers themselves are <em>not</em> NYPD property. &quot;Community Affairs has met with store owners in the area to alleviate any concerns they have in regarding security in the area,&quot; he wrote. </p>

<p>In a statement, Tiffany &amp; Co. mentioned <em>other</em> attractions it hopes will convince shoppers to enter the epicenter of Manhattan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917210602/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/nypd_trump_tower_security.php">traffic hell scape</a>. &quot;Our iconic flagship store windows, which feature sparkling scenes of New York City at the holidays, are now on display for all to see,&quot; they promise. &quot;Our fa&#xE7;ade has also been illuminated as planned.&quot; </p>
