<p>In July, less than a week after a hit-and-run driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/02/brooklyn_cyclist_fatality.php">struck and killed</a> Queens man Matthew von Ohlen in a Williamsburg bike lane, the NYPD&apos;s 90th Precinct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/https://twitter.com/NYPD90Pct/status/750716963689816068">tweeted</a> that officers had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/07/camaro_hit_run_williamsburg.php">tracked down the black Chevy Camaro allegedly involved</a>. That car identification was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/williamsburg_cyclist_death.php">most recent public update</a> on von Ohlen&apos;s case. No one has been arrested to date, and no suspects identified. The NYPD has repeatedly refused to say why the driver of the recovered vehicle has not been charged.</p>

<p>The status of von Ohlen&apos;s case is typical, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/traffic_data/leaving_scene-fy-2016nycc.pdf">new statistics from the NYPD</a>. Of 38 fatal hit-and-run crashes between July 2015 and June 2016&#x2014;the most up-to-date statistics available&#x2014;13, or 34 percent, have resulted in an arrest. In 22 hit-and-run crashes where the victim was &quot;seriously injured&quot; by the NYPD&apos;s estimation, 14 arrests have been made. </p>

<p>Taking all fatal and injurious crashes into account&#x2014;including those that resulted in what the NYPD classified as non-serious &quot;personal injuries&quot;&#x2014;the NYPD has made 450 arrests in 5,066 crashes. That&apos;s an arrest rate of about 8 percent. </p>

<p>The fiscal year 2016 hit-and-run data was published late this summer in accordance with a new law requiring the NYPD to issue annual reports on the number of hit-and-run complaints received, compared to the number of arrests made. </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio pledged to catch and punish more hit-and-run drivers during his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/vision_zero_2015_de_blasio.php">annual Vision Zero check-in last December</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/15/hit_run_law_fine_nyc.php">recently passed legislation</a> doubling hit-and-run fines. But this is the first time the NYPD has been compelled to publicly track its progress on hit-and-run cases, according to the office of City Council Majority Leader Jimmy Van Bramer, who sponsored the legislation. </p>

<p>&quot;New data released under my bill, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/15/hit_run_law_fine_nyc.php">Justice for Hit and Run Victims Act</a>, shows that NYPD has failed to make an arrest in more than 90% of cases where a driver has hit a person with their car, then left the scene,&quot; Van Bramer said in a statement Tuesday. &quot;That is an outrage. If you hit someone with your car and then drive away, it&apos;s a crime and should be treated as such.&quot; </p>

<p>For comparison, the arrest rate for murder and non-negligent manslaughter in 2015 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/year_end_2015_enforcement_report.pdf">was 86 percent</a>&#x2014;308 arrests out of 335 incidents. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m glad to see that the information is now being published,&quot; said attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://www.vaccaroandwhite.com/nyc-lawyers-new-york-city-attorneys-protecting-injured-cyclists-pedestrian-victims-adam-white-steve-vaccaro/">Steve Vaccaro</a>, who primarily represents cyclists and pedestrians injured and killed by reckless drivers. &quot;It&apos;s as we knew and suspected&#x2014;that hit and run is the most neglected serious crime going on in New York City today.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayoral spokesman Austin Finan stressed that the Collision Investigation Squad focuses its resources on the most serious crashes&#x2014;where the arrest rates are higher&#x2014;allocating crashes deemed less serious to precinct detectives. </p>

<p>&quot;Property damage incidents&#x2014;which comprise nearly 90% of all hit-and-run cases&#x2014;and non-life-threatening injuries are investigated by detectives,&quot; he said. &quot;Putting CIS investigators on those cases would come at the expense of fully investigating hit and runs that seriously injure or take a life. Targeting the most severe cases and the worst offenders is the way to make our streets safer.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101916_VisionZero.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/101916_VisionZero.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Mayor de Blasio debuting Vision Zero in February 2014, with Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg and then-NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton (Rob Bennett for the Office of Mayor Bill de Blasio). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>But Vaccaro said that he&apos;s troubled by how the NYPD defines a &quot;serious&quot; injury. </p>

<p>Citing his experience litigating against the NYPD on behalf of hit-and-run victims, he said the non-serious category &quot;may include everything from scrapes and bruises and road rash, all the way up to any serious injury that doesn&apos;t involve the person needing life support. You can lose a limb and not need life support.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If you are killed, if you are catastrophically injured, [NYPD] resources are applied,&quot; he added. &quot;I really applaud the fact that the serious injury hit-and-runs have almost a 50 percent arrest rate. It means these cases aren&apos;t intractable.&quot; </p>

<p>In July, 58-year-old hit-and-run driver Jairam Budhu was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/20/queens_hit-and-run_driver_arrested.php">arrested and charged</a> with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and assault after he  ignored a stop sign in South Ozone Park, killing a woman sitting in her Sedan nearby, and seriously injuring her daughter. &quot;With effort, perpetrators can be arrested,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;So why is it that there is an 8 percent arrest rate with the less serious injuries?&quot; </p>

<p>The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for clarity on its methodology for determining what constitutes a &quot;serious injury.&quot; </p>

<p>While the NYPD wasn&apos;t obligated to release statistics on FY 2015, NYPD Inspector Dennis Fulton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/de-blasio-vision-zero-fire-hit-and-run-stats-released-article-1.2834430">testified last December</a> that there were 48 hit-and-run crashes in 2015 that resulted in death or &quot;serious injury,&quot; with 28 arrests. Also last year, there were about 4,000 hit-and-runs that resulted in lesser injuries. According to a December 2015 Transportation Alternatives report, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/deadly_drivers_nyc.php">fewer than 1 percent of these drivers</a> were charged with a crime (advocates have also blamed the borough District Attorneys for this statistic). </p>

<p>&quot;This year, by Labor Day, we had surpassed the number of hit-and-runs we saw in all of 2015,&quot; said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/https://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a> spokesman Brian Zumhagen. &quot;The Department needs to expand the CIS significantly with more officers to investigate these crashes.&quot; </p>

<p>Vaccaro suggested that the NYPD use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article10.htm">penal code definition</a> of &quot;serious personal injury&quot; to determine which hit-and-run cases get CIS investigations. According to that code, &quot;protracted impairment of health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ&quot; falls into the serious injury category. </p>

<p>One of Vaccaro&apos;s past clients, 40-year-old Dulcie Canton, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/08/nypd_bike_hit_run_bushwick.php">struck by a hit-and-run driver</a> while riding her bike in Bushwick in August of 2014. &quot;The guy broke my right shoulder,&quot; Canton told Gothamist shortly after the crash. &quot;And I had a concussion and a really bad sprained left ankle.&quot; Her case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/17/bushwick_cops_crack_down_on_cyclist.php">never got a thorough investigation</a>, according to Vaccaro.</p>

<p>In von Ohlen&apos;s case, a fatality, CIS is investigating. Investigations into fatal hit-and-run crashes can take weeks and even months <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/williamsburg_cyclist_death.php">for myriad reasons</a>. &quot;It&apos;s like any crime,&quot; Vaccaro said. &quot;Criminals don&apos;t make it easy to catch them.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;I don&apos;t think that the NYPD should decide that only the need for life support calls for more resources.&quot;</p>

<p>Former NYPD Commissioner Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/bratton_vision_zero.php">told advocates this spring</a> that that while the NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Squad (CIS) is faced with more traffic incidents than it could possibly investigate, additional CIS officers were not part of his 2016 budget plans. &quot;We will not be increasing significantly the number of [CIS] investigators,&quot; he said. &quot;What we have expanded is [their] responsibility.&quot; Indeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507132718/http://www.streetsblog.org/2014/11/12/vision-zero-year-one-an-early-assessment/">until two years ago</a>, CIS only had the jurisdiction to investigate crashes that resulted in death. </p>
