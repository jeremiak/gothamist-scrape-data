<p>Corey Menafee, a 38-year-old black man who worked until recently as a dishwasher in the dining hall at Yale University&apos;s Calhoun College, was arrested last month after he used a broomstick to smash a stained glass window depicting slaves hoisting cotton. This week, close to a month after the smashing, Yale has stated that the school won&apos;t press charges. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Yale has requested that the State&apos;s Attorney not pursue charges and Yale is not seeking restitution,&quot; said university spokesman Thomas Conroy in a statement. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="061316_Yale2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/061316_Yale2.jpeg" width="320" height="321"> <br> <i style=" width:320px; ;display:block"> Menafee (via Facebook). </i></div> In the immediate aftermath of his mid-June arrest, Menafee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/corey_menafee/">told the New Haven Independent</a> that he was tired of looking at a &quot;racist, very degrading&quot; image during every work shift. After two smacks, the glass shattered and fell to the street outside the hall. <p></p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s 2016,&quot; Menafee said. &quot;I shouldn&apos;t have to come to work and see things like that.&quot; </p>

<p>The Independent reports that Menafee, a father of two and New Haven native, was escorted from the dining hall in handcuffs and charged with criminal mischief, a first-degree felony, and reckless endangerment, a second-degree misdemeanor. </p>

<p>In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237/https://docs.google.com/a/gothamist.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccxTYMuejwyjq7s3n6QybKyrqNQULo9LfClExOYy3oYCyNlA/viewform">open letter to Yale President Peter Salovey</a>, Yale law students decried the arrest. </p>

<p>&quot;You have called the police on a Black man for shattering an image that celebrates Black bondage,&quot; they wrote. &quot;You called the police even though Mr. Menafee presented no immediate threat and you would never have done so if Mr. Menafee were a student. Most shamefully, you called the police in full knowledge of the humiliation of arrest and the potential consequences of prosecution for him and his family.&quot; </p>

Another hearing has been scheduled for July 26th, when the charges will likely be dismissed, according to a source at the state attorney&apos;s office. </p>

<p>While Yale has stated that Menafee apologized to the school and resigned from his post, Menafee has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/corey_menafee/">countered</a> that he lost his job because the university deemed him a threat to the student body (Menafee and his attorney could not immediately be reached for comment). He<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/menafee_court/"> later told the Independent</a> that he resigned as part of a quid-pro-quo agreement, and that the university had promised not to press charges. He did not supply a copy of the alleged agreement to reporters; Yale denied this allegation, stating that &quot;the agreement between the employee and Yale did not include or address the charges against him.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s always better ways of doing things like that than just destroying things,&quot; Menafee told the Independent, admitting that he regretted breaking the glass. &quot;It wasn&apos;t my property, and I had no right to do it.&quot; </p>

<p>Menafee also held firm that the university&apos;s alleged assessment that he posed a threat was unfair. &quot;I didn&apos;t commit any acts of violence against anyone or any living thing,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t be belligerent, or yell. I just broke the windows.&quot; </p>

<p>According to Conroy, the shattered glass fell &quot;onto the street near a passerby, endangering her safety.&quot; </p>

<p>Calhoun College has been the site of student-led protests for the last year, as many take issue with the residential college&apos;s namesake, John C. Calhoun&#x2014;vice president to John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson, and a South Carolina native who adamantly defended slavery. Students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237/http://college.usatoday.com/2015/07/09/after-charleston-shooting-yale-students-petition-to-rename-calhoun-college/">began circulating a petition</a> to change the college&apos;s name last summer, and have since spoken out against other paintings and artifacts on display in the college that, like the cracked stained glass, evoke slavery. </p>

<p>President Salovey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237/http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/calhoun_remains_calhoun/">stated this spring</a> that Calhoun College will keep its name, but charged the Committee on Art in Public Spaces to &quot;assess all of the art on campus, including the windows in Calhoun,&quot; according to Conroy. </p>

<p>&quot;After the window was broken in June, the Committee recommended that it and some other windows be removed from Calhoun, conserved for future study and a possible contextual exhibition, and replaced temporarily with tinted glass,&quot; Conroy added. &quot;An artist specializing in stained glass will be commissioned to design new windows, with input from the Yale community, including students, on what should replace them.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;Yale does not exist in a vacuum. Yale&#x2019;s relationship with a majority-minority New Haven has often been challenging,&quot; the law students wrote in their open letter to Salovey, adding, &quot;What Mr. Menafee did was a service to the University, Yale students, Yale workers and the New Haven community.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021132237/http://www.yaleunions.org/">Local 35 UNITE HERE</a> President Bob Proto, who represents Menafee and other Yale service workers, issued the following statement: </p>

<blockquote>Facing termination and worrying about providing for his family, Mr. Menafee chose to resign; the union stood with Mr. Menafee through this terrible ordeal, and we will stand with him again if Yale is willing to discuss a pathway for Mr. Menafee to return to a Yale University job.</blockquote>
