<p>Lawyers for Peter Liang&#x2014;the former NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050816/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/11/nypd_cop_found_verdict.php">found guilty of manslaughter and misconduct</a> last month in the fatal 2014 shooting of 28-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050816/http://gothamist.com/tags/akaigurley">Akai Gurley</a>&#x2014;confirmed that their client apologized in person to Gurley&apos;s domestic partner Kimberly Ballinger on Thursday. </p>

<p>The meeting, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050816/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/nyregion/peter-liang-apologizes-to-akai-gurleys-partner.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;_r=1&amp;mtrref=undefined">the NY Times reports</a> lasted for five minutes in a conference room at the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office, came one day after Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050816/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/23/brooklyn_da_recommends_no_jail_time.php">recommended five years of probation</a>, six months of house arrest, and 500 hours of community service for Liang, in lieu of prison time. </p>

<p>&quot;He said he was very sorry, that he knows how difficult it is to lose a loved one and that this [shooting] was the last thing he could have ever imagined happening,&quot; Paul Shechtman, one of Liang&apos;s attorneys, told the paper. Shechtman, of Zuckerman Spaeder Law Firm, is one of two new attorneys brought on to Liang&apos;s case since the convictions. Last week, he and his team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050816/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/16/attorneys_move_to_overturn_manslaug.php">filed a motion</a> to overturn the convictions on the grounds that the rookie cop did not receive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050816/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/liang_nypd_cpr_class.php">adequate CPR training</a>. </p>

<p>In his statement this week, Thompson argued that there is &quot;no evidence... that [Liang] intended to kill or injure Akai Gurley.&quot; Thompson also said that prison is not warranted in part because Liang has no prior criminal record, and &quot;poses no future threat to public safety.&quot;</p>

<p>Prosecutors for the Brooklyn DA&apos;s Office made the case during Liang&apos;s trial that the officer and his partner had stalled for several minutes after shooting Gurley, arguing over who should call their superior while Gurley lay dying. Liang&apos;s defense countered that the officer attempted to get help much sooner, and presented Liang as an overwhelmed rookie who pulled the trigger by accident. </p>

<p>Also on Thursday, dozens of protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630050816/http://www.wnyc.org/story/supporters-akai-gurley-say-da-thompson-failed-black-community/">joined Gurley&apos;s family</a> outside of the Brooklyn DA&apos;s office to protest Thompson&apos;s recommendation. &quot;He failed the family, he failed myself, and he failed the people who put him into office,&quot; Gurley&apos;s aunt Hertencia Petersen told the crowd. </p>

<p>In a statement issued this week, Gurley&apos;s family denounced DA Thompson for &quot;[sending] the message that officers can continue to kill Black New Yorkers without consequence.&quot;</p>

<p>East New York Councilmember Inez Baron also addressed Thompson directly, warning, &quot;Don&apos;t ever come to us for anything... because we are revolted by your actions and we will never forget.&quot; </p>

<p>Liang&apos;s lawyers had reportedly been asking Ballinger for a month if she would meet with the man who killed her partner and the father of her three-year-old daughter, Akaila. According to Ballinger&apos;s attorney Scott Rynecki, she finally agreed, determined to describe her grief and suffering to Liang directly. </p>

<p>&quot;Ms. Ballinger.. [let] him know that because of his actions that night, she now has a 3-year-old who doesn&apos;t have a father,&quot; Rynecki told the Times. &quot;She no longer has a partner, and her life has been turned upside down. And she let him know that Akai was a good, innocent man and a good father.&quot;</p>

<p>Liang is scheduled for sentencing on April 14th, and faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>
